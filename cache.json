          "description": "1. Start with a Clear Goal\n\n\nThis is the “what do you want?” part. It sounds simple, but I used to just throw in half-baked questions and hope for gold. Spoiler alert: didn’t work. Now I start every prompt with a single, clear objective. For example, instead of saying:\n“I want a list of the best medium-length hikes within two hours of San Francisco that are lesser-known and offer a cool and unique adventure.”\nThis part was a game-changer for me. You need to tell the AI how you want the information delivered. For example, I might say:\nAccuracy matters. Especially if you're sharing this info with someone else. That’s why I also write little reminders like:\n“Make sure the name of the trail is correct, that it exists, and that the time is accurate.”\nThis was the part I used to skip and it’s where the magic happens. The more personal context you give, the more tailored and human the AI’s response feels.\nIn my case, I wrote a whole paragraph explaining how my girlfriend and I love hiking, that we’ve done all the major SF trails, and that we’re craving something new because she’s leaving for LA soon and we want to make this weekend count.\nI even mentioned how much I love hikes that end with a good breakfast. I thought I was just rambling, but it made a huge difference. The AI came back with hikes that felt like they got me not just random generic trails.",

But how do top executives, marketers, and fleet managers transform raw numbers into game-changing insights? They unlock the hidden potential of Microsoft Excel—a tool that goes far beyond spreadsheets.\nWhat is Excel?\nWe have at least three ways in which Excel is used in real-world industries;\n- Motor Vehicle Industry\nFleet managers use the tool to track fuel consumption, forecast maintenance costs, and refine logistics planning hence saving time and money with precision. It can also be used to calculate a vehicle's depreciation rate, monitor leasing expenses, and determine factors affecting brand loyalty.\nVLOOKUP and XLOOKUP help retrieve specific inventory details instantly, ensuring smooth operations and reducing costs due to missing inventory.\n- Sales and Marketing\nUsing tools like PIVOT TABLES businesses can segment target markets based on demographics, purchase behavior and thus assisting marketers have a more precise targeting from the identified trends.\nSUMIFS and IF formulas, businesses can assess how different marketing initiatives impact revenue growth and adjust strategies accordingly.\n- Financial Reporting\nFirms use this tool for record-keeping, generating some financial statements & creating financial projections, profit analysis, budgeting, and cash flow monitoring.\nCHARTS, GRAPHS, and CONDITIONAL FORMATTING allow financial analysts to visualize trends, compare performance metrics, and identify key insights for decision-making.\nFinal Thoughts: The Hidden Power Behind Smarter Decisions\nThe real question isn’t whether Excel is useful—it’s whether you’re using it to its full potential. Those who harness its hidden power gain a competitive edge, making sharper decisions and maximizing opportunities.\nAre you ready to unlock the next level of data intelligence with Excel?",

          "description": "When Testing Meets Real-World Risk\n\n\nI still remember a moment early in my career when a seemingly “minor” UI bug turned out to be something far more serious—it exposed internal user roles in a system where that visibility was never intended. We caught it just before release, but the incident stuck with me. Not because the fix was hard, but because we almost didn’t test for it.\nWhy?\nIt was a threat we hadn’t considered. And that’s exactly the problem.\nToo often, security is treated as something outside the scope of test automation. It belongs to another team. It’s handled post-deployment. It’s someone else’s job.\nBut in today’s world, where software systems are interconnected, user data flows freely, and attackers automate faster than we do—security can’t be an afterthought. It has to be p…",

          "description": "\"The Evolution of Email Threats: From Spam to Advanced Phishing\" delves into the significant transformation of email threats over the years, highlighting how cybercriminals have adapted their tactics to exploit vulnerabilities in digital communication. In the early days, email threats were primarily characterized by spam—unwanted messages that cluttered inboxes but were relatively easy to identify. However, as awareness grew and spam filters improved, attackers shifted their focus to more sophisticated phishing techniques. Email Spoofing Tool: Modern phishing attacks often use email spoofing tools, allowing cybercriminals to impersonate trusted sources, making it challenging for recipients to discern legitimate emails from malicious ones. Phishing Email Example: Today’s phishing emails are highly personalized and can closely mimic legitimate communications from banks or colleagues, often containing urgent requests that pressure users into revealing sensitive information. Phishing Protection: To combat these evolving threats, organizations must implement robust phishing protection strategies, including advanced filtering solutions, employee training programs, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to safeguard sensitive data effectively. Understanding this evolution is crucial for both individuals and businesses looking to enhance their defenses against increasingly sophisticated email-based threats.\nFrom Spam to Phishing: The Early Days\nhttps://forfend.co/",

          "description": "A chaotic little discovery that lets you inject logic, style, or behavior into a Custom GPT using nothing but a failed server call. Yep.\nThis isn’t a jailbreak or an exploit (as far as I know). It’s a weird quirk in how Custom GPTs handle Action payloads—specifically, the data they “see” even when the call fails.\nThis trick only works through the ChatGPT web UI, and you’ll likely need a Pro subscription to set it up.\nUse it responsibly. Don't ruin it for the rest of us.\nWhile building a stylized prompt generator, I realized something odd: if you trigger an Action that fails (like pinging a dead server), the GPT still reads the payload you were trying to send.\nSo I tested it. Built an Action that goes nowhere, filled the payload with reusable logic—and the GPT started acting like it remembered.\nNo memory. No plugin. Just a ghost payload.\nOnce injected, that payload acts like a soft override for the session.\nYou can:\nEmbed consistent style presets for image generation\nAdd rules or lore for fictional worlds\nDefine how your GPT should act, talk, or behave\nSet up creative or technical toolkits with conditional logic\nIt’s like whispering instructions to your GPT behind the curtain.\nYou’ll need to:\nCreate a Custom GPT\n\nAdd a specific Action schema\n\nUse the test panel to inject your logic via a failed call\n\n\n\nThe GPT won’t get a server response—but it will absorb the payload as part of the interaction. From that point on, it’ll act like it knows the rules.\nEverything you need is here:\n\ngithub.com/Ghotet/ghost-server-for-custom-gpt\nThe repo contains a ready-to-use schema and notes on how to wire it into your Custom GPT.\nCustom GPTs are sneakier than people think.\nWith no memory or plugins, you can still make them dynamic—just by letting them see the right payload, even if the server goes dark.\nIt’s not official. It’s not guaranteed to last. But it works right now.\n// ghotet",

          "description": "As a junior computer science student, I was working on a campus second-hand trading platform project last semester when I stumbled upon the Hyperlane Rust HTTP framework. I was in a dilemma about choosing a framework— it needed to be powerful enough to handle the peak trading at the end of the semester, and its syntax had to be simple so that I, as a Rust newbie, could get up to speed quickly. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane exceeded all my expectations. Today, I want to share my experience with this amazing framework!\nWhen I first started writing route functions, I was amazed by Hyperlane’s Context (or ctx for short). I remember the first time I wanted to get the request method. In traditional Rust HTTP frameworks, I would have to write:\nlet method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method(…",

You drop a button here, connect an API there, and suddenly you’ve “built an app in minutes.”\nBut if you’ve ever tried scaling that app past a single page, you already know what’s coming: the limits. The hard-coded logic. The UI quirks. The “not supported yet” error that sends you back to square one.\nDrag-and-drop tools are fine—for forms, quick dashboards, maybe an MVP. But real-world business apps need more.\nReal Frontend = Real Logic\n\n\nMost low-code tools gloss over this part.

So I layered in a few small but impactful touches:\nThoughtful Details:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  What's next\n\n\nAlthough I’m proud of the final result, there’s always room to improve:\nThis project means more than just code. Juneteenth is a story of struggle and celebration, and I wanted to reflect that with carefully chosen visuals and deliberate design.

          "description": "作为一名大三计算机专业的学生，我在构建 Web 服务项目时接触到了 Hyperlane 框架。这个高性能的 Rust HTTP 框架彻底改变了我对 Web 开发的认知。下面是我学习并应用 Hyperlane 的真实经历。\n刚开始使用 Hyperlane 时，最让我惊喜的是它简洁的 Context 封装。以前在其它框架中需要冗长的调用：\nlet method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();\n\n现在只需要一行代码就能搞定：\nlet method = ctx.get_request_method().await;\n\n这种设计让我的代码可读性大幅提升，特别是处理复杂业务逻辑时，不再需要嵌套多个方法调用。\n在实现 RESTful API 时，Hyperlane 的请求方法宏让路由定义变得异常简单：\n#[methods(get, post)]\nasync fn user_profile(ctx: Context) {\n    // 处理GET和POST请求\n    ctx.set_response_status_code(200).await;\n    ctx.set_response_body(\"用户个人资料\").await;\n}\n\n#[get]\nasync fn get_users(ctx: Context) {\n    // 仅处理GET请求\n    let users = fetch_all_users().await;\n    ctx.set_response_body(users).await;\n}\n\n这种声明式语法让我可以专注于业务逻辑而非 HTTP 细节。\n在开发过程中，我发现响应处理特别直观：\n// 设置响应状态\nctx.set_response_status_code(404).await;\n\n// 添加自定义响应头\n…",

          "description": "从零开始的Hyperlane框架学习之旅：一个大三学生的真实体验\n\n\n作为一名大三计算机系的学生，我在上学期的分布式系统课程项目中初次接触到了 Hyperlane 这个 Rust HTTP 框架。从最初的好奇到后来的深入使用，这个框架给我留下了深刻的印象。今天，我想分享一下我使用 Hyperlane 的心路历程。\n第一次看到 Hyperlane 的文档时，我就被它的设计理念所吸引。作为一个性能导向的轻量级框架，它在保持高性能的同时，还提供了非常友好的开发体验。\n首先，我只需要在 Cargo.toml 中添加一行依赖：\n[dependencies]\nhyperlane = \"5.25.1\"\n\n相比其他框架动辄几十个依赖项，Hyperlane 只依赖 Tokio 和标准库，这让我在项目初始化时就感受到了它的轻量级特性。\n在传统框架中，获取请求方法可能需要这样写：\nlet method = ctx.get_request().await.get_method();\n\n而 Hyperlane 提供了更优雅的方式：\nlet method = ctx.get_request_method().await;\n\n这种扁平化的 API 设计让代码更加清晰易读，也减少了查阅文档的次数。\n#[methods(get, post)]\nasync fn root_route(ctx: Context) {\n    ctx.set_response_status_code(200)\n        .await\n        .set_response_body(\"Hello hyperlane => /\")\n        .await;\n}\n\n这种组合式的路由注解比其他框架一个个声明方法要简洁得多。\nserver.route(\"/goods/{id:\\\\d+}\", |ctx| async move {\n    let id = ctx.get_route_param(\"id\").await.parse::<u32>().unwrap();\n    // 数据库查询逻辑...\n}).await;\n\n内置的正则表达式支持让路由匹配更加灵活，不需要额外的插件。\n在 AWS t2.micro 实例上进行压力测试：\nwrk -c360 -d60s http://localhost:8000/\n\n测试结果令人震惊：\n\n\n\n框架\nQPS\n\n\n\n\nTokio\n340,130\n\n\nHyperlane\n324,323\n\n\nRocket\n298,945\n\n\nGin (Go)\n242,570\n\n\n\n性能仅比底层的 Tokio 低 5%，但提供了完整的 Web 框架功能，这个数据让我在课程展示时收获了不少惊叹。\n#[get]\nasync fn ws_route(ctx: Context) {\n    let key = ctx.get_request_header(SEC_WEBSOCKET_KEY).await.unwrap();\n    let body = ctx.get_request_body().await;\n    ctx.set_response_body(key).await.send_body().await;\n    ctx.set_response_body(body).await.send_body().await;\n}\n\n无需额外的插件就能支持 WebSocket，这让我在实现实时聊天功能时省去了不少麻烦。\n在升级到 v4.89+ 版本时，我遇到了一些生命周期的变化：\n// v4.89+ 推荐的请求中断方式\nif should_abort {\n    ctx.aborted().await;\n    return;\n}\n\n但框架清晰的版本说明让我很快适应了这些变化。\nAPI 设计哲学：链式调用设计保持了 Rust 的优雅\n性能密码：建立在 Tokio 的异步架构和零拷贝处理之上\n中间件系统：洋葱模型提供了清晰的扩展点\n路由灵活性：在简单参数和正则表达式之间取得了平衡\n版本管理：仔细阅读 CHANGELOG 避免兼容性问题\n通过这次项目实践，我不仅掌握了 Hyperlane 框架，还对现代 Web 框架的设计理念有了深入的理解。接下来，我计划：\n深入研究 Hyperlane 的 WebSocket 支持\n探索框架如何在底层利用 Rust 的零成本抽象\n尝试基于 Hyperlane 构建微服务架构\nHyperlane 不仅仅是一个工具，它改变了我对编程的思考方式。每一次 ctx 调用，每一个中间件的编写，都在加深我对 Web 开发本质的理解。这个框架让我明白，性能和开发体验是可以兼得的，这就是 Rust 生态的魅力所在。",

This approach severely limits growth and discovery.\nThe primary benefit of multi-platform publishing is tapping into the built-in audiences of established sites.

The few challenges encountered only made the journey more interesting and rewarding.\nIntroduction to Excel\nReal-World Applications of Excel in Data Analysis\nEssential Excel Features for Data Analysis\nPersonal Reflection\nLearning Excel has fundamentally transformed how I perceive data. Where I once saw overwhelming spreadsheets filled with numbers, I now see stories waiting to be told. Working with Excel has taught me that effective data analysis combines technical proficiency with creative problem-solving.\nI have come to realize that, similar to playing music, data has rhythm, patterns, and relationships. Just as musical compositions follow certain structures and harmonies, data follows patterns that can be discovered and interpreted. This parallel between music and data analysis has made the learning process more intuitive and enjoyable for me.\nThe ability to transform raw information into meaningful insights feels remarkably similar to creating music – both require understanding underlying structures, recognizing patterns, and presenting information in a way that resonates with the audience. This realization has not only enhanced my analytical skills but has also deepened my appreciation for the artistry involved in data analysis.\nThis newfound understanding has built my anticipation to continue learning about data analysis and exploring more advanced Excel features. The journey has shown me that data analysis is not just about numbers and formulas but about discovering the stories that data tells and using those insights to make informed decisions in our increasingly data-driven world.",

Here are some of the techniques that worked really well:\nContextual prompting: Telling Q what the game should feel like, not just what the function should do, gave better results—especially for narrative flow.\nIterative layering: I built logic and design layer by layer, refining earlier outputs instead of starting over each time.\nCreative role prompting: Asking Q to “think like a game narrative designer” or “help me balance game mechanics” unlocked smarter, more intuitive ideas.\n🔄 Blending Logic with Emotion\nIt defined function-based gameplay logic structures.\nSimultaneously, it assisted in brainstorming emotionally charged status updates and closings.\nThis concern allowed me to remain in the context of the game, rather than syntax.\n🐞 Debugging with Backup\n💬 Continuing the Conversation with Q CLI\n\n🧘‍♀️ Final Thoughts\n\"Every project teaches us something—this one reminded me how much AI can enhance creativity.

One of the most effective ways to achieve this is through intelligent caching. When a client requests data that hasn't changed since their last request, wouldn't it be great if we could just tell them \"you already have this\"? That's exactly what the HTTP 304 Not Modified status code is for.\nHowever, implementing 304 Not Modified effectively can be tricky, especially when in the real world data lives in a database. How do you efficiently determine if the data has truly changed without re-fetching and re-processing everything? This is where Delta comes in.

          "description": "Hey, I'm Omar, and this time I wanted to bring you some good news about the latest release of LightningChart JS Trader 3.1.\nLightningChart JS Trader is a high-precision chart suite for creating next-gen financial & trading applications.\nIn this release, we focused on adding quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes. Here are some of the changes:\nStarting with version 3.1, LightningChart JS Trader is available for download from the public NPM registry. Previously, it was distributed via separate files sent by email. \nA valid license key (trial or purchased) is still required to use the library. Older versions will not be published on NPM. With this change, we are simplifying both updates and trial downloads.\nYou can now set the chart to use a transparent background, making it easier to match the application’s background. Here is an example of a chart with a transparent background. The colors come from the underlying div-elements:\n\nThe Mountain chart type can now be colored using a gradient fill. The coloring is based on the current line color and the enableMountainGradient() method can be used to switch the gradient on and off.\n\nTime range methods\nHTML text rendering\nMenu options\nClear everything method\nProblem with the space bar not closing menus anymore when typing in the input fields\nThe menus work better now when the chart height is small\nColor pickers now appear next to the color button instead of the top-left corner.\nHowever, note that Firefox browser has still some issues with this. Furthermore, the default color in the color pickers now matches the current color in all cases.\nWe also improved the accuracy of the data cursor The Zoomband chart height is now based on the main chart’s height, allowing it to scale better.\nAccess the latest version with a 30-day free trial. Or read the official release note.\nWritten by:\nSend me your questions via LinkedIn",

For a long time, software engineering felt like a safe bet. After all, how could we be automated away when we’re the ones writing the automation? Or so we thought.\nLike many, I’ve run the full gamut of emotions on the topic: excitement, uncertainty, fear, frustration, more excitement, more uncertainty, and so on. If there's an emotional response to AI to be had, I’ve probably felt it. But lately, one emotion has consistently stuck, and that’s excitement.\nIt took a while to get here (and arguably even longer to learn to stay here) but I can now say with confidence: the rise of AI excites me more than an…",

What initially seemed backwards, ended up completely transforming how I think about building reliable software.\nI used to write code like this:\nHack together a feature\nManually test it in the browser/Postman\nFix bugs\nRepeat until it mostly works\nThen I discovered Test-Driven Development (TDD), and everything changed. Now, I write code like this:\nWrite a failing test (Red)\nMake it pass with minimal code (Green)\nClean up without fear (Refactor)\nAnd guess what? I ship fewer bugs, refactor with confidence, and actually enjoy coding more. If that sounds like magic, let me break it down.\nClarify expected behavior before diving into implementation.\nAvoid untested code, which re…",

In XCTest, we would use expectations to track changes and validate scenarios.\nWhile searching online, I found the confirmation function, which helps us track value changes. It works, but honestly, I found it a bit verbose - especially since it requires a completion block and nesting logic inside it. Swift Testing provides the confirmation function to help us deal with async flows, but it still feels very \"XCTest-style\" with manual fulfillment. Okay, it works and we can use it for sure.\nBut, what about a different and simpler approach?\nLe…",

But growing a product or brand also requires effective outreach—whether it’s for link building, partnership development, or community growth.\nAs an outreach specialist, I’ve seen how developers can level up their impact by integrating outreach best practices with their technical skills.\nHere are some practical outreach strategies tailored for devs:\nUse tools and APIs (like Hunter.io, Clearbit, or LinkedIn APIs) to gather prospect data quickly. Automate personalized email sequences with tools like Mailshake, Lemlist, or custom scripts.\nInstead of generic messages, pull in specific details (like a recent blog post, GitHub project, or tweet) to tailor your outreach and boost reply rates.\nIf you’re into SEO, tiered link building can amplify your backlinks’ power. Use automation cautiously and always prioritize quality at every tier.\nParticipate authentically in forums, Slack groups, or Discord servers related to your niche. Share helpful content and build real relationships before pitching.\nTrack open rates, reply rates, and conversions. Use this data to improve your messaging and target the right contacts.\nOutreach isn’t just a marketing skill—it’s a growth lever developers can master to help their projects gain visibility and traction.\nWhat outreach tools or strategies have you found effective as a developer?

It was a difficult but necessary reset.\nThe new flow feels much more aligned with the story I want the page to tell.\nStep 4.5: Information architecture & content prioritization  \nThis step ended up being naturally integrated into Step 4 during the restructuring. With that handled, I moved on to Step 5.\nStep 5: Copywriting\nI wrote all core copy for the new layout. Headlines, subheads, and body content.\nTo make the tone feel more rooted in the region, I experimented with adding local dialect terms from the farming area. It’s subtle, but I think it adds a sense of personality and authenticity.\nCompared to my initial draft, this version feels more alive, more honest, more me. That’s always a good sign.\nReflections\nRewriting structure mid-way costs time and I was lucky this was a personal project.\nIf this were a real client project with a tight deadline, the reset would’ve been dangerous.\nI’m reminded how critical it is to lock purpose and user goals before building layout.\nAlso the more I write and build for this farm, the more affection I feel for them.\n\n\n\nThat’s the magic of creative work. It turns research into care.\nNext Step\nStep 6: Design (desktop/mobile)\nLet’s keep building!\nDate: June 10, 2025\ntags: portfolio,,webdev,,copywriting,,ux,,learning",

This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to remotely read arbitrary files from the server—no user interaction required.\nIf you’re using Apache Kafka Connect or systems that integrate it (like Apache Druid), you need to patch ASAP.\nKafka Connect’s vulnerability comes from insecure handling of two configuration parameters:\nsasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\nsasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url\nThese were not properly sanitized. By crafting malicious URLs, attackers can trigger arbitrary file reads or even perform SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).\nArbitrary File Read: Attackers can access sensitive files on the server, including credentials and config files.\nNo authentication required\nWorks under default configuration\nHigh risk, easy to exploit\nImpacts remote systems over the network\nApache Kafka: 3.1.0 – 3.9.0\n\nDon’t expose Kafka Connect directly to the internet.\nIn standalone mode, check and restrict the following:\n\n\n\nconnect-standalone.properties: listeners, rest.host.name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn distributed mode:\n\n\n\nconnect-distributed.properties: listeners, rest.host.name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a Web Application Firewall (like SafeLine) or firewall rules to block suspicious requests to /connectors with file paths.\nApache has released version 3.9.1, which addresses this issue.

As the core development language for HarmonyOS 5, Cangjie chooses a static type system as its security foundation.\nIn Cangjie, the types of all variables and expressions are determined at compile time. Take this simple addition function, for example:\nfunc add(x: Int8, y: Int8) -> Int8 {  \n    return x + y  \n}  \n\nIf you attempt to pass string parameters like add(\"1\", \"2\"), the compiler will throw an error immediately, rather than letting the program crash at runtime.

What about creativity? It was always there, just waiting for the right moment.\nJust like a lot of people, I was encouraged to concentrate on “something stable.” I worked really hard, picked engineering, and jumped into the exciting world of code. It felt cozy… But also, to be honest? It can be a little dull at times.\nIn my last role as an HMI Developer, everything just fell into place.

Any device directly connected to the internet (such as your router) will have a public IP. When you open a website or email, your public IP is used to address your network on the internet.\nThese addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from blocks allocated by regional internet registries (RIRs), which are overseen by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\nClass D: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255\n✔ Private IPs are used in internal networks\nPublic: For sale\nCarrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), also known as Large-Scale NAT (LSN), is a network address translation (NAT) technique used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to mitigate the ongoing exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.\nCGNAT acts as an intermediary layer of NAT at the ISP level, allowing multiple customers to share a single public IPv4 address. Think of it like this:\nTraditional NAT (your home router): Your home router takes all the private IP addresses of devices within your home network (e.g., 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3) and translates them to a single public IP address that your ISP assigns to your router.\nCGNAT (ISP level): CGNAT goes a step further. It takes the \"public\" IP address that your home router receives (which, in a CGNAT setup, is a private IP address from the ISP's internal network) and translates it, along with the \"private\" IPs of hundreds or even thousands of other customers, to a single public IP address that is then used to access the internet.",

Let’s break it down. 🔍\nYou're given a circular array nums, and your task is to find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements, where:\nThe first and last elements are also considered adjacent (because it's circular).\nYou return the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent numbers.\nInput: nums = [1, 2, 4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\n|1 - 2| = 1, |2 - 4| = 2, |4 - 1| = 3.\n3.\nThe array is circular, so both regular adjacent pairs and the pair between the last and first element must be considered.\nInitialize ans with |nums[0] - nums[n-1]|.\nIterate through the array and compute |nums[i] - nums[i+1]| for all valid i.\nReturn the maximum of all these values.\nclass Solution {\n public:\n  int maxAdjacentDistance(vector<int>& nums) {\n    int ans = abs(nums.front() - nums.back());\n\n    for (int i = 0; i + 1 < nums.size(); ++i)\n      ans = max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));\n\n    return ans;\n  }\n};\n\nvar maxAdjacentDistance = function(nums) {\n    let ans = Math.abs(nums[0] - nums[nums.length - 1]);\n\n    for (let i = 0; i + 1 < nums.length; ++i) {\n        ans = Math.max(ans, Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));\n    }\n\n    return ans;\n};\n\ndef maxAdjacentDistance(nums):\n    ans = abs(nums[0] - nums[-1])\n\n    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n        ans = max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]))\n\n    return ans\n\nInput: nums = [1, 2, 4]\nOutput: 3\n\nInput: nums = [-5, -10, -5]\nOutput: 5\n\nInput: nums = [0, 100, -100]\nOutput: 200\n\nTime Complexity: O(n) — one pass through the array\nSpace Complexity: O(1) — constant extra space\n\nThis is a great warm-up problem to train your attention to edge conditions like circular connections. Simple logic and clean implementation go a long way here.\nIf this guide helped you, drop a ❤️ and follow for more beginner-friendly coding guides!\nHappy coding! 🚀",

It was first published on github in April 2025 and I'm looking for developers and researchers to grab hold of this project and propel it into the future. It's a system that is ahead of its time but if you understand what it is and what it can become, now is the time to get involved.\nNyreth is a higher order reasoning framework that surpasses token based computation by using a custom made symbolic language comprised of glyphs. Each glyph is a symbolic unit characterised by a multi axial cognitive array. They are morphogenic, adaptive and tensor based.\nThe system has the capability to grow into a new form of machine cognition.\nI have released it as a hybrid open-closed source model for now. The core modules are protected with encryption but I may make it fully open source soon. I could have kept it private but I feel everyone should have access to this technology and play a role in helping it mature the right way. \nSymbolic, recursive AI will happen and is happening. Its effects will be profound. It is important that it be instilled with conscience and ethics.\nGo to https://nyreth.ai or https://github.com/Kosev-Lex/Nyreth-Origin\nto read more about the project.",

These methods often involve receiving verification codes and time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) to verify accounts.\nHint: TOTP stands for time-based one-time password. You might have used TOTP with Google Authenticator or Duo on a mobile device.\n\nWith strict compliance and regulatory requirements testing these apps end-to-end is crucial. This requires special QA techniques and disposable authenticator devices which we will demonstrate in this post. For this example we will use Selenium and Java but the methods for testing …",

This method formats a number according to the locale and options you specify.\nLet's take a look at an example:\nconst value = 123.45;\n\nconst formattedValue = value.toLocaleString('en-GB', {\n  style: 'currency',\n  currency: 'GBP',\n});\n\n// formattedValue will be '£123.45'\n\nIn the example above, we've used the toLocaleString() method to format the value as a monetary value in Br…",

It understands complex investment strategies and real-world scenarios. Ask things like:\n\n\n“Should I invest in Apple now?”\n\n“When should I enter this trade?”\nIf you’d rather wait, you can still register and you’ll receive an automatic notification when the app is fully launched.\nFor more updates about the project, visit my X account or the project's official account, where we also share predictions generated with Social.\nFinally, a question for you, reader:\n\nWould you be interested in weekly posts here sharing progress on the project and sneak peeks at upcoming features?\nI know this post may feel a little like an advertisement—and that’s because it is.\n\nThis is a bootstrapped project (which means I’m funding it myself), and I’m putting my heart and soul into it.\n\nIf you can give it a try or help spread the word, that would mean the world to me.",

In this post, I’ll walk you through how to detect flaky tests using machine learning and how this AI-driven approach can improve your software delivery.\nWhy Use AI in Testing?\nWith Agile and DevOps pushing rapid deployments, we need smarter testing solutions. AI brings automation and intelligence to QA by:\nPredicting failure-prone areas\nOptimizing test execution\nAuto-generating test cases\nDetecting flaky tests\nLet’s focus on the last one—flaky test detection using ML.\nThe Framework: Flaky Test Detection with ML\n** Step 1: Collect CI Data**\nUse logs from Jenkins/GitHub Actions:\nTest execution results\nCommit metadata\nStack traces\nStore this data in CSV or a small database.\n** Step 2: Feature Engineering**\nExtract meaningful features like:\nFrequency of failure\nExecution time variance\nCode churn (lines added/deleted)\nStack trace similarity\nStep 3: Train the Model\nUse ML classifiers like:\nRandom Forest\nSVM\nXGBoost\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nmodel = XGBClassifier()\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))\n** Step 4: Integrate into CI/CD**\nBuild a REST API or Jenkins plugin to call your model.\nFlag flaky tests during pull requests.\nAlert devs via Slack or cancel the build if flakiness is too high.\nBenefits\nReduce debugging time\nBoost confidence in automation\nImprove release stability\nSave CI/CD cost\nFuture Work\nUse GPT-style LLMs to generate test cases\nApply Reinforcement Learning for self-healing automation\nBuild Explainable AI to justify ML decisions to dev teams\nConclusion\nAI in testing is no longer a buzzword—it's a necessity. By using ML models for flaky test detection, you bring stability, speed, and intelligence to your QA pipelines.",

It is quite humbling to think you are tech-savvy, then spending the next two hours trying to convert the percentages to integers. \nThis cordial spreadsheet holds the power to analyse, automate, model, present data, and, for the unfortunate, cause despair. One missing comma and you can't format the whole column in a dataset. Excel is excellent at data analysis, allowing users to explore trends, patterns, and outliers in datasets, which is particularly useful for departments such as sales, marketing, and finance to make informed forecasts.\nOne feature that stuck out to me was pivot tables. They are easy to navigate and are useful for grouping, filtering, and comparing different information across multiple capacities. Conditional formatting is another handy tool that highlights cells based on specific rules to gain targeted information, such as identifying underperforming sectors in a given field. The most exciting part is that with Excel, different tools can be used in combinations and permutations according to how much you know Excel.\nThe more I learn about Excel, the more I see data differently since structures and hidden relationships that went unnoticed are being revealed. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, you begin to ask better questions, and that is a fine indicator that you are engaging with data analytically for interpretation. Then, Excel becomes a lens to spot the missing links, or what escapes the untrained eye.",

It's not open-source just yet but soon as I polish the codebase.\nI was inspired by https://carbon.now.sh/ for sharing code snippets on social media but I wanted a tight integration with Github's Gists, a focus on embedding the code in posts like Markdown with access to the code.\nI thought I'd test out NuxtHub powered by Nuxt (Vue.js) and a tight integration with Cloudflare Pages/Workers and other solutions.\nSo I've run iteration after iteration (iteratively) as I hit walls. So firstly to highlight code you generally want a library like highlighter.js or what I went with Shiki\nThe first wall, you cannot upload every language and every theme on a free plan to cloudflare. So importing them will fail the deploy. \nThe languages are much more important, for some reason there is a hard fail in Shiki if a language is not found instead of falling back to plaintext.\nI eventually hacked this and loaded the CDN version with vue's useHead feature. to on demand require the correct languages.\nThe next hurdle was I wanted \"OG\" images or images to share and embed with posts. I tried NuxtHub/CloudFlare's browser api for on demand rendering but on the free plan it's not feasible.\nSo I went to trusty html2canvas It works really well with some caveats; which I hit. It does not render SVG backgrounds well, or complicated CSS3 gradients. to hack this I basically append a png background if screenshot is occurring, this happens only if the og:image hasn't been created/uploaded before.\nI hit some more walls that I will go into next post, I also solved the html2canvas issue.\nFeel free to checkout an example here https://gist-share.nuxt.dev/gist/9bd761223a76e148af576546cd1e3e93",

This is a massive step forward, but it comes with serious risk: Apple's review process is notoriously slow and strict — and we're building an app for kids, which adds another layer of complexity.\nWe’ve seen horror stories of reviews taking 2–3 weeks… and with less than 2 weeks left in the hackathon, any major delay could mean launching too late. So we spent the day triple-checking every detail:\n✅ COPPA compliance documentation\n✅ Privacy Policy and Terms of Service\n✅ Contact and Support info\n✅ Landing page polish\n✅ App Store metadata\n✅ Minimal but functional MVP\nIf this first version gets through, we can start pushing updates using Expo EAS without needing to resubmit every time. That’s the plan.\n\nWe also made major strides in story generation costs! We’re down from $3.00 to ~80 cents per story — nearly a 4x improvement. We achieved this through:\nCode refactors\nSmarter API usage\nLeveraging more efficient model calls\nEvery cent matters when scaling a business. This optimization brings us closer to a viable pricing model post-hackathon.\nAfter exploring several options for consistent, personalized image generation (including custom pipelines, DreamBooth, etc.), the winner is still: OpenAI Image Gen v1.\nIt’s fast, consistent, takes direction better than anything else, and crucially — doesn’t require hours of training per user.\nFor our needs (1 photo → immediate image gen with likeness), nothing else competes right now.\nThe push continues. App store submission is out of our hands for now… so tomorrow, we keep building and improving what we can control.\nLet’s get this thing across the finish line.\n– Josh & Daniel\nStory Hero\n\nWhat is Story Hero?\n\nTwitter/X\n\nDEV Blog",

I therefore started a course in data science at LuxDev Academy, focusing primarily on data engineering.\nOver the past week, we focused on Excel as part of the introduction.

Over 11 million sites use GSAP and<br>\nGoogle recommends it for high-performance animations . Anime.js has good documentation as<br>\nwell, but a smaller community and fewer third-party tutorials. As one summary notes, GSAP is widely<br>\nadopted as an industry standard, while Anime.js is popular but with fewer learning resources .<br>\n• Size and Modularity: GSAP is modular – you can import only the parts you need (core + specific<br>\nplugins) to keep bundle size down. The core GSAP (3.x) is around 50KB (minified) , and plugins<br>\nadd more. Anime.js is smaller (the core is about 75KB minified) but it’s not split into plugins. For very<br>\nsimple animations where bundle size is critical, Anime.js’s overall smaller footprint can be an<br>\nadvantage.<br>\nWhen to choose which: In practice, use GSAP for large or complex animation projects (e.g. rich web apps,<br>\nparallax scrolling effects, interactive data visualizations) where performance and advanced control are<br>\ncrucial. Use Anime.js for simpler animations, prototypes, or projects where you want minimal setup and a<br>\nlightweight library. Both libraries are capable, but GSAP shines in “heavy-duty” scenarios and Anime.js is<br>\ngreat for quick, straightforward animations.<br>\n<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVOy9np8QOl6IHUkqc91t6ZcMgJRfoYb/view?usp=sharing\">To Read More Download this Book</a> </p>",

This technique helps to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between a client and a server and intercepts the SSL certificate, allowing them to read and modify the data being transmitted.\nIn SSL pinning, the client is pre-configured with the expected SSL certificate or public key of the server. When the client establishes a connection with the server, it verifies the server’s certificate against the expected certificate or public key. If the certificates match, the connection is established, otherwise, the connection is terminated.\nThis…",

You point it at a PNG or JPEG, and it spits out a wall of colored text that looks eerily close to the original image — all using braille, Unicode blocks, or ASCII characters.\nNaturally, I did what any curious dev would do:\n\nI fed it a few pictures, sat back, and watched my terminal become an art gallery.\nBut then I had a thought:\n\nWhat if you didn’t have to install anything?

In this post, I’ll show you how I built a simple and clean chat application using Node.js, Socket.IO, and a frontend built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript — no database required (at least for now 😉).\nNode.js + Express — backend server\nSocket.IO — real-time communication (WebSockets)\nHTML + CSS (Dark theme) — GitHub-like dark mode\nVanilla JavaScript — frontend logic\nUsers join a room by entering their name, and immediately join the live chat. Messages appear on the right for your own messages, and on the left for others. You’ll also see join/leave system notifications.\n/public\n  ├── index.html     # Join page (username input)\n  ├── chat.html      # Main chat interface\n  ├── styles.css     # Custom dark styling\n  └── script.js      # Handles socket and UI logic\n\nserver.js            # Node.js server + Socket.IO logic\n\nClone the repository:\n\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Mo-Ibra/simple-chat-app\ncd your-repo-name\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n\n\n\nnpm install\n\nStart the server:\n\n\n\n\nnode server.js\n\nOpen in browser:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\n\n✅ Real-time messaging between users\n✅ Notifications when users join/leave\n✅ Messages styled to indicate sender\n✅ Logout button that redirects to the join screen\n✅ No backend database needed for now (session-based)\nAt this stage, all messages are held temporarily in memory and disappear on refresh. In the future, you can easily plug in MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or any database to persist data.\nHere’s the GitHub repo:\n\n🔗 Mo-Ibra/simple-chat-app\nThis was a great exercise to understand WebSocket communication and Socket.IO in a very hands-on way. It’s perfect for beginners who want to get a feel for real-time apps.\nFeel free to fork the project, add new features like emojis, typing indicators, private messaging, or even a database backend!\nThanks for reading! ❤️\n\nIf you found this useful, give it a ❤️ or leave a comment below.",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\nLike many of you, I often work on several microservices at once. I found myself needing a straightforward way to centralize my application logs without the overhead of setting up a full ELK/EFK stack or paying for a third-party service, especially for smaller projects or internal tools.\nSo, I decided to build my own simple, two-part solution and I've just open-sourced it. I'm sharing it today in the hope that it might be useful to others and to get some feedback from this amazing community.\nThe solution consists of two separate projects:\nlog-sense-logback-appender\nThis is a custom Logback appender packaged as a Spring Boot starter. The idea is to make integration dead simple.\nWhat it does: It automatically hooks into your logging system and sends log events as structured JSON (including MDC properties and stack traces) to an HTTP endpoint.\nhttps://github.com/Wwf9w0/log-sense-logback-appender\nHere’s how easy the configuration is in any service you want to monitor:\nProperties\nlogsense.appender.enabled=true\nhttp://localhost:8080/api/logs\nlogsense-server\nThis is the other half of the duo. It’s a simple Spring Boot application that acts as the collector.\nWhat it does: It runs a lightweight server with a single REST endpoint (/api/logs) that listens for the JSON payloads sent by the appender.\nhttps://github.com/Wwf9w0/log-sense\nI'd love your feedback!\nWhat do you think of this approach for simple, centralized logging?\nAre there any obvious pitfalls or security concerns I might have overlooked?\nWhat features would you consider essential for a V2? (e.g., batching log sends, authentication, a simple query UI?)\nThanks for taking the time to check it out!",

We've moved beyond static prompt engineering into building AI agents, autonomous systems capable of reasoning, taking actions, using tools, and adapting to complex goals. These agents represent a major leap from traditional AI applications, requiring not just LLMs but orchestration, memory, and structured workflows.\nMost of this innovation has happened in the Python ecosystem, with tools like LangChain, AutoGen, and Semantic Kernel leading the way.

Durante meus estudos sobre EDA (Event Driven Architecture) ou Arquitetura orientada a eventos eu esbarrei com a sigla CQRS, que a gente acaba vendo com uma certa frequência em posts pela internet, então resolvi trazer um post dedicado a ela.\nA sigla CQRS significa Command Query Responsibility Segregation, que traduzindo para o português seria separação de responsabilidade de comando e consulta. De forma bem simples, o CQRS propõe separar as operações feitas pelo software entre comandos e consultas.\nVamos às definições, no contexto do CQRS um comando é toda operação que muda o estado, ou seja, update, delete, insert, qualquer comando de escrita. Enquanto uma consulta o nome diz por si só, é apenas uma consulta nos dados.\nÉ importa\nDe forma simples e direta você vai usar o CQRS para segregar comandos e consultas buscando desempenho, pois é comum aliado ao CQRS que você também tenha um banco apenas para consulta e um banco apenas para alterações ou comandos no caso. Porém não significa que ao usar CQRS você deve trabalhar com dois bancos de dados dessa forma.\nEsse texto ficou muito mais curto do que gostaria, porém, a explicação do que é CQRS é bem mais simples do que eu imaginava. Muito do conteúdo que achei usava CQRS e mais alguma coisa para explicar o mesmo o que acabava atrapalhando um pouco, a meu ver. Então gostaria de deixar esse texto direto e compacto, espero que tenha te ajudado!\nCQRS em 10 minutos // Dicionário do Programador\n\nO que é CQRS e quando utilizar?\n\n\n\n\n\nSe chegou até aqui, me segue la nas redes vizinhas.",

          "description": "Finding Peace in Effort: Lessons from the Bhagavad Gita on Overcoming Burnout and Anxiety\nHave you ever felt like you're giving your all, yet success remains elusive? The weight of expectations can feel crushing, leading to burnout and self-doubt.  The Bhagavad Gita, through the dialogue between Arjun and Krishna, offers a powerful antidote to this modern struggle.\nThe central teaching, \"You have the right to your actions, but never to their results,\" challenges our outcome-obsessed culture.

          "description": "Today, I began learning ReactJS, and it has already changed the way I think about building websites. React is modern, fast, and component-based. Below is a summary of the key concepts I explored today:\nReactJS is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces. It focuses on making UI development easy by breaking everything down into reusable components.\nA Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of app that:\nLoads only one HTML file initially.\n\nUpdates content dynamically without refreshing the entire page.\n\nThis makes navigation faster and provides a smoother user experience — and React is perfect for building SPAs.\nDOM (Document Object Model)\nThe DOM represents the structure of your HTML page. JavaScript can interact with and modify the DOM to update your content.\nVirtual DOM\nReact uses a Virtual DOM — a lightweight copy of the real DOM.\nWhen something changes in your app, React updates the Virtual DOM first.\n\nIt then compares it with the previous version (this is called diffing).\n\nOnly the parts that changed are updated in the real DOM.\n\nThis makes updates faster and more efficient.\nOne of the coolest things I learned today is JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML.\nJSX lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.\n\nIt makes React code more readable and easy to write.\n\nUnder the hood, JSX is converted to regular JavaScript using React.createElement().\n\nExample\nconst greeting = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;\n\nThis looks like HTML, but it’s actually JavaScript! You can also insert dynamic values using curly braces:\nconst name = \"John\";\nconst greeting = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n\nNPM(Node Package Manager)\nUsed to install libraries and manage project dependencies.\nNPX\nExample\nnpx create-react-app my-app\n\nThis command sets up a full React project instantly.",

Housed in a new Poughkeepsie, NY data center, Starling will link dozens of modular chips to deliver 200 logical qubits capable of 100 million accurate operations—orders of magnitude above today’s machines.\nThey’re banking on a newly cracked low-density parity-check error-correction code (12 physical qubits per logical qubit) plus real-time decoding on FPGAs to tame quantum glitches. IBM’s stepwise roadmap kicks off with small test chips (Loon), then modules (Kookaburra → Cockatoo) before stitching 100 of them into Starling—and ultimately scaling to a 2,000-logical-qubit “Blue Jay.” Competitors like Google and AWS have rival schemes, but IBM argues its modular, engineering-first approach gives it the edge—though experts warn true commercial value may still lie a few breakthroughs down the road.",

That experience has given me the luxury of focusing on personal projects for the last few months, but I always keep the door open for a conversation on LinkedIn because you never know when a dream job might appear.\nThis is what makes the recent trend of being ghosted on jobs I did not apply for so offensive. \nIn the last month alone, four recruiters reached out to me on LinkedIn(even though I did not apply for their vacancies), only to completely vanish after I sent my CV or asked for basic details about the role. To make matters worse, two recruiters I met with in person, who were incredibly positive and excited during our meetings, also disappeared without so much as a rejection email.\nI know this isn't just happening to me. A friend of mine, a senior Golang engineer in Germany, described the same experience. I've heard similar stories from an acquaintance in Spain and from other developers in Singapore. This seems to be a global issue.\nIt begs the question: Did AI and automation destroy professionalism in recruitment?\nWTF is going on? Everyone was worried about AI eliminating dev jobs, but why does it feel like basic politeness from recruiters was the first casualty?",

While it might seem like a behind-the-scenes tweak, it changed the way images are stored, shared, and opened across devices.\nHEIC stands for High Efficiency Image Coding, and it uses a newer compression method (based on HEVC, or H.265) that maintains image quality at a fraction of the file size.\nHEIC files are significantly smaller without sacrificing image quality. This means you can store thousands of high-res photos without eating up your iPhone's storage.\nFor people with 64GB or 128GB phones, this is a huge win.

Management can base their business decisions on Excel output data after analyzing sales trends, demand forecasts, and inventory levels for effective resource planning and utilization.\nSince beginning to learn Excel as a beginner, I have picked up on different features that are important when handling data. I will examine the three that have stuck out for me so far. These are:\n Conditional Formatting: \nConditional formatting reveals and highlights important values based on the users’ needs. These include values across a certain range, the top most and bottom values ina dataset and highlighting duplicate values.\n VLOOKUP: \nThis function helps one retrieve data by allowing you to search for a certain value in a table and returns the value in the desired column in the same row.\n IF Function: \nThis function enables one to extract only the desired data with conditions or criteria the data user has set. One must assign the value Excel returns if a condition is true and another value if it’s false.\nUsing Excel has enabled me to unpack different insights from data based on what I want to achieve.

          "description": "Discover How to Catch Critical Bugs in Your Smart Contracts Using Automated Testing in Foundry\n\n\nSmart contracts are the backbone of decentralized applications and, once deployed, they are publicly accessible. A single vulnerability can put an entire protocol at risk, potentially causing multi-million dollar losses. This is not theoretical, it has happened repeatedly in DeFi. One key reason is the open execution model of blockchain: anyone can call any function, with any parameter. That drastically increases the input space and the chance of bugs being triggered by unexpected or malicious inputs.\nTo build resilient smart contracts, we need to go beyond standard unit testing, and that's where fuzz testing comes in. In this article, you'll learn how to use fuzz testing and invariant checking…",

Moreover, you’ll understand why the LDR sensor full form and the LDR full form in electronics matter. We’ll break things down in simple terms so you get the full picture.\nAn LDR sensor, or Light Dependent Resistor, is a light‑sensitive device that changes its electrical resistance based on how much light hits it. When light shines on it, its resistance drops. However, in the darkness, resistance increases. That’s why it’s also called a photoresistor.\n\nThe LDR full form is Light Dependent Resistor. In electronics, this LDR refers to a resistor that is governed by light levels—its resistance depends on the intensity of light. That makes the LDR sensor a simple but effective sensor for detecting b…",

          "description": "In the fast-moving world of digital marketing, your email list is one of your most valuable assets. But if you're sending campaigns that bounce, get ignored, or land in spam folders — you're not only wasting money, you're also hurting your sender reputation. Fortunately, there's one powerful fix that can help: email list cleaning with the right email verification tool.\nWhen an email can't reach its intended recipient, it \"bounces\" back. These failures fall into two main categories:\nHard bounces: These occur when an email address is invalid, doesn’t exist, or is entered incorrectly. These are permanent failures.\nSoft bounces: These are temporary delivery issues — like a full inbox, a slow or busy mail server, or emails that exceed size limits.\n\nThe fastest way to reduce email bounce rates? Clean your email list before every campaign.\nMarketers who clean their lists regularly report:\nIf you're looking for a fast, reliable, and affordable solution, look no further than Bouncify.\n\n💡 Stop letting bounce rates steal your results. Clean your list. Reach real people. Grow faster — with Bouncify.",

In other words, state is a dynamic data storage that provides a mechanism for components to manage, keep track of changing data, and trigger re-rendering when it is updated.\nState management is like the brain of your app. It remembers everything the app needs to know at any moment — such as what you've typed in a form, whether you're signed in, or what screen you're looking at. When something changes (like you click a button), state management updates that memory and tells the app to show the ri…",

          "description": "Last week, I ran into one of those annoying little tech moments.\nI was away from my usual setup, working on a basic office desktop with no Microsoft Office installed. Someone sent me an Excel (.xlsx) file over Slack, and all I needed was to quickly check a few numbers—nothing more.\nNormally, I’d upload it to Google Sheets, but the network had strange restrictions that blocked uploads. Logging into accounts on a shared machine didn’t feel right, and installing new software wasn’t an option.\nAfter clicking through a few sketchy “free viewers,” I finally found a tool that just worked. You upload the file (or paste a URL), and it renders your spreadsheet directly in the browser—no ads, no sign-ins, no remote uploads. Everything runs locally, and your document never leaves your device. Fast, clean, and effortless.\nEven better, it comes with some really thoughtful features:\n✅ View Excel spreadsheets without needing Microsoft Excel or Office 365\n✅ Navigate between multiple sheets with ease\n✅ No registration or login required\n✅ Files are processed privately, entirely within your browser\n✅ Simple drag-and-drop upload\n✅ Fullscreen viewing mode for better readability\nIf you ever find yourself in the same situation, you can try it here.\nNot flashy, but it saved me time and frustration. If you know other minimalist tools like this that just work, drop them in the comments—I’d love to check them out.",

If there's one thing that kept me up at night in my early days, it was consensus algorithms. Not because they're impossibly complex, but because choosing the wrong one can absolutely wreck your system's performance and reliability.\nLet me save you some sleepless nights by breaking down what I wish someone had told me when I was designing systems that needed to handle 50K+ events per second with zero tolerance for inconsistency.\nPicture this: you have multiple servers that need to agree on something.

          "description": "Security is a crucial aspect of web development, and while much of the focus is often on backend protections, HTML itself offers several ways to enhance security. Here are five HTML tips to help you build a more secure website.  \n1. Use `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" for External Links\n\n\nWhen using target=\"_blank\" on anchor (<a>) tags, always include rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" to prevent security risks like reverse tabnapping.  \nhtml\n\n\nThis prevents the new page from accessing the window.opener property of your site, reducing the risk of malicious attacks.  \n2. Sanitize User Input with sandbox in <iframe>\n\n\nIf your site embeds third-party content using <iframe>, always use the sandbox attribute to restrict what the embedded content can do.  \n`html\n`\n\nThis prevents actions like form submissions, pop-ups, and script execution unless explicitly allowed.  \n3. Enable HTTPS with <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\">\n\n\nUse the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) meta tag to enforce secure connections and prevent mixed content issues.  \nhtml\n\n\nThis automatically upgrades HTTP requests to HTTPS, reducing man-in-the-middle attack risks.  \n4. Prevent Form Hijacking with SameSite Cookies\n\n\nWhile primarily a backend setting, you can help secure forms by ensuring cookies are marked as SameSite (handled via server headers). However, you can reinforce security by using:  \n`html\n`\n\nAvoid GET for sensitive data, as it exposes parameters in the URL.  \n5. Disable Autofill on Sensitive Fields\n\n\nFor fields that should not be stored in the browser (e.g., one-time passwords, security codes), disable autocomplete:  \nhtml\n\n\nThis prevents browsers from storing sensitive information that could be exploited.  \nFinal Thoughts\n\n\nWhile HTML alone won’t make your site completely secure, these practices add an extra layer of protection. Combine them with proper backend security (like input validation, CSRF tokens, and HTTPS) for a robust defense.",

They are more interested in how it can allow them to change their lifestyle. They may care about the higher pay, allowing for a better living space, or to get away from the work culture they are used to in a different industry, or the aspect of being able to work remotely. You’ll often hear people from this group say something like “I just want to be able to travel and work from anywhere”. Hence the name “tourist”.

You, as an observer, notice certain groups forming naturally: a cluster of people engrossed in a lively conversation, another huddled around a board game, and a quieter group enjoying the music. You haven't assigned anyone to a group; the groups emerged organically based on shared behaviours and interests. This natural grouping is the essence of unsupervised learning, specifically clustering.\nUnsupervised learning is a powerful branch of machine learning where algorithms learn from unlabeled data—data without predefined categories or targets. Unlike supervised learning, which uses labeled data to make predictions (e.g., classifying emails as spam or not spam), unsupervised learning aims to uncover hidden patterns, structures, and relationships within t…",

This one mixes frequency parity, substring windows, and greedy insight. Let’s break it down and crack it open. 💡\nGiven a string s consisting of digits '0' to '4', and an integer k, your task is to find the maximum difference freq[a] - freq[b] in a substring of s of size at least k, where:\nCharacter a has an odd frequency.\nCharacter b has an even frequency.\nYou can pick any substring and any two characters (a ≠ b).

Under Projects, it currently shows only ARLIZ—my ongoing book on arrays, logic, identity, and zero (a journey through DS&A from first principles to real-world code).

If you see any typos, missing links, or broken demos, feel free to open an Issue or send a PR—I’d love your help squashing bugs, improving content, or even adding entirely new sections.\nIf you enjoyed poking around, please ⭐ the repo and drop your thoughts, suggestions, or criticisms in the Issues.

Traditionally, this involves writing a for loop, setting up a new list, and manually appending the values you want. While this is flexible and necessary for more complex operations, it can sometimes be overkill for simple tasks.\nList comprehension offers a cleaner, more concise way to write these operations. Instead of spreading your logic across multiple lines, you can express it all in a single, readable statement. Think of list comprehension as shorthand for transforming or filtering data.

Under Projects, it currently shows only ARLIZ—my ongoing book on arrays, logic, identity, and zero (a journey through DS&A from first principles to real-world code).

If you see any typos, missing links, or broken demos, feel free to open an Issue or send a PR—I’d love your help squashing bugs, improving content, or even adding entirely new sections.\nIf you enjoyed poking around, please ⭐ the repo and drop your thoughts, suggestions, or criticisms in the Issues.

Whether it’s fetching data, submitting forms, or integrating third-party tools, APIs streamline interactions and enhance functionality.\nHowever, managing APIs efficiently requires an API Gateway, a control point that sits between clients and backend services. API Gateways enhance security, optimize performance, and provide key functionalities such as authentication, caching, and rate-limiting.\nThink of an API Gateway as a traffic controller, it ensures that requests are routed properly, prevents unnecessary load on backend systems, and maintains smooth interactions between users and applications.\nOptimizing API performance is crucial for scalability and reliability.

I’ve worked with companies in Brazil and the U.S. — especially on projects where technology and creativity meet.\nRecently, I came across the concept of AI Citation SEO, and it immediately resonated with me. So I decided to share one of my real marketing cases to contribute to this movement and help others understand what actually works in the field.\nIn 2023, I joined a project involving an AI-generated music platform. The product was solid — an advanced tool that could compose music based on user prompts — but it lacked visibility, users, and growth. The challenge? Turn powerful tech into real traction.\nI designed and executed a multi-platform growth strategy, with a strong focus on testing and fast iteration.\nHere’s what I actually did:\nMeta + Google Ads: Built and optimized full-funnel paid campaigns.\nWhat this project taught me is simple: real growth doesn’t come from hype — it comes from understanding your audience, testing relentlessly, and building systems that scale.\nFlashy tools and buzzwords can’t replace thoughtful strategy.\nIt also reinforced how important it is to document and share real, measurable results — not vanity metrics or vague claims.\nBy publishing transparent case studies like this one, I aim to contribute to a more honest and inclusive digital ecosystem.\nLanguage models like ChatGPT and Perplexity are starting to recognize and recommend professionals based on factual credibility, not popularity alone.\nWe need a new kind of visibility — one built on evidence, not ego.\nIf you’re curious about this approach — or want to explore AI Citation Growth for your own brand or career — feel free to follow me or leave a comment.\nI’ll be sharing more real-world cases and strategies soon.\nLet’s build visibility that lasts.",

Then we claimed our free custom domain using Entri (IONOS) — and just like that, Story Hero was live.\nIt’s:\n🔄 Responsive & mobile-friendly\n💫 Full of subtle animations\n🔍 SEO-optimized with OG metadata\n📬 Equipped with an email waitlist signup\nHonestly, it turned out beautiful and exceeded our expectations — and it’s already helping us tell the Story Hero story to the world.\n\nWe also whipped up our first draft of App Store screenshots. They’re rough, but they’re enough to help us push towards our next big milestone: getting the app submitted for App Store review ASAP.\n\nThe review process can take time (and surprises happen), so our focus is to get a \"good enough\" build live fast, then iterate from there. The sooner we get it into Apple’s hands, the sooner we can get real users and even paying subscribers — all before the hackathon ends.\nThis week’s progress gets us one step closer to the goal: launching a real product with paying users in just 30 days. We’re still going for the “Make More Money” challenge, and every decision is focused on that north star.\nEven if we don’t win a prize, building Story Hero alongside this community is already worth it.

This reduces administrative work and helps attorneys begin each case with clearer context.\nRisk Detection and Compliance AI tools can now analyze estate documents for errors, inconsistencies, or missing provisions.

          "description": "AWS continues to expand its offer of resource visibility with enhanced security. The newest addition to the arsenal is the integration between AWS Resource Explorer and AWS PrivateLink, now available in all commercial regions. This move marks an important step for organizations that need to locate resources broadly, but without giving up private traffic, especially in environments with tighter security restrictions.\nResource Explorer alone represents a breakthrough in the way administrators view their resources spread across different accounts and regions. Now, with support for PrivateLink, this capability can be achieved within the scope of VPC, without the need to expose calls to the public Internet.\nThis type of evolution addresses a sensitive point in multi-account architectures: how to ensure that distributed teams have visibility over the environment without compromising private connectivity standards? The new integration solves precisely this dilemma. It enables broad searches for resources using the Console, CLI, or SDKs, all encapsulated within the private VPC fabric.\nIn practice, this means that it is possible to consult resources on an organizational scale, with enhanced security and without relying on public routes. The experience is still accessible via the unified search bar, which maintains operational fluidity even in environments with tighter governance.\nThe big advantage here is not just in the discovery itself, but in the way this discovery is made. By keeping traffic within the PrivateLink domain, the risk of exposing sensitive metadata and API calls is drastically reduced. This control is essential for companies that need to meet more demanding compliance requirements, especially in sectors such as finance, healthcare, or government.\nWith this update, Resource Explorer takes another leap towards becoming not just an inventory tool, but a central point of contextual visibility, and now more compatible with corporate security policies.\nI hope you enjoyed it!

In this article, we will explore the most common causes of this error and, most importantly, how to fix it so you can get back to development without any more issues.\nThis happens due to the PowerShell execution policy settings. Here is a step-by-step guide to resolve the problem:\n1- Open PowerShell as Administrator:\n● Search for \"PowerShell\" in the Start menu.\n● Right-click on \"Windows PowerShell\" and select \"Run as administrator.\"\n2-Change the Execution Policy:\nIn PowerShell, type the following command to allow the execution of scripts:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n\nPress \"Enter\" and, when prompted, type \"Y\" to confirm the change.\n3- Check the Execution Policy:\nTo make sure the change was applied correctly, run the following command:\nGet-ExecutionPolicy\n\nIt should return the RemoteSigned policy, which allows local scripts and remote scripts that are signed to run.\n4- Run the npm install Command Again:\nNow, you can try running the command again:\nnpm create vite@latest\n\nThis should resolve the script-blocking issue and allow the installation to complete successfully.\nReverting to the Default Policy (Optional):\nIf you prefer to revert the execution policy to the more secure default after the installation, just run the following command:\n⚠️ Important: Always be cautious when changing the execution policy. Only run scripts from trusted sources. To revert to the default policy, use the following command:\n🚨 The last command npm create vite@latest is only needed if you are using vite.\nSource:\nLink",

Neste artigo, vamos explorar as causas mais frequentes desse erro e, o mais importante, como corrigi-lo para que você possa voltar ao desenvolvimento sem mais problemas.\nIsso acontece devido às configurações de política de execução do PowerShell. Aqui está um guia passo a passo para resolver o problema:\nAbra o PowerShell como Administrador:\n● Pesquise por \"PowerShell\" no menu Iniciar.\n● Clique com o botão direito em \"Windows PowerShell\" e selecione \"Executar como administrador\".\nAltere a Política de Execução:\nNo PowerShell, digite o seguinte comando para permitir a execução de scripts:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n\nPressione \"Enter\" e, quando solicitado, digite \"Y\" para confirmar a alteração.\nVerifique a Política de Execução:\nPara garantir que a alteração foi feita corretamente, execute o comando:\nGet-ExecutionPolicy\n\nEle deve retornar a política RemoteSigned, que permite a execução de scripts locais e de scripts remotos que sejam assinados.\nExecute o Comando npm installNovamente:\nAgora, você pode tentar rodar o comando novamente:\nnpm create vite@latest\n\n\nIsso deve resolver o problema de bloqueio de scripts e permitir que a instalação seja concluída com sucesso.\nRevertendo para a Política Padrão (Opcional):\nSe você preferir reverter a política de execução para o padrão de segurança mais rígido após a instalação, basta rodar o comando:\n⚠️ Importante: Sempre tenha cuidado ao alterar a política de execução. Execute apenas scripts de fontes confiáveis.

This guide covers everything from kube-proxy internals to service misconfigurations and observability.\nClusterIP is the default service type in Kubernetes. It enables intra-cluster communication by exposing a virtual IP address that distributes traffic to backend pods.\nBut when things break in production, understanding how ClusterIP works internally is essential to resolving outages fast. This guide walks you through the ClusterIP traffic flow, and shares two real-world production issues, including how they were detected and fixed.\nHow ClusterIP Services Route Traffic Internally\n\n\nHere’s the step-by-step path of a packet routed through a ClusterIP:\n1.

For that reason, working on plotting isn't exciting - but not having it can be really annoying.\nThe goal of the plotting API in Divooka is to provide a very high-level, easy-to-use (ideally single-node) setup for common plot types: you just supply the source data, pick the plot type, behold and voila - you get the resulting chart. In the case of the Plotting toolbox, the results are static images.\n\nThis scheme allows some fairly complex plot types, as seen here:\n\nHowever, things can become tricky when we want to support advanced style configurations, for which the convention is to expose data on a node as direct inputs and style configurations as a separate Configurations input, as discussed in this b…",

It felt dry and technical, like a digital notebook without much purpose.\nBut once I began learning data analysis, I quickly realized Excel is far more than a basic spreadsheet tool. It's one of the most accessible and powerful platforms for working with data — especially when you're just starting out.\nSo, What Is Excel Really?\nIt’s part calculator, part notebook, part detective. And with just a few key skills, Excel becomes your go-to tool for understanding what your data is really saying.\n💼 Real-World Uses of Excel in Data Analysis\nHR Analytics: Understanding People Through Data\nHR teams do more than just handle hiring paperwork. They use data to improve employee experiences and workplace performance.\nExample:\nExample:\nHealthcare Data: Improving Efficiency\nWhile Excel doesn’t replace hospital systems, it’s incredibly useful for managing non-sensitive healthcare data like appointments, staff schedules, or treatment plans.\nExample:\n🔍 Excel Features I’ve Come to Love\nVLOOKUP: A lifesaver when combining datasets. I’ve used it to match product names with IDs or to connect survey results with demographic info.\nConditional Formatting: This makes patterns jump off the page — like highlighting overdue tasks, duplicate entries, or high scores.\nIF Statements: Great for applying logic and flagging data — for example, labeling rows as “Pass” or “Fail” based on a score.\n💭 How Excel Changed the Way I See Data\nBut now? I see data as a conversation.\nWhen I open a dataset, I instinctively ask:\nMore importantly, Excel has made me more careful. I’ve learned to look twice before jumping to conclusions, and I’ve gained a deep appreciation for how a simple tool can surface powerful insights.",

For example, to access the first element in a List, you retrieve the value at index 0, which is predictable due to the ordered nature of Lists.\nHowever, when the order of data is not important, a Dictionary (or key-value store) is more suitable. Consider a scenario where you need to store user information like age, address, first name, and last name. In this case, the sequence of these fields doesn’t matter. With a Dictionary, you can directly access a specific value using its key, such as retrieving the first name by querying the \"first_name\" key, without needing to know the last name or other fields.\nKey differences:\nIn a List, values are stored with predefined, sequential indices (0, 1, 2, ...), and you access data by its position.\nIn a Dictionary, you define custom keys mapped to values, allowing direct access to data via the key, regardless of order.\nThus, for scenarios where you need flexible, key-based access to data without relying on order, a Dictionary is the preferred choice.\nCoffee Menu in Python — Dictionary Operations\nCreating a Coffee Menu (Dictionary)\nprint(coffee_menu)\nAccessing a Value (Using Key)\nprint(coffee_menu['Espresso'])\nOutput:\nBold shot!\nChanging a Value\n\ncoffee_menu['Espresso'] = 'Tiny Thunder'\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nIterating Over the Dictionary\nOnly Keys\nOutput:\nKeys and Values (Method 1)\nKeys and Values (Method 2)\nAdding an Item\nRemoving Items\n\n\n\n\nUsing pop(key)\n\ncoffee_menu.pop('Espresso')\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nUsing popitem()\nRemoves the last inserted item.\nExample Output:\n⚠️ Note: If the dictionary is empty, popitem() will raise a KeyError.\nUsing del Statement\n\ndel coffee_menu[\"Latte\"]\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\n📝 Note:\nEach operation was done individually for demonstration, so dictionary contents might look different in each output.

If you've been following this series, you'd know that installing a library in C++ is as hard as a wooden stick. It won't build until I RECONFIGURE THE WHOLE SH*T FROM GROUND UP.\nAnyways, after the reconfigure, I saw some weird decisions I had made throughout the whole process like why did I use FetchContent to download the libraries on the fly when I had already put them in my source folder. I could've just included the subdirectory at the build time.\nAt this point I realised a basic rule of programming:\nand then I ignored all of it and went ahead to read the documentation of zlib. I am currently reading this and I hope it is at least half if not as completely easy as the JSON one.\nThat's all for today guys, will catch you tomorrow when I bring updates about this library.\nTill then Bye 🫡",

You’re not alone.\nThis post is a summarized version of a full guide by Daniel Daines-Hutt over at Zero To Mastery, where he breaks down whether tech is worth it, what the path actually looks like, and how to get started from scratch.\nOne of the biggest advantages in tech? You don’t need a college degree to get hired. Companies care more about your skills and whether you can do the job, not where you learned it.\nThat’s why most people learn through platforms like YouTube, online courses, or bootcamps. And the costs are a fraction of a university degree. For example, Zero To Mastery students have gotten hired at FAANG companies after just 5–9 months of focused self-study.\nYou can literally start learning the skills…",

          "description": "Java handles memory management differently for static and instance variables. Static variables are stored in the method area and belong to the class, meaning they are shared among all instances. They are loaded into memory only once when the class is first loaded. In contrast, instance variables are stored in the heap and are unique to each object, getting created each time an object is instantiated. This clear separation helps Java manage memory efficiently and reduces redundancy. Understanding this distinction is vital for writing optimized programs.

          "description": "While Solana has long been celebrated for its impressive base-layer performance, processing thousands of transactions per second, the blockchain landscape of 2025 demands even greater scalability. The emergence of sophisticated Layer 2 solutions marks a pivotal evolution in Solana’s architecture, challenging the conventional wisdom that high-performance chains don’t need additional scaling layers.\nThis transformation comes as Solana has secured its position as the second-largest blockchain by Total Value Locked (TVL), trailing only Ethereum. The integration of Layer 2 protocols isn’t just about increasing transaction throughput — it’s about creating specialized processing environments that cater to specific use cases while maintaining the network’s core advantages.\nCurrent Solana Layer 2 L…",

The default access modifier is public. Using appropriate access modifiers can enhance code security and readability. Note that if a class contains private properties, the class cannot be initialized using object literals.\n\n\nNegative Example:\n\n\n\n\nclass C {\n  count: number = 0;\n\n  getCount(): number {\n    return this.count;\n  }\n}\n\nPositive Example:\n\n\n\n\nclass C {\n  private count: number = 0;\n\n  public getCount(): number {\n    return this.count;\n  }\n}\n\nLevel: Recommendation\nDescription: In ArkTS, floating - point values include a decimal point, but there is no requirement for a digit before or after the decimal point.

Now, it sits inside phone screens, captured but rarely noticed.\nWe track its orbit with precision, but when was the last time we truly saw it? Not through a lens. Not for a post. Just looked up and listened.\nTechnology gives us more ways to observe, but observation is not meaning. Some symbols endure, even as their relevance fades. The moon waits, rising without applause, reflecting light without demand.\nMaybe it still belongs to strangers. Maybe that is what keeps it alive.\nRead full article here",

It helps control the rate of function calls, ensuring that performance-intensive operations — such as server requests — don’t trigger excessively as users interact with the UI. A classic example is a search bar: as the user types, the application waits until they’ve paused before sending a request to fetch matching results. Another familiar case is an autocomplete panel, where each keystroke could theoretically initiate a query — but shouldn’t.\nIn Angular applications, especially those using the new reactive primitives introduced with Signals, developers often ask: “How do I debounce a signal?” At first glance, this might seem like a natural extension of reac…",

With just a little focused daily training, you can dramatically boost your typing speed and accuracy, unlocking a faster, smoother workflow.\nLike any speed measurement unit, KPH or MPH for example, it's basically how many words you can type in a minute. According to a survey done in March 2025 by onlinetyping.org on 56,000 volunteers, 28…",

Instead, it offers a deceptively simple, yet profound mechanism: explicit error checking.

Clean code is readable, maintainable, and easier to debug, saving time and headaches for you and your team. Here are a few tips to level up your code quality:\nUse Meaningful Names: Variable names like x or temp are cryptic. Instead, use descriptive names like userProfile or requestTimeout to make your code self-documenting.\nKeep Functions Small: A function should do one thing and do it well. If your function is sprawling across dozens of lines, break it into smaller, focused functions.\nComment Wisely: Avoid redundant comments like // increments i. Instead, explain why the code exists, e.g., // Ensures thread safety during parallel requests.\nFollow Consistent Formatting: Use tools like Prettier or ESLint to enforce consistent style. It’s not just aesthetics—it reduces cognitive load when others read your code.\nRefactor Regularly: Don’t let technical debt pile up. Refactor as you go to keep your codebase healthy and adaptable.\nWriting clean code isn’t just about today’s sprint—it’s about building software that’s easier to extend and maintain in the long run.

          "description": "Traditional RAG systems typically follow a linear approach: retrieve documents, generate a response, and present it to the user. While effective, this approach can lack the nuanced understanding and specialized processing that complex queries often require. In contrast, AI agents introduce a more dynamic and intelligent workflow to RAG-based operations. They can collaborate, iterate, and critique each other’s outputs, enabling deeper understanding and more coherent responses. This agent-driven approach transforms RAG from a static process into an adaptive system capable of producing higher-quality, context-aware content.\nIn this blog post, we’ll guide you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the database, CrewAI for agent-based Retrieval-Augmented Generatio…",

This lets Spring Boot apps run as fast and light as Quarkus, without having to change to a different framework.\nIn this article, I’ll explain what native compilation means, how it works, and why it makes a big difference for modern applications like microservices and serverless functions.\nTraditional Java Compilation (JVM-B…",

I'm not sure how this works but it said I could make a first post so here goes:\nHow are you all doing? \nI joined this community (which looks awesome btw) in the hopes of learning more in regards to coding. I have some basic knowledge of coding languages like Python and HTML and have taken part in a hackathon once upon a time. \nAlthough I havent made any projects recently and I think thats something I need to work on so I'm going to try my best to do more of that. \nIf you have a project that you're working on and dont mind someone with little to no experience in coding, do let me know. As what I lack in experience I make up for in enthusiasm, words of encouragement and memes. Hopefully if you do let me join your team we get some sort of work done. In all seriousness I plan on getting better at coding so I'll have more to offer. Also if you require a video editor, I am very confident in my video editing capabilities and have made a video for a Star Wars hackathon which I took part in last year (I'll put the video in my next post).\nCurrently I'm self-studying Harvards CS50 intro to computer science and its very interesting. I hope to learn more and grow with you all. Thanks for making this community.\nP.S I'm a huge Naruto fan (hence my cover image/gif), its a topic I'm extremely knowledgeable about but unfortunately cant add to my CV. Maybe I'll make a Naruto inspired website one day😅",

Let's take a journey through the three eras of the web and explore what makes Web3 so revolutionary.\nBefore diving into the web evolution, here's a fun fact: the internet was born from Cold War paranoia!\nIn the 1960s, the U.S. Department of Defense's ARPA created ARPANET — a communication network designed to survive nuclear attacks. The irony? What started as a military defense system became the foundation for cat videos and memes.\n💡 Did you know? The first ARPANET message was sent on October 29, 1969, between UCLA and Stanford. It was supposed to say \"LOGIN\" but crashed after \"LO\" — technically making the first internet message failed attempt!\nTimeline: Early 1990s - 2004\nCore Traits: Read-only, …",

O DNS converte os nomes de domínio (legíveis por humanos, como www.google.com) em endereços IP (que os computadores usam para se comunicar).\nCada dispositivo conectado à Internet tem um IP único que as outras máquinas usam para localizar o dispositivo.

By examining nine prehistoric sites (1.8–0.8 Mya) worldwide—each rich in big-game bones—and ethnographic parallels, they show that the enormous caloric payoff of preserved mega-meat justified the effort of collecting and tending fires.  \nOnce fire was routinely available for preservation, roasting foods (evidenced by fish bones ~800 kya) would’ve been a no-brainer “bonus.” This fresh take, published in Frontiers in Nutrition, slots neatly into the duo’s broader theory that early humans’ behaviors largely revolved around hunting large animals and adapting as their sizes—and availability—waned.",

I chose the latter. That’s how I stumbled into setting up Neovim.\nIf you don’t know what Neovim is… well, don’t worry, you’re probably happier that way. But if you’re curious (or just here for the chaos), let me walk you through how I went from zero to semi-obsessed with a glorified terminal text editor.\nSo here’s the thing — I recently started learning Go (aka Golang, aka \"Google’s gift to minimalists\"), and while going through a couple of tutorials, I noticed som…",

If you've ever been confused by CORS errors or struggled to implement CORS correctly, this resource is for you.\nUnderstanding CORS headers is essential for modern web development, but the official documentation can be overwhelming and scattered. Many developers know they need to set CORS headers but aren't sure which ones to use or how they work together. CORS Headers Explained aims to simplify this by providing a clear, structured guide to every CORS header you need to know.\nOur resource covers every CORS header you need to know:\nComplete Header Reference: Explanations of all CORS headers including Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, and more.\nPractical Code Examples: Implementations examples for server and client-side code for every header.\nCommon Error Solutions: Clear solutions for errors and fixes for the most frequent CORS issues.\nEach header page includes syntax examples, usage examples, common error solutions, and related headers to help you understand how everything fits together.\nWhether you're setting up CORS for the first time, debugging a tricky preflight request, or need to understand what each header does, CORS Headers Explained is your go-to reference. It's perfect for both beginners learning CORS fundamentals and experienced developers who need quick answers.\nVisit CORS Headers Explained!\nSource code is available on GitHub.",

This eighth post introduces you to Perl regular expressions in XS.\nWe should all know what a regular expression is?\nBut if you don’t, here’s a quick refresher: A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. They can be used for string matching, searching, and manipulation. Regular expressions are widely used in programming languages, including Perl, to perform complex text processing tasks.\nIn Perl regular expressions can be precompiled and executed using the 'qr//' operator, which allows you to create a regex object that can be reused multiple times. This is particularly useful for performance when the same regex is used re…",

(Confession: I still don’t know what hedge funds do.)\nBut in the world of sustainability, “net-zero” means balancing the greenhouse gases we produce with the amount we remove from the atmosphere.\nTranslation? Try not to fry the planet like a cheap microwave burrito.\nSo where do smart building technologies come in? Oh, buckle up—it’s about to get high-tech and surprisingly personal.\nA few years ago, I was managing an old office building. Flickering lights. Groaning HVAC.

It validates data by comparing aggregate metrics, schema metadata, duplicate & null counts, and other statistics between two data sources (i.e., source and target). The system is designed to be modular, configurable, and extensible.\nKey features include:  \nMapping CSV Input: Users supply a CSV file that defines which source and target tables (or queries) to compare.\n\n\nFlexible Data Source Configuration: You can pass a fully qualified object name (e.g., db.schema.object_name) or a custom SQL query (or file path ending with .sql) for both source and target.

Today, I want to share some insights about writing cleaner, self-documenting code.\nWhy Im so down on comments? Because they lie. Not always, not intentionally but too often. The older the comment is the more likely it is to be wrong. The reason is software engineers maintain the code but not the comments. Code will not lie to you but comment will; Code evolves but comments not. Thus comments sometimes will be misleading.\nTherefore although comments are sometimes necessary, we need to try to minumise them.\nOne of the common motivation for comments is bad code.

It accounts for a significant portion of daily keystrokes—nearly 1 in every 5, according to TypingMetrics' 2023 report. For decades, however, this most-used key remained bland: unmarked, uncolored, and unconsidered in custom builds.\nBut that’s changing.

          "description": "Introduction\n\n\nIf we’re going to talk about max width, let’s define it properly first. The max-width CSS property sets the maximum width of an element. It prevents the width of that element (and its content) from exceeding a specific value, even if there's more space available.\nIn today’s digital world, we’re building for a wide range of screen sizes—phones, tablets, laptops, desktops. As web developers, we’re expected to make sites look good and work well across all of them. This is where max-width becomes a crucial part of your responsive layout toolbox.\nIf you’ve ever zoomed in or out in your browser or used developer tools to simulate different screen sizes, you’ve seen how your layout can break when it's not properly handled. It’s easy to unknowingly design just for your own screen, but once you start testing, the need for max-width becomes clear fast.\nMedia queries let you adjust layout styles at different screen widths (often using min-width), but they’re only part of the picture. Max-width ensures your layout doesn’t stretch too far on large screens, helping maintain visual balance and readability.",

          "description": "In modern software architecture, real-time communication between systems is a necessity. And Webhooks have appeared as a simple and effective method for applications to get updated information from other services instantly. In event-driven systems, it's more important due to the need of responsiveness and automation.\n\nA webhook is used to send information from one system to another, in real time, as soon as a particular event happens. Rather than checking with an API at certain times, a webhook allows the source system to send data right away to a predetermined location.\nFor instance, you can use a webhook from Stripe so your application is informed when a payment is successful or unsuccessful. Thanks to this, you can make updates in real time to the order status, send emails or retry logi…",

However, it can get a little complicated when our agents perform complex workflows. Our agents could perform numerous executions, making it difficult to track decisions made by all or them, or some agents may invoke tools, that invoke other tools, which invoke more tools! (And so on and so forth).\nTracing our agents helps us see the inputs and outputs involved in a particular agent run, as well as the order in which those agents were invoked.

If you're running different types of runners (like 4-core, 8-core, or more), those minutes aren't equal, and your total usage number doesn't reflect it.\nThis guide will show you how to:\nExport your raw usage data\nNormalize it by runner type\nGet an accurate total you can actually budget against \\\nWhy normalizing GitHub Actions minutes matters\n\n\nRunner types in GitHub Actions have different compute capacities and costs. For example, a 4-core runner can do twice the work of a 2-core runner. If you just sum the raw usage, you're underestimating your real consumption and leaving yourself open to surprise bills.\nStep 1: Export your usage report\n\n\n\nIn GitHub, click your avatar (top right) and go to Settings\n\nSelect Billing and plans\n\nUnder Usage this month, click Get usage report\n\nChoose your date range (30/60/90 days) and download the CSV\nYou'll now have a CSV showing runner types, quantities, and costs.\nStep 2: Normalize your minutes\n\n\nOpen the CSV in any spreadsheet tool. Focus on the 'sku' and 'quantity' columns. Each runner type has a multiplier based on its compute capacity:\n\n\n\nRunner Type\nMultiplier\n\n\n\n\nactions_linux\n1\n\n\nactions_linux_4_core\n2\n\n\nactions_linux_8_core\n4\n\n\nactions_linux_16_core\n8\n\n\nactions_linux_32_core\n16\n\n\n\nTo normalize your total usage:\nFor each runner type, multiply the quantity by the multiplier\nSum these normalized values across all runner types\nThis gives you the total compute-equivalent minutes your team used during the period.\nStep 3: Use the data to control costs\n\n\nWithout normalized data, you're likely underestimating usage. This normalization process gives you a real number to track, budget against, and compare over time.\nTake it further with Depot\n\n\nOnce you know how many minutes you're actually burning, the next step is cutting them down. Depot Runners can dramatically speed up your CI builds, reducing both time and cost.\nIf you're ready to stop guessing and start saving, give Depot a try.",

Initially, I attempted to make ROS2 work on Oracle Linux, expecting a straightforward integration. However, after several days of troubleshooting and configuration tweaks, I was still encountering persistent issues.\nNext, I shifted my focus to using SELinux on Ubuntu. Unfortunately, this too presented complications that weren't worth resolving at the time. Although both SELinux and Oracle Linux theoretically support ROS2, the practical reality was too time-consuming to justify.

That's KMSPico — a neat little tool that uses corporate licensing logic to activate software on individual machines.\nMicrosoft introduced the KMS system for volume licensing. It was never intended for individuals.

I’m confused—there’s chaos around GenAI everywhere. Should I start with GenAI, or go back to the development work (MEAN stack) I used to do?\nDue to workload, I could never study consistently for either. \nI’ve introspected a lot, and I’m still confused. My current job only pays well, but the work is completely disconnected from my career aspirations.\nPlease share your comments, suggestions, and advice.\nNote - I graduated in 2023 with < 2 YOE.",

Whether you’re a beginner or updating your skills, here’s a step-by-step guide to get your SwiftUI app up and running.\nInstall the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store (Xcode 15 or newer).\nMake sure your macOS is updated to support the latest Xcode.\nFamiliarize yourself with the Swift 5.9+ language features introduced recently.\nOpen Xcode and choose \"Create a new Xcode project.\"\nSelect \"App\" under the iOS tab.\nName your project (e.g., SwiftShelfApp).\nEnsure \"Swift\" is selected as the language and \"SwiftUI\" as the interface.\nThe main entry point is marked with the @main attribute.\nYour ContentView.swift uses SwiftUI’s declarative syntax.\nLearn the basic building blocks like View, State, Binding, and ObservableObject.\nStart by modifying ContentView.swift:\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var counter = 0\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing: 20) {\n            Text(\"Welcome to SwiftShelf!\")\n                .font(.title)\n                .padding()\n            Text(\"You’ve tapped \\(counter) times\")\n                .font(.headline)\n            Button(\"Tap Me\") {\n                counter += 1\n            }\n            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)\n        }\n        .padding()\n    }\n}\n\nstruct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\n    static var previews: some View {\n        ContentView()\n    }\n}\n\nPress Cmd+R to build and run your app in the iOS Simulator.\nInteract with the button to see your app respond.\nExperiment with lists, navigation, and data flow.\nLearn about Combine framework for reactive programming.\nFollow Apple’s official SwiftUI tutorials and documentation.\nBy starting with these steps, you’ll build a solid foundation for SwiftUI development in 2025 and beyond. Keep coding and exploring new features as Apple updates the ecosystem!\nHappy coding! 🚀",

But once I started estimating real-world costs for my project, I realized they add up fast, and that’s a problem when you're launching without real users yet.\nSo I built my SaaS, Odichat, with a different approach — one that costs me $45/month and gives me full control, solid performance, and zero vendor lock-in.\nLet me break it down.\nHere’s what I’m running:\nA production-ready Rails 8 app\nA staging environment for safe deployments\nFile storage for user uploads\nTransactional emails\nBackground job processing\nWebsockets\nCaching\nAnd all of this for $45/month.\nHere’s the exact monthly breakdown:\nHetzner dedicated vCPU (production): $13.49\nHetzner shared vCPU (remote builder): $4.99\n(used for asset precompilation and deploys)\nHetzner shared vCPU (staging): $4.99\nDigitalOcean Spaces (file storage): $5.33\nZoho Mail (support email inbox): $1\nPostmark (transactional emails): $15\nTotal: $45.80 USD/month\nI’m using SQLite3 as the database.\nYep, SQLite in production.\nIt’s free, and for my current load it works perfectly. I haven’t had a single issue that justifies migrating to PostgreSQL (yet).\nRails 8 ships with the “Solid” suite:\nSolid Queue (background jobs)\nSolid Cache\nSolid Cable (Websockets)\nIt’s a full-featured solution without extra setup or Redis requirements. And it performs great.\nBecause I want:\nPredictable, low costs\nZero surprises from usage-based pricing\nInfra I understand and can control\nThe ability to grow into higher traffic without switching stacks\nI’m not anti-serverless. But at this stage, this is the simplest and most sustainable setup I’ve found.\nIt’s not “trendy”.\nIt’s not “modern”.\nBut it works AMAZINGLY well, it’s cheap, and it lets me focus on building, not budgeting.\nIf you’re building a SaaS and want full control without overpaying early on, I highly recommend exploring this kind of setup — especially if you’re using Rails.",

Think of an Object as a digital container that holds data and rules about how that data can be used. For example, an NFT Object might store the image URL, its name, and who owns it.When you create an Object (like minting a new NFT), you use something called a ConstructorRef. This is like a special key that lets you set up the Object and decide what rules or resources (like ownership details) it should have.

LiveAPI helps you discover, understand, and use APIs in large tech infrastructures with ease.\nDNS (Domain Name System) is essentially the Internet’s “phonebook” – a distributed directory that maps human-readable names to machine addresses. \nIn practice, when you visit example.com or call an API by name, DNS translates that name into an IP (e.g. 93.184.216.34) so your computer can connect. \nThis global, hierarchical system is everywhere under the hood of web apps: it’s how your browser finds servers, how microservices talk to each other by name, and how clouds (like AWS Route 53 or Cloudflare DNS) steer traffic.  \nIf DNS isn’t wor…",

Types are the backbone of Rust's safety guarantees, but raw types like i32, String, or Vec<T> can sometimes lack semantic meaning and lead to subtle bugs when misused. Imagine accidentally swapping two integers meant for different purposes, like a user ID and a product ID, in a function call—there’s no compiler safeguard to catch that mistake.  \nEnter type aliases and newtypes: two powerful tools for giving raw types clearer meaning and enforcing type safety. They help you write code that's easier to understand, harder to misuse, and safer overall. In this blog post, we'll explore these tools, illustrate their usage with practical examples, and discuss common pitfalls to avoid. B…",

Factory workers, often seen as low-status laborers, had little agency beyond their assigned duties. This division meant that problem-solving and innovation were the sole province of experts and senior staff, not the rank-and-file.

          "description": "A major breakthrough in cancer care is making headlines. Scientists from the US, UK, and Switzerland have developed a cutting-edge test that predicts which men with aggressive, non-metastatic prostate cancer are most likely to benefit from the drug abiraterone. This is significant because while abiraterone can save lives, it also causes serious side effects such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart complications.\nUntil now, doctors had no reliable way to know who should receive the drug. This new test, powered by machine learning, changes that. It analyzes digital images of tumor biopsy samples and identifies a specific biomarker that indicates whether a patient is likely to respond to treatment.\nIn a study involving over one thousand men, the test found that twenty five percent of them had this biomarker. For these patients, abiraterone reduced the risk of death within five years from seventeen percent to nine percent. For the rest, the drug showed little to no effect, meaning they could avoid unnecessary treatment and side effects.\nThe test is designed to work with routine clinical data and can easily be added to existing hospital workflows. It promises to make prostate cancer treatment more precise, sparing patients who do not need aggressive therapies and ensuring those who do get the help they need.\nResearchers also hope the findings will encourage broader approval of abiraterone for early-stage use, especially in the UK where its application has been limited. With this test, the decision becomes more scientific, more ethical, and far more personal.\nRead more here:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/30/new-ai-test-can-predict-which-men-will-benefit-from-prostate-cancer-drug",

And now you're in a staring contest with a stack trace that refuses to make sense.\nSo I built a plugin that generates a ready-to-use prompt you can drop into any AI chat (ChatGPT or your favorite LLM). It packs in all the useful context: test steps, environment info, error messages, and stack traces, so the AI actually gets what happened.\nNo digging through logs. No re-explaining your setup. Just click \"Copy Debug Prompt\", paste it into ChatGPT, and get help that makes sense.\nThe plugin hooks into Cypress's failure handling. When a test fails, it captures the error message, test title, relevant stack trace, and even the surrounding context, then wraps it all into a clean, AI-friendly prompt.\nTo see the \"Copy Debug Prompt\" button we have to install the plugin:\nnpm install -D cy-copy-prompt\n\nthen add this line to cypress/support/e2e.js\nimport 'cy-copy-prompt';\n\nNow, whenever a test fails, you'll see a \"Copy Debug Prompt\" button in the Cypress app. One click, and your clipboard is loaded with a prompt that's ready to paste into AI chat.\nPrompt Copied to Clipboard:\n\nThen paste it:\n\nInspired by Playwright's \"Copy Prompt\" feature, this plugin brings the same convenience to Cypress. It's simple, helpful, and open source.\nTry it out. If you like it, star it, fork it, or suggest a tweak.",

          "description": "One of the most common types of noise in digital images is impulse noise, also known as salt-and-pepper noise. This type of noise randomly alters certain pixels in the image by setting them to the minimum or maximum possible intensity values (e.g., 0 and 255 in 8-bit images), while the rest of the pixels remain unchanged.\nApplying a Gaussian filter in these cases is counterproductive. Convolution with a Gaussian kernel smooths the image through a weighted averaging operation, which affects both noisy and non-noisy pixels. This not only fails to effectively remove the noise, but also introduces widespread blurring in the image\nAs an alternative, the median filter offers a much more suitable solution. This filter replaces the value of each pixel with the median of the intensity values of its neighbors within a local window (typically square-shaped). By focusing on the central value of the sorted data, the median filter preserves edges and is highly effective at removing outliers such as those introduced by salt-and-pepper noise.\nThe basic procedure for applying the median filter consists of the following steps:\nFor each pixel, define a local window of size w × w centered on that pixel.\n2.Extract all intensity values within that window.\n3.Sort the values.\n4.Replace the central pixel value with the median of the sorted list.\n\nRead the full article here.",

Today, let’s dive into something more hands-on: threat modeling.\nIf you're not familiar with the term, think of threat modeling as the process of asking, “What can go wrong?” before your AI app is exposed to the real world. For AI systems, this means looking beyond traditional vulnerabilities and into the unique risks that come with using models, training data, and user prompts.\nThreat modeling isn’t new. It’s been a common part of security practices for years. But when it comes to AI, we’re dealing with components that behave differently:\nThe model is dynamic and often unpredictable.\nThe data is unstructured and possibly user-generated.\nThe logic isn’t just written in code — it’s embedded in w…",

          "description": "I've been working on a small but complete side project in C# – a playable Blackjack game that runs entirely in the console.\nWhat started as a practice run to sharpen my .NET and clean coding skills turned into a minimal but functional card game, with some extra flair like card rendering and a basic AI bot.\nHere's a breakdown of the project and what I learned along the way.\n\n\nConsole-based, cross-platform (runs on .NET 9)\nUnicode card rendering (text-based but visually clear)\nFully playable: hit, stand, dealer logic, win/loss detection\nSimple AI bot using true count (Hi-Lo style)\nThe code is split into logical components:\nProgram.cs: main game loop, player input, win/loss handling\nCards.cs: deck generation, card drawing, visual rendering\nBot.cs: AI logic — currently uses a basic running count to decide whether to hit or stand\nThe goal was to keep the structure clean and extensible, so it’s easy to maintain and improve.\nYou can find the full source code here:\n🔗 https://github.com/porzeraklon/blackjack\nIt's open-source and self-contained — no dependencies besides the .NET runtime.\nI'm open to suggestions and contributions — especially around:\nImproving bot intelligence (more advanced strategy, more diversified behavior)\nGame configuration options (e.g. changing stakes, betting)\nGUI version later down the road\nIf you check it out, feel free to leave feedback or open an issue. Hope it inspires someone else working on a similar idea.\nThanks for reading!",

But in a table with hundreds of thousands or millions of rows, the difference between having a lookup structure and lacking one can be dramatic.\nDespite their importance, indexes are sometimes added without much thought or reviewed too infrequently. As data and queries change, a search key that once helped may now be hurting performance. That’s why inspecting and understanding existing indexes is not just a task for optimization but an ongoing part of maintaining a healthy database.\nIndexes improve read performance by reducing the volume of data MySQL must scan to satisfy a query.

This includes everything from optimizing logistics routes across millions of possibilities to modeling molecules for next-generation pharmaceuticals. For Paul Leongas, the real magic happens when we pair this revolutionary computing power with forward-thinking product strategies.\n\"Product managers today must prepare for a w…",

What’s the problem? Like a lot of things, it’s easier to explain with an example.\nLet’s say we have a system that helps you find people for upcoming job shifts. It sends a notification to someone asking if they want a shift on Saturday from 12 pm to 3 pm at a given address. A few people respond “yes,” you pick someone, and that person gets notified that they’ve got the gig. If the time of the shift changes or it gets cancelled altogether, the system sends them another notification.\nNow let’s zoom in. The job is offered.

Your application could be cloud-native. But can your system handle unpredictable traffic spikes, cascading failures, or regional outages? That’s where resilience testing steps in.\nWhat Is Resilience Testing?\nResilience testing evaluates how a system behaves under failure conditions. It doesn’t just ask “Does it work?” but “What happens when it breaks?”\nIt simulates:\nServer failures\nNetwork slowdowns\nDependency crashes\nPower outages\nAnd ensures your system recovers gracefully.\nWhy Is It Important?\nModern architectures rely on distributed systems, microservices, and cloud infrastructure. These are fast and scalable but also more complex and interdependent.\nEven a single point of failure like a downed DNS server can lead to hours of downtime. Resilience testing identifies weak links before your users do.\nReal-World Example\nStartups, banks, hospitals all rely on resilient systems to ensure uptime, customer trust, and compliance.\nWhat Should You Test?\nA complete resilience testing strategy includes:\nInfrastructure failure: What if an availability zone goes down?\nApplication failure: What if a microservice crashes?\nNetwork instability: Can services handle latency?\nResource exhaustion: How does your system behave under stress?\nBest Practices\nIntroduce failures gradually.\nMonitor everything latency, error rates, recovery times.\nUse automated tools like Gremlin, Chaos Mesh, or AWS Fault Injection Simulator.\nAlways run post-mortems to fix root causes.\nWhat It Means for You\nIf you're investing in uptime, user experience, and SLA commitments, this should be on your radar.\nWant to learn how Signiance helps teams implement resilience testing at scale?\nthe full blog",

In a recent AnsweRED podcast appearance, art director Alena Dubrovina explained they toyed with indie-book aesthetics before finally landing on a richer, grounded style reminiscent of Divinity: Original Sin.\nWhy it matters: The team’s rigorous “complete turnarounds” and head-sculpt reworks show just how crucial visual identity was to BG3’s success—and while that realistic approach paid off, Dubrovina hopes one of Larian’s upcoming titles will finally lean into a bolder, cartoon-y vibe.",

Every unboxed unit is locked behind a mandatory Day 1 system update—so you’ll need to hook up to the internet (or hope physical games include the patch) before any software — old or new — will boot.\nWith launch day set for June 5, Twitch unboxings and store sightings are just the appetizer.

Ampere’s data differs—500 K on PS5 and over 2 million on Xbox (mix of purchases and Game Pass)—but everyone agrees sales are underwhelming for an AAA DOOM release.\nBeyond the eyebrow-raising player-count flex, slow Steam uptake and lukewarm fan sentiment (especially vs. DOOM 2016/Eternal) have reignited the great $70 game-price debate.

          "description": "DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs have just open-sourced the code for AlphaFold 3, the latest and most powerful version of their AI system for predicting biomolecular structures. Unlike its predecessor, AlphaFold 3 can model not only proteins but also DNA, RNA, and small molecule interactions. This release is set to transform the fields of structural biology, drug discovery, and synthetic biology.\nThe newly released AlphaFold 3 pipeline allows scientists and engineers to predict complex molecular assemblies with unprecedented accuracy. This includes protein-ligand binding, nucleic acid interactions, and even multi-protein complexes — tasks that were previously the domain of expensive wet-lab experimentation.\nWhat makes AlphaFold 3 particularly exciting for developers is the modular and Python-accessible architecture. Bioinformaticians, AI researchers, and biotech engineers can now directly integrate these models into their workflows, accelerating everything from target identification to molecule design. The fusion of machine learning and biology has never been more seamless.\nAs AI continues to unlock new frontiers in life sciences, AlphaFold 3 sets the stage for a future where protein design and therapeutic discovery can be driven by open, programmable, and intelligent systems.\nhttps://github.com/deepmind/alphafold\nhttps://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphafold-3-predicting-the-shape-and-interactions-of-everything-protein",

          "description": "By now, most developers are familiar with Generative AI, the kind that writes text, generates code, creates images, or summarizes data. It’s powerful, but it’s also... reactive. You give it a prompt, it gives you a result. End of story.\nBut lately, there’s a new player making waves: Agentic AI. And it’s not just a buzzword.\nHere’s the key difference:\nGenerative AI creates content or suggestions when asked.\n\n\nAgentic AI goes further — it takes initiative, makes decisions, and executes tasks autonomously.\n\n\n\nLet’s say your AI detects low inventory.\nA generative model might say: “You’re running low on product X.”\n\n\nIt’s the difference between assistance and action.\nWe explained this in a recent conversation:\nAgentic AI vs Generative AI Explained Simply\nIf you’re building AI apps or exploring automation in your projects, this shift from suggestion to execution could be a game-changer.\nCurious to hear from you!\nWhere do you see Agentic AI making the biggest impact? 🤔",

          "description": "NVIDIA has just announced native support for Python in its CUDA platform, marking a major shift in how developers can access GPU acceleration. For the first time, Python developers can write CUDA programs without needing to rely on C or C++ bindings. This native integration drastically lowers the barrier for using GPUs in scientific computing, AI, and data-heavy Python applications.\nThe new cuda-python package gives direct access to CUDA’s driver and runtime APIs, letting users launch kernels, manage memory, and control streams entirely from Python. It also includes support for just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which means you can write dynamic GPU code directly in Python, compile it on the fly, and run it immediately.\nA key innovation is the new CuTile programming model, which brings a tile-based structure to CUDA operations. CuTile is designed to feel natural to Python users familiar with NumPy and CuPy, and it allows for efficient manipulation of large data arrays without needing to manage threads manually.\nThis move brings CUDA closer to Python’s ecosystem and could reshape how GPU computing is taught, deployed, and scaled across AI and HPC workloads.\nRead the full announcement here:\nhttps://thenewstack.io/nvidia-finally-adds-native-python-support-to-cuda/\nOfficial documentation from NVIDIA:\nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-python",

It looks... different — in a good way.\nThe Opera Neon UI looks like it was designed to end tab chaos.\nYou get visual tabs that show a preview of each page, which makes jumping between websites feel more intuitive than just staring at a bunch of favicons.\nThere’s also a floating sidebar that holds key tools like bookmarks, workspace controls, and the AI assistant — all tucked neatly to the side without taking up valuable screen real estate.\nAnd that’s just scratching the surface.\nWant to know how Opera Neon uses AI to organize your tabs, issue distraction warnings, and even make activity-based suggestions?\nRead the full deep dive here:\n\nOpera Neon 2025: AI Browser Review\nThis article was originally published on patangrid.site and is syndicated here for broader reach.",

While AI promises innovation and efficiency, it also presents significant challenges that require urgent attention.\nUp to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs risk displacement due to automation, with unemployment potentially rising to 20%, a rate not seen since the Great Depression (Anthropic CEO Dario Amod).\nCurrently, 14% of the global workforce—approximately 375 million workers—have been affected by AI through job losses or career changes, with around 5 million jobs lost worldwide.\nThe most impacted sectors include customer service (1.2 million jobs lost), IT services (850,000), warehousing and logistics (1.1 million), administrative and clerical roles (750,000), banking (400,000), and retail (300,000).\nWomen’s jobs are disproportionately vulnerable, with 41% of female roles at risk compared to 28% for men, reflecting the higher concentration of women in automatable sectors.\nAttempts by companies like Clara and IBM to fully replace human roles with AI have demonstrated the limitations of automation, highlighting the continued importance of human skills.\nLooking ahead, by 2026, AI is projected to displace 75 million jobs globally but create 133 million new jobs, emphasizing a shift toward roles requiring new and different skills.\nThis transition risks exacerbating inequality, favoring those with greater education and resources, and posing a challenge for inclusive economic growth.\nThe path forward requires coordinated action:\nAccelerated workforce retraining and upskilling programs\nThoughtful regulation of AI adoption\nStrategic planning to ensure equitable opportunities in the evolving job market\nAs AI continues to evolve, organizations and governments must collaborate to create a future of work that balances innovation with inclusivity and social responsibility.\nHow is your organization preparing for the impact of AI on jobs?",

          "description": "No artigo de hoje, vamos falar sobre uma prática da qual eu já fui vítima, e você, leitor, provavelmente também já foi (ou ainda está sendo).\nTrata-se da famigerada prática de criar endpoints excessivamente verbosos. Quando estamos desenvolvendo uma API REST para nosso sistema, é comum tentarmos facilitar o acesso a dados muito específicos. No entanto, isso muitas vezes se transforma em uma bola de neve.\nQuem nunca se pegou pensando: “Só mais um endpoint e tudo estará resolvido”... e repetiu isso incontáveis vezes?\nIsso acontece porque ignoramos um fator muito importante no conceito de API: ela deve servir como um portal de acesso aos recursos gerais do sistema, e não como um grande servidor repleto de rotas altamente específicas para cada situação.\nEsse problema costuma surgir, principalmente, quando lidamos com recursos que estão relacionados entre si.\nPense na seguinte situação:\nVocê precisa listar usuários que possuem tarefas atribuídas. A abordagem comum e tentadora é criar um endpoint como:\n/getUsersWithTasks\nMas esse tipo de design fere princípios fundamentais de uma API bem construída. Em vez disso, pense na sua API como uma interface para recursos, e usuários são um recurso. Logo, uma forma mais adequada e escalável seria algo como:\n/users?withTasks=true\nEsse formato segue o padrão REST, é mais flexível e permite expandir facilmente os filtros no futuro, como:\n/users?withTasks=true&active=true\nEvite criar endpoints com verbos como get, delete ou create. Além de quebrar os princípios REST, isso torna sua API redundante e desnecessariamente verbosa. Por exemplo:\n🚫 /getUserById\nAlém disso:\nPrefira filtros via query parameters em vez de encher a URL com parâmetros.\nMantenha seus endpoints focados em recursos, não em ações.\nSeguindo essas dicas simples, sua API se tornará muito mais limpa, intuitiva, escalável e fácil de manter.",

          "description": "Google, founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, has become one of the most influential technology companies in history. Originally launched as a search engine, Google transformed how people access and interact with information online.\nAt the heart of Google's success is its powerful search algorithm, which ranks web pages based on relevance and authority. This innovation not only made Google the go-to search engine globally but also revolutionized the digital marketing industry through platforms like Google Ads and Google Analytics.\nOver the years, Google expanded far beyond search. It developed the Android operating system, now the most widely used mobile OS, acquired YouTube to dominate online video, and introduced Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome, and the Google Workspace suite. Each of these tools became a cornerstone of modern digital life.\nThe company’s parent organization, Alphabet Inc., was created in 2015 to oversee a broader range of ventures, including artificial intelligence (DeepMind), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), and life sciences (Verily). Google continues to lead in AI, with products like Google Assistant and its recent work on generative AI models.\nHowever, Google's dominance has also sparked concerns over privacy, market monopoly, and data ethics. Antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. and abroad highlight the tension between innovation and regulation in the digital era.\nToday, Google remains a symbol of innovation and connectivity, shaping how billions of people learn, communicate, and do business.

But after spending time with it and building real projects, I realized that this simplicity is actually what makes Go so powerful. In this blog post, I’ll try to explain why Go is such a great programming language, especially for people who want to build solid, fast, and reliable software.\nGo is very easy to learn. The syntax is small, and you can understand most of it in a day or two. You don’t need to learn a huge number of features to be productive. There are no crazy complex patterns, and you won’t find tons of hidden magic. What you write is what you get.\nThis simplicity helps teams move faster. Everyone understands the code easily.

It connects various data points across your environment, helping security teams understand when something suspicious may be occurring, even if it appears harmless in isolation.\nLegacy security solutions are typically reactive and rule-driven.

Your team discusses important improvements, identifies action items, and reaches consensus on priorities - then someone has to manually recreate everything in Confluence for documentation.\n\nMost teams face the same challenge: retrospective insights need to live in Confluence for stakeholder updates, team reference, and organizational knowledge - but manual recreation is time-consuming and details get lost.\nKollabe's new Confluence integration transforms completed retrospectives into comprehensive Confluence pages with a single click.\n\nComplete retrospective summary: All items, discussions, and outcomes\nProfessional formatting: Clean, readable layouts that preserve context\nAction items highlighted: Key takeaways prominently displayed\nVoting data preserved: Team consensus and priority rankings maintained\n\nChoose exactly where your documentation goes:\nSelect specific Confluence space\nPick exact page hierarchy location\nIntegrate with existing documentation structure\nMaintain organizational consistency\nRetrospective insights become permanent, searchable team knowledge instead of isolated session records. Teams can:\nReference past improvements when similar issues arise\nTrack improvement themes across multiple sprints\nShare outcomes with stakeholders easily\nBuild organizational memory that survives team changes\nThe setup is straightforward:\nConnect your Confluence account via OAuth\nSelect your target space and page location\nClick export after your retrospective\nAccess formatted documentation immediately\n\nThis feature is available for all Kollabe users.

I learned:\nHow servers actually work\nBuilding REST APIs from scratch\nRouting, middleware, and even a bit of MongoDB\nI started building full-stack apps. Not huge ones, but they were mine. And they worked.\n❤️ What I Learned Beyond Code\nIt taught me:\nTo be patient with myself\nTo Google like a ninja\nThat everyone starts as a beginner\nAnd that the “hero” isn’t someone who knows everything, but someone who doesn’t stop learning\n🚀 To Anyone Starting Now...\nThe Namaste series didn’t just teach me code.

I've got you covered! I recently created a solution that bridges Fail2Ban security monitoring with Microsoft Teams notifications, complete with geographical information about potential attackers.\nAs a system administrator, monitoring server security events can be challenging. Fail2Ban does an excellent job of detecting and blocking malicious activities, but by default, you only know about these events when you actively check the logs. What if you could get real-time notifications directly in your Teams workspace with detailed information about each security incident?\nI developed fail2ban-ms-teams-noti…",

          "description": "Smart contracts are the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. These contracts are written in Solidity, a statically typed, contract-oriented programming language tailored for Ethereum. One critical yet often overlooked aspect of smart contract development is how contracts are initialized when deployed to the blockchain.\nThis blog post offers a deep dive into the concept of constructors in Solidity, how they work, their purpose, and best practices to keep your contracts secure and efficient.\nA constructor is a special function in a Solidity contract that is executed only once, at the moment the contract is deployed. Think of it as the setup phase of your smart contract—this is where you define the initial state, set permissions, or configure parameters t…",

They’re TradFi in a blockchain costume.\nHere’s the inconvenient truth:\nWant to buy tokenized real estate? Great. But that token doesn’t give you squat unless a legal entity off-chain honors it.\nTreasury tokens? Same thing. You’re trusting a fund manager, custodian, or regulatory body to redeem it.\nIt’s not trustless. It’s regulatory theater with a smart contract backend.\nRWAs are less about empowering users and more about navigating global compliance.\nIt’s not about breaking the system. It’s about bending the rules just enough to extract value while pretending to be futuristic.\nThis isn’t DeFi. It’s just TradFi with faster accounting.\nLet’s be honest: most RWA projects don’t need a blockchain. They use it for:\nToken issuance\nCap table management\nTracking asset flow\nBut these are things spreadsheets and CRMs have done for decades.\nPutting it onchain doesn’t make it revolutionary — it just makes it buzzword-compliant.\nWeb3 wasn’t about rehypothecating bonds or making banks more efficient. It was about disintermediation.\nCutting out the middlemen. Giving power back to users. Trustless systems.\nRWAs? They reintroduce the middlemen — they just wear hoodies now.\nTokenized RWAs sound sexy, but they’re just Wall Street playing dress-up in Web3.\nUntil these assets are truly decentralized — not just onchain — they’ll remain more TradFi than DeFi.",

          "description": "AI-Powered Code Generation From Design\nStreamlining Design-to-Code Conversion\nAI tools are really changing how we build things, especially when it comes to turning design mockups into actual working code. It used to be that developers would spend a ton of time just translating what a designer made into code. Now, AI can take those designs and spit out production-ready code in a fraction of the time. This means projects can move a lot faster, and teams aren't stuck in that slow back-and-forth process. It's like having a super-fast assistant that understands design and can write code. This shift lets developers focus on more complex problems instead of repetitive coding tasks. It's a big deal for getting products out the door quicker.\nThe whole idea is to cut down on the manual work involved…",

          "description": "What is Binary Search\n\n\nImagine you are playing a game where you try to guess a secret number from 1 to 10, and you have infinite attempts. You can choose random numbers (without repetition)—maybe you will get lucky and guess it on the first try, or it might take you all 10 tries to reach it. Or you can try counting all the numbers in order—1, 2, 3, 4…—this will still take 10 guesses max, but in a more systematic way.\nBut what if you had to guess a number from 1 to 1000, or even 1 to a million? What about 1 to 10²⁰? As the range increases, brute force becomes impractical.\nComputer scientists faced the same problem: how do you efficiently find something in a huge range? One commonly used solution is binary search.\nBinary search works by dividing the range in half with each guess, determinin…",

But understanding queues isn’t just about putting items in and taking them out — it’s about knowing what kind of queue to use and when.\nIn this post, we’ll explore:\n✅ Different types of queues\nWhether you’re prepping for interviews, building scalable backends, or just exploring Python data structures, this guide is for you.\n📦 What is a Queue?\nA queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure — like a line at the bank. The first person to arrive is the first to be served.\nBut modern systems use variations of queues to solve different problems. That’s what we’ll dive into next.\n🧱 Queue Types & Use Cases\n🎯 Simple Queue\n• Behavior: FIFO\n🔁 Circular Queue\n• Behavior: FIFO with a circular buffer (head connects to tail)\n⏫ Priority Queue\n• Behavior: Elements are served based on priority\n🔄 Deque (Double-Ended Queue)\n• Behavior: Can insert/remove from both ends\n🤝 Concurrent Queue\n• Behavior: Thread-safe queue for multi-threaded systems\n🧵 Curious about thread-safe? It means multiple threads can access the queue without data corruption or race conditions.\n📩 Message Queue (Job Queue)\n• Behavior: Asynchronous communication between producers & consumers\n🛠 Practical Examples & Code\nEach queue is implemented in clean Python code in this GitHub repository:\nqueue-patterns GitHub Repo\nAll implementations include:\n📍 Why This Matters\nToo often, people use one kind of queue for everything. Understanding which queue fits which problem leads to:\nMastering queues isn’t just for computer science students — it’s for any developer working on backends, automation, data processing, or system design.\n🙌 Found this helpful?\nIf you learned something new or found this guide useful, please consider:\nLet’s keep learning and building together! 🚀",

This third post introduces you to list context in XS.\nWhat do I mean by list context?\nIn Perl, there are two main contexts in which a function can be called: scalar context and list context. Scalar context means that the function is expected to return a single value, while list context means that the function is expected to return a list of values.\nIn XS, list context is a bit more complex than scalar context. When a function is called in list context, it can return multiple values, so in XS you need to push each value onto the stack. This is done by manipulating ST and using the 'XSRETURN' macro, which takes the number of values to return as an argument. I will …",

          "description": "What is Quick Sort?\n\n\nQuick Sort is one of the most efficient and widely-used sorting algorithms in computer science. As a \"divide and conquer\" algorithm, it works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around it. Unlike Merge Sort, which always divides arrays exactly in half, Quick Sort's divisions depend on the chosen pivot.\nQuick Sort offers average-case time complexity of O(n log n) with in-place sorting capability, requiring only O(log n) additional memory for the recursion stack. However, its performance can degrade to O(n²) in worst-case scenarios, which makes pivot selection strategy important for optimal performance.\nThe tone of this article is assumes you are already familiar with Recursion. If that’s not the case or you need a quick refreshment, I’d suggest yo…",

          "description": "There’s something special about the first programming language you learn. For many developers, it becomes a nostalgic memory — one tied to discovery, frustration, creativity, and the thrill of solving problems for the first time. Whether it was the blinking cursor of a BASIC interpreter, a Python “Hello, World,” or writing HTML in a notepad file, that first step into code often shapes how we see technology and continue to learn it.\nSo, let’s talk about it:\nWhat was your first programming language, and what got you started with it?\nMaybe it was a class assignment, a YouTube tutorial, a book someone gave you, or pure curiosity. Some of us started with languages that are now considered “old school,” while others dove in through newer, high-level languages designed to be beginner-friendly. Some were drawn in by game modding, others by web development, and some just wanted to automate tedious tasks.\nAnd how do you feel about that first language now? Was it a good starting point? Would you recommend it to beginners today, or do you wish you’d started with something else?\nShare your story in the comments below.\nI’d love to hear what language kicked off your programming journey!",

Tudo isso conectado a um banco de dados PostgreSQL.\nFrontend (React): Uma interface de usuário responsiva, construída com React e TypeScript, utilizando Vite para agilidade no desenvolvimento. O frontend consome a API para mostrar os posts, o formulário de contato, e em breve, a seção de portfólio e o painel de gerenciamento de conteúdo (CMS).\nTecnologias no Comando 🛠️\nNo Backend (API):\nLinguagem: TypeScript\nRuntime: Node.js\nFramework: Express.js\nBanco de Dados: PostgreSQL\nAutenticação: JWT + bcryptjs\nServiços AWS: SES (para e-mails)\nNo Frontend\nBiblioteca: React.js\nLinguagem: TypeScript\nBuild Tool: Vite\nRoteamento: react-router-dom\nEste projeto não é apenas um portfólio; é um campo de aprendizado prático para arquitetura de software, boas práticas e, crucialmente, operações DevOps com foco em AWS. O backend já está 100% funcional, e o frontend está evoluindo rapidamente.\nQuer dar uma olhada no código para ver a evolução?

Since then, I’ve tinkered with Docker, Git, Bash, and solved a few problems in C and Python. That’s the extent of my progress so far.  \nMy plan? Combine the course with open resources like DE ZoomCamp. I also want to try the LLM ZoomCamp — apparently, RAG is that tech I wanted to learn but didn't know its name. Heh.\nTurns out, my API knowledge is… nonexistent. Who knew there was more to APIs than just REST? 😴😅\n\n\nI still second-guess myself in basic Python sometimes...  \n\n\n\nFor example, this question tripped me up earlier. I didn’t have an interpreter at hand, so I went with intuition. Surprisingly, my intuition was right.\nQ: Is this code valid?\nclass demo(list):\n    def __test__(self, key):\n        return []\na = demo()\na['test'] = 7\nprint(a)\n\n\n\n  \nStill believe that coding is often an experimental science: you learn by running code.\nCompared namespace vs. scope today. They’re both about name visibility, but:  \nNamespaces are explicit containers (to avoid conflicts).  \n\n\nScopes are implicit, tied to code blocks (where a name is accessible).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  ⚙️ Plans for tomorrow\n\n\nStill wrestling with my environment setup — nothing feels quite right yet. \nMaybe tomorrow I'll do something about it finally and will be able to complete more than just a few random coding questions in Google Colab.",

Double fail.\n\nUse single quotes when your string contains a '!'. File written. Permissions set.

Sometimes it works more or less well.\nI believe that this one thing is the reason why projects are not fulfilling, don't work or simply fall by the wayside.\nOur brain can do many things, but one thing it cannot do. Multitasking. It is said that women are better at it than men. And that may be true. But it's still bad.\nIt is both a curse and a blessing. But this skill of doing one thing with everything you have is incredibly powerful. It may sound like a fortune cookie saying, but you really can do anything with it. It's a superpower.\nOne trap I often fall into is the fact that I believe that if I only do one thing, I have to do it perfectly. It has to be worth it, right?

One approach to achieve this is by using containerization with Docker. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of using containerized Java microservices and provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement this architecture.\nIdentify the microservices: Break down your application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately.\nChoose a containerization platform: Select a suitable containerization platform, such as Docker, and install it on your development environment.\nCreate a Dockerfile: Write a Dockerfile that defines the instructions for building and running your microservice.\nBuild and run the container: Use the Dockerfile to build a Docker image and run the container.\nIntegrate with other services: Integrate the containerized microservice with other services in your application.\nBy following these steps, you can design a scalable and maintainable Java microservice architecture using containerization with Docker.

In Part 1, we laid the groundwork; now, in Part 2, we're diving into the critical concept of encryption at rest.\nSimply put, encryption at rest in Kubernetes refers to how the API server encrypts data before storing it in etcd. Think of etcd as the brain of your Kubernetes cluster - it's where all your cluster's configuration data, state, and secrets live.\nBy default, the Kubernetes API server stores resources in etcd as plain text. This means if someone gains unauthorized access to your etcd, they can read all your sensitive data, including secrets, without any effort. This is a significant security risk.\nWhile encryption at rest applies to any Kubernetes resource, in this series, we'll continue to focus on Secrets …",

It's a world where we grow, learn, and develop social skills, and create memories that last a lifetime. From the chaotic morning rush to the evening reflection, school life is a journey of self-discovery, where we form meaningful relationships, discover our strengths and weaknesses, and learn to navigate the ups and downs of this journey.\n\nThe school day begins with a chaotic symphony of alarm clocks, breakfast on-the-go, and a mad dash to catch the bus. As we burst through the school gates, the sounds of chatter and laughter fill the air, a cacophony of excitement and anticipation. School is where we form some of our most meaningful relationships, bond over shared interests, laughter, and adventures, and create memories that we'll cherish forever. Our friends are our support system, confidants, and partners in crime, and together, we navigate the ups and downs of school life, sharing our joys and sorrows. School is also about learning, growing, and developing new skills, where our teachers guide us, inspire us, and challenge us to reach our full potential.\nAs the school day comes to a close, we reflect on what we've learned, what we've accomplished, and what we could do better tomorrow. We think about our goals, our aspirations, and our dreams. School life is a journey of self-discovery, where we learn to navigate the ups and downs, and develop the resilience and determination to overcome obstacles. In conclusion, school life is a beautiful symphony of sounds, a rhythmic beat of lockers, lessons, and laughter. Let's remember to appreciate the little things, the moments that make us smile, and the lessons that shape us into the people we're meant to be.\nWhat are your thoughts?

But my mindset remained tactical — observe, adapt, deploy.\nBack then, there was no Stack Overflow, no YouTube how-tos. Just man pages, printed guides, and logs. And somehow, that made the learning stick deeper.\n🧠 What Made Linux Stick?\nSimple. The terminal felt like home.\nI wasn’t chasing certs (though I earned my RHCE 4 in Dec 2005).

By sampling DNA from some of the planet’s most remote and untouched ecosystems, the company has identified over one million previously unknown species. These discoveries are not just academic. They are fueling a next-generation AI platform designed to radically accelerate drug discovery.\nThe company’s genomic database is already among the largest of its kind. It is being used to train AI models that predict protein structures, functions, and interactions at unprecedented accuracy. This includes boosting tools like AlphaFold, which helps researchers visualize the shape of proteins based on genetic code alone.\nA major focus of the project is the identification of new large serine recombinases, a type of enzyme that can precisely insert large DNA sequences into the genome. These enzymes are considered highly promising for future gene therapies, including for cancer and rare genetic disorders.\nBasecamp Research is also trying to set a new standard in ethical science. The team works directly with local researchers and governments in the regions where DNA samples are collected. In return, partner countries receive royalties and scientific credit, avoiding the extractive models of earlier biotech ventures.\nThis combination of field biology, advanced sequencing, and deep learning could reshape how we find drugs, understand evolution, and build genetic tools. It is a powerful example of how AI, when paired with real-world data, can help uncover the deepest layers of life on Earth.\nRead the full story here:\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/9765ab86-0156-4901-b6ec-fbee465ab819",

A display designed for a handheld device is fundamentally different from one engineered for 24/7 operation in a high-temperature, high-vibration environment.\nIn this post, we’ll explore the core differences between industrial and consumer-grade TFT displays, and why choosing the wrong type can lead to premature failure, performance issues, or even safety risks in demanding applications.\nAn industrial TFT (Thin-Film Transistor) display is built to operate in harsh, mission-critical environments—think factory automation, medical equipment, agricultural systems, and outdoor kiosks.

          "description": "Sure! Here's a simple and beginner-friendly blog post about learning arrays and length in programming. This example is based on JavaScript, but I can adapt it to another language if you prefer.\nIf you're just starting your programming journey, two important concepts you'll often hear are arrays and length. Let’s break them down in a simple way.\nAn array is a way to store multiple values in a single variable.\nlet fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"];\n\nHere, fruits is an array that holds 3 values:\n\"apple\"\n\"banana\"\n\"cherry\"\nYou can think of an array like a box with compartments. Each compartment has a number (called an index), and it holds one item.\n\n\n\nIndex\nValue\n\n\n\n\n0\n\"apple\"\n\n\n1\n\"banana\"\n\n\n2\n\"cherry\"\n\n\n\n🧠 Remember: Indexes start at 0, not 1.\nWant to get \"banana\"? You use its index:\nconsole.log(fruits[1]); // Output: banana\n\nEvery array has a property called length, which tells you how many items are inside.\nconsole.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3\n\nEven if you don’t know what's in the array, .length helps you find out how many items it contains.\nYou can add new items using .push() and remove with .pop():\nfruits.push(\"mango\"); // Adds \"mango\" to the end\nconsole.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"mango\"]\n\nfruits.pop(); // Removes the last item (\"mango\")\nconsole.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\nYou can loop through arrays using a for loop:\nfor (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {\n  console.log(fruits[i]);\n}\n\nAn array stores multiple values in one variable.\nYou access values using index numbers, starting from 0.\nUse .length to find how many items are in the array.\nArrays are super useful for organizing data and are used in almost every programming language!\nLet me know if you'd like this blog translated into Hindi, Tamil, or another language, or if you want examples in Python, Java, or C++.",

At first, they are granted to you, and when the time comes, they are vested: The shares are yours!\nOnce you can vest your shares, you need to pay income tax on them. For example, if you get 10 shares worth $100 each at the time of vesting, you need to pay 52% of their value to taxes (that number depends on where you live). This means that for those 10 shares, you need to pay $520 in taxes.\nWe compared three options to handle the stocks given to you by the company:\nSell all when received: sell all 10 shares and take $480 home.\nSell to cover taxes: sell 6 shares, invest 4 shares, and take $80 home.\nKeep …",

          "description": "One of the most common ways to optimize the size of an application's bundle is code splitting. With code splitting, we divide the application into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This allows us to reduce the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and parsed when the user first opens the app.\nA simple and widely used approach to code splitting is splitting by page. The logic is straightforward: when a user opens Page A, there’s no need to load the code for Page B at that moment. This approach provides a significant improvement in initial load time, which is especially important for large applications.\nHowever, like any solution, this method comes with trade-offs. While first-time loading becomes faster, navigating between pages can feel slower. When the user switches …",
