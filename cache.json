          "description": "One of the most popular JavaScript libraries for developing user interfaces is React. React's component-based design enables developers to deconstruct intricate user interfaces into smaller, more manageable components. However, the quality of the React components could decrease as applications get bigger and more complicated, resulting in jumbled, difficult-to-maintain code.\nThe best approaches to developing cleaner React components will be discussed in this post. This useful tutorial will help you increase readability, maintainability, and performance whether you're new to React or trying to make your current codebase better.\nFor a project to succeed over the long run, writing code that is clear, effective, and maintainable is important. Tests, refactoring, and comprehension are all made ‚Ä¶",

But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.\nApart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:\nInter-team planning\nBrainstorming sessions\nPutting late sprints back on track\nDesigning requirements and user stories\nDecomposing a full project into milestones\nScoping tasks with Product people\nReviewing architecture designs\nNegotiating deadlines\nTalking to clients\nAnd that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn't surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can't replace that human interaction yet.\nBut sure, our job as coders will change. Even if we're skeptical about AI, we can't ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us.
