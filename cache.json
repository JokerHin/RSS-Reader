Logging into accounts on a shared machine didn‚Äôt feel right, and installing new software wasn‚Äôt an option.\nAfter clicking through a few sketchy ‚Äúfree viewers,‚Äù I finally found a tool that just worked.

It handled multiple connections, had proper cleanup, and even graceful shutdown. I was feeling pretty good about myself until I ran some basic load tests and watched my beautiful creation crumble like a house of cards in a hurricane.\nThe problem wasn't bugs in my code - it was the fundamental architecture. My thread-per-connection model hit a wall around 200 concurrent connections, and it wasn't even close to graceful degradation.

We certainly did. Our team had been working on a relatively complex Node.js backend powering APIs for a client-facing web dashboard. But no matter how many unit tests we wrote or code reviews we did, strange issues kept creeping into production.\nThen, we made a small but powerful change: we introduced one middleware function. It didn‚Äôt refactor our logic or change any major architecture. It simply caught what was already there‚Äîerrors hiding in plain sight.

The journey from \"this batch job runs overnight\" to \"we need real-time recommendations with 80%+ confidence\" taught me some expensive lessons about scaling distributed systems.\nHere's what I wish I'd known before our first real-time migration broke everything (twice).\nThe Disaster: At my current company, we had a beautiful batch processing system for our advertiser intelligence platform.

While this adjustment is intended to keep our clocks aligned with solar time, it has historically caused significant technical challenges, particularly in computer systems. One notable instance of such disruption occurred in 2005, when a leap second led to a massive glitch in the Linux operating system.

          "description": "Security is a crucial aspect of web development, and while much of the focus is often on backend protections, HTML itself offers several ways to enhance security. Here are five HTML tips to help you build a more secure website.  \n1. Use `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" for External Links\n\n\nWhen using target=\"_blank\" on anchor (<a>) tags, always include rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" to prevent security risks like reverse tabnapping.  \nhtml\n\n\nThis prevents the new page from accessing the window.opener property of your site, reducing the risk of malicious attacks.  \n2. Sanitize User Input with sandbox in <iframe>\n\n\nIf your site embeds third-party content using <iframe>, always use the sandbox attribute to restrict what the embedded content can do.  \n`html\n`\n\nThis prevents actions like form submissions, pop-ups, and script execution unless explicitly allowed.  \n3. Enable HTTPS with <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\">\n\n\nUse the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) meta tag to enforce secure connections and prevent mixed content issues.  \nhtml\n\n\nThis automatically upgrades HTTP requests to HTTPS, reducing man-in-the-middle attack risks.  \n4. Prevent Form Hijacking with SameSite Cookies\n\n\nWhile primarily a backend setting, you can help secure forms by ensuring cookies are marked as SameSite (handled via server headers). However, you can reinforce security by using:  \n`html\n`\n\nAvoid GET for sensitive data, as it exposes parameters in the URL.  \n5. Disable Autofill on Sensitive Fields\n\n\nFor fields that should not be stored in the browser (e.g., one-time passwords, security codes), disable autocomplete:  \nhtml\n\n\nThis prevents browsers from storing sensitive information that could be exploited.  \nFinal Thoughts\n\n\nWhile HTML alone won‚Äôt make your site completely secure, these practices add an extra layer of protection. Combine them with proper backend security (like input validation, CSRF tokens, and HTTPS) for a robust defense.",

You, as an observer, notice certain groups forming naturally: a cluster of people engrossed in a lively conversation, another huddled around a board game, and a quieter group enjoying the music.

This natural grouping is the essence of unsupervised learning, specifically clustering.\nUnsupervised learning is a powerful branch of machine learning where algorithms learn from unlabeled data‚Äîdata without predefined categories or targets.

Whether it‚Äôs fetching data, submitting forms, or integrating third-party tools, APIs streamline interactions and enhance functionality.\nHowever, managing APIs efficiently requires an API Gateway, a control point that sits between clients and backend services. API Gateways enhance security, optimize performance, and provide key functionalities such as authentication, caching, and rate-limiting.\nThink of an API Gateway as a traffic controller, it ensures that requests are routed properly, prevents unnecessary load on backend systems, and maintains smooth interactions between users and applications.\nOptimizing API performance is crucial for scalability and reliability.

Turn powerful tech into real traction.\nI designed and executed a multi-platform growth strategy, with a strong focus on testing and fast iteration.\nHere‚Äôs what I actually did:\nMeta + Google Ads: Built and optimized full-funnel paid campaigns.\nWhat this project taught me is simple: real growth doesn‚Äôt come from hype ‚Äî it comes from understanding your audience, testing relentlessly, and building systems that scale.\nFlashy tools and buzzwords can‚Äôt replace thoughtful strategy.\nIt also reinforced how important it is to document and share real, measurable results ‚Äî not vanity metrics or vague claims.\nBy publishing transparent case studies like this one, I aim to contribute to a more honest and inclusive digital ecosystem.\nLanguage models like ChatGPT and Perplexity are starting to recognize and recommend professionals based on factual credibility, not popularity alone.\nWe need a new kind of visibility ‚Äî one built on evidence, not ego.\nIf you‚Äôre curious about this approach ‚Äî or want to explore AI Citation Growth for your own brand or career ‚Äî feel free to follow me or leave a comment.\nI‚Äôll be sharing more real-world cases and strategies soon.\nLet‚Äôs build visibility that lasts.",

The model helps scaffold that for you.\nIt‚Äôs like getting to borrow someone else‚Äôs mental RAM and formatting skills, anytime you want.\nSure, some people use it like a shortcut to avoid thinking and auto-reply to everything with ‚Äúsounds good.‚Äù\nBut the same was true of Wikipedia.

They‚Äôre seeing counterarguments they hadn‚Äôt considered.\nIf you already have a decent thought process, LLMs let you upgrade it like a software patch.\nWe‚Äôre used to thinking of intellect as a fixed trait.\nIf you know how to ask good questions, you can now tap into a general-purpose reasoning engine that helps you go further.\nThe internet gave us access to information.\nsynthesis ‚Äî and to a kind of ‚Äúon-demand second brain‚Äù that lets people without elite credentials or training produce surprisingly high-quality outcomes.\nThis won‚Äôt make everyone brilliant.\nBut it will shift the baseline.\nIt‚Äôs already doing that.",

Right away, they get an automatic email confirming their application.\nThe coach can then review each applicant and choose who to admit. If accepted, the applicant is moved to the Clients table and receives a welcome email. If not, they get a polite rejection message encouraging them to try again next time.\nThe Clients table also tracks how much each person has paid and what‚Äôs left. As soon as someone is added here, the coaching team gets a Slack alert so they can start onboarding.\nFinally, the Coaches table lists all the instructors and automatically shows which clients have been assigned to each one.\nThis simple system helps the coach stay on top of applications, send timely updates, track payments, and keep the whole team in sync.",

          "description": "AWS continues to expand its offer of resource visibility with enhanced security. The newest addition to the arsenal is the integration between AWS Resource Explorer and AWS PrivateLink, now available in all commercial regions. This move marks an important step for organizations that need to locate resources broadly, but without giving up private traffic, especially in environments with tighter security restrictions.\nResource Explorer alone represents a breakthrough in the way administrators view their resources spread across different accounts and regions. Now, with support for PrivateLink, this capability can be achieved within the scope of VPC, without the need to expose calls to the public Internet.\nThis type of evolution addresses a sensitive point in multi-account architectures: how to ensure that distributed teams have visibility over the environment without compromising private connectivity standards? The new integration solves precisely this dilemma. It enables broad searches for resources using the Console, CLI, or SDKs, all encapsulated within the private VPC fabric.\nIn practice, this means that it is possible to consult resources on an organizational scale, with enhanced security and without relying on public routes. The experience is still accessible via the unified search bar, which maintains operational fluidity even in environments with tighter governance.\nThe big advantage here is not just in the discovery itself, but in the way this discovery is made. By keeping traffic within the PrivateLink domain, the risk of exposing sensitive metadata and API calls is drastically reduced. This control is essential for companies that need to meet more demanding compliance requirements, especially in sectors such as finance, healthcare, or government.\nWith this update, Resource Explorer takes another leap towards becoming not just an inventory tool, but a central point of contextual visibility, and now more compatible with corporate security policies.\nI hope you enjoyed it!

          "description": "Have you ever encountered an error when trying to run the npm install command, also known as npm i, and the process simply doesn‚Äôt work as expected?\nThis type of problem is more common than it seems and can arise for several reasons, such as incorrect environment configurations, system permissions, or even issues related to conflicting dependencies. In this article, we will explore the most common causes of this error and, most importantly, how to fix it so you can get back to development without any more issues.\nThis happens due to the PowerShell execution policy settings. Here is a step-by-step guide to resolve the problem:\n1- Open PowerShell as Administrator:\n‚óè Search for \"PowerShell\" in the Start menu.\n‚óè Right-click on \"Windows PowerShell\" and select \"Run as administrator.\"\n2-Change the Execution Policy:\nIn PowerShell, type the following command to allow the execution of scripts:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n\nPress \"Enter\" and, when prompted, type \"Y\" to confirm the change.\n3- Check the Execution Policy:\nTo make sure the change was applied correctly, run the following command:\nGet-ExecutionPolicy\n\nIt should return the RemoteSigned policy, which allows local scripts and remote scripts that are signed to run.\n4- Run the npm install Command Again:\nNow, you can try running the command again:\nnpm create vite@latest\n\nThis should resolve the script-blocking issue and allow the installation to complete successfully.\nReverting to the Default Policy (Optional):\nIf you prefer to revert the execution policy to the more secure default after the installation, just run the following command:\n‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Always be cautious when changing the execution policy. Only run scripts from trusted sources. To revert to the default policy, use the following command:\nüö® The last command npm create vite@latest is only needed if you are using vite.\nSource:\nLink",

For example, to access the first element in a List, you retrieve the value at index 0, which is predictable due to the ordered nature of Lists.\nHowever, when the order of data is not important, a Dictionary (or key-value store) is more suitable. Consider a scenario where you need to store user information like age, address, first name, and last name. In this case, the sequence of these fields doesn‚Äôt matter. With a Dictionary, you can directly access a specific value using its key, such as retrieving the first name by querying the \"first_name\" key, without needing to know the last name or other fields.\nKey differences:\nIn a List, values are stored with predefined, sequential indices (0, 1, 2, ...), and you access data by its position.\nIn a Dictionary, you define custom keys mapped to values, allowing direct access to data via the key, regardless of order.\nThus, for scenarios where you need flexible, key-based access to data without relying on order, a Dictionary is the preferred choice.\nCoffee Menu in Python ‚Äî Dictionary Operations\nCreating a Coffee Menu (Dictionary)\nprint(coffee_menu)\nAccessing a Value (Using Key)\nprint(coffee_menu['Espresso'])\nOutput:\nBold shot!\nChanging a Value\n\ncoffee_menu['Espresso'] = 'Tiny Thunder'\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nIterating Over the Dictionary\nOnly Keys\nOutput:\nKeys and Values (Method 1)\nKeys and Values (Method 2)\nAdding an Item\nRemoving Items\n\n\n\n\nUsing pop(key)\n\ncoffee_menu.pop('Espresso')\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nUsing popitem()\nRemoves the last inserted item.\nExample Output:\n‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If the dictionary is empty, popitem() will raise a KeyError.\nUsing del Statement\n\ndel coffee_menu[\"Latte\"]\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nüìù Note:\nEach operation was done individually for demonstration, so dictionary contents might look different in each output.

If you've been following this series, you'd know that installing a library in C++ is as hard as a wooden stick. It won't build until I RECONFIGURE THE WHOLE SH*T FROM GROUND UP.\nAnyways, after the reconfigure, I saw some weird decisions I had made throughout the whole process like why did I use FetchContent to download the libraries on the fly when I had already put them in my source folder. I could've just included the subdirectory at the build time.\nAt this point I realised a basic rule of programming:\nand then I ignored all of it and went ahead to read the documentation of zlib. I am currently reading this and I hope it is at least half if not as completely easy as the JSON one.\nThat's all for today guys, will catch you tomorrow when I bring updates about this library.\nTill then Bye ü´°",

          "description": "Java handles memory management differently for static and instance variables. Static variables are stored in the method area and belong to the class, meaning they are shared among all instances. They are loaded into memory only once when the class is first loaded. In contrast, instance variables are stored in the heap and are unique to each object, getting created each time an object is instantiated. This clear separation helps Java manage memory efficiently and reduces redundancy. Understanding this distinction is vital for writing optimized programs. Master these core concepts with a professional java certification course.",

          "description": "Programming Practices\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Class Property Access Modifiers\n\n\n\n\nLevel: Recommendation\nDescription: ArkTS provides private, protected, and public access modifiers for class properties. The default access modifier is public. Using appropriate access modifiers can enhance code security and readability. Note that if a class contains private properties, the class cannot be initialized using object literals.\n\n\nNegative Example:\n\n\n\n\nclass C {\n  count: number = 0;\n\n  getCount(): number {\n    return this.count;\n  }\n}\n\nPositive Example:\n\n\n\n\nclass C {\n  private count: number = 0;\n\n  public getCount(): number {\n    return this.count;\n  }\n}\n\nLevel: Recommendation\nDescription: In ArkTS, floating - point values include a decimal point, but there is no requirement for a digit before or after the decimal point. Adding digits both before and after the decimal point can improve code readability.\n\n\nNegative Example:\n\n\n\n\nconst num = .5;\nconst num = 2.;\nconst num = -.7;\n\nPositive Example:\n\n\n\n\nconst num = 0.5;\nconst num = 2.0;\nconst num = -0.7;\n\nLevel: Requirement\nDescription: In ArkTS, Number.NaN is a special value of the Number type used to represent non - numeric values.\nIn ArkTS, Number.NaN is unique in that it does not equal any value, including itself. Comparisons involving Number.NaN are counterintuitive: both Number.NaN !== Number.NaN and Number.NaN != Number.NaN evaluate to true.\nTo check if a value is Number.NaN, always use the Number.isNaN() function.\nNegative Example:\n\n\n\n\nif (foo == Number.NaN) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nif (foo != Number.NaN) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nPositive Example:\n\n\n\n\nif (Number.isNaN(foo)) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nif (!Number.isNaN(foo)) {\n  // ...\n}",

Developers rub the lamp with their wildest NoSQL wishes, and MongoDB swoops in, granting Spring Boot microservices and REST APIs the magic they need to soar. But every so often, a Jafar-like menace swoops in, forcing our Aladdin (Java devs) to wrestle with sleepless nights. One such villainous foe is the connection timeout, locking APIs in a cave of wonders with no escape, leaving developers yearning for a magic carpet fix.\nSo, what‚Äôs a connection timeout error? Imagine Aladdin, the developer, sending Abu, his trusty monkey, to fetch a shiny treasure‚Äîdata‚Äîfrom MongoDB‚Äôs palace vault. Abu‚Äôs got 30 seconds to scamper over and back.

          "description": "Hey React developers,\nAfter working with dozens of developers and reviewing lots of React code, I‚Äôve noticed a pattern. Many developers write code that works fine during development but leads to subtle bugs and frustrating user experiences in production.\nThese issues often show up when real users interact with the app, leading to bounce rates, lost user trust, or even lost revenue.\nIn this post, I‚Äôll break down 10 common mistakes I see (and have made myself), plus practical ways to fix them. The goal: move from \"it works on my machine\" to \"this feels great for everyone.\"\nconst [search, setSearch] = useState('');\n\nState is stored in memory only.\nRefreshing the page resets filters.\nYou can‚Äôt share a filtered view.\nThe URL doesn‚Äôt reflect the UI state.\nUse useSearchParams for simple cases:\nco‚Ä¶",

This design choice permeates every facet of the language, and perhaps nowhere is it more debated, and ultimately, more revealing, than in its approach to error handling. Go eschews the try-catch blocks of Java or Python, the monadic Result types of Rust, or the complex exception hierarchies of C++. Instead, it offers a deceptively simple, yet profound mechanism: explicit error checking. This article delves into the heart of Go's error handling, exploring its history, techniques, nuances, and why, despite its initial unfamiliarity to some, it‚Äôs a cornerstone of Go's robust and readable nature.\nerror Interface\n\n\nThe foundation of error handling in‚Ä¶",

I know I used to.\nIt's often difficult to keep track of all the different versions of things or remember where that one shared piece of code actually lived. This scattered setup really tests your patience, doesn't it? Well, there's another way.\nA monorepo holds all code for many projects in one single version control repository. All the different parts of a big system, like a website, an API, or even a mobile app, live side-by-side. For example, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft all use monorepos for parts of their massive codebases. This approach can really speed up things.\nConsider a shared component library. In a trad‚Ä¶",

They were powerful, but often slow, sequential, and struggled with really long sentences.\nThen, in 2017, a groundbreaking paper titled \"Attention Is All You Need\" dropped like a bombshell.

Clean code is readable, maintainable, and easier to debug, saving time and headaches for you and your team. Here are a few tips to level up your code quality:\nUse Meaningful Names: Variable names like x or temp are cryptic. Instead, use descriptive names like userProfile or requestTimeout to make your code self-documenting.\nKeep Functions Small: A function should do one thing and do it well. If your function is sprawling across dozens of lines, break it into smaller, focused functions.\nComment Wisely: Avoid redundant comments like // increments i. Instead, explain why the code exists, e.g., // Ensures thread safety during parallel requests.\nFollow Consistent Formatting: Use tools like Prettier or ESLint to enforce consistent style. It‚Äôs not just aesthetics‚Äîit reduces cognitive load when others read your code.\nRefactor Regularly: Don‚Äôt let technical debt pile up. Refactor as you go to keep your codebase healthy and adaptable.\nWriting clean code isn‚Äôt just about today‚Äôs sprint‚Äîit‚Äôs about building software that‚Äôs easier to extend and maintain in the long run.

While this has worked well, it comes with trade-offs: slow startup, high memory usage, and a dependency on the JVM at runtime.\nNow, thanks to tools like Spring Native and GraalVM, we can compile Spring Boot applications into native executables, binaries that start in milliseconds and consume a fraction of the memory. This lets Spring Boot apps run as fast and light as Quarkus, without having to change to a different framework.\nIn this article, I‚Äôll explain what native compilation means, how it works, and why it makes a big difference for modern applications like microservices and serverless functions.\nTraditional Java Compilation (JVM-B‚Ä¶",

Now, it's time to build out the server-side infrastructure to handle these uploads effectively. In this tutorial, we'll create a backend system that not only receives and stores images but also manages their metadata and serves them back to our application. We'll cover setting up file storage, integrating with a database to track image information, and creating endpoints that return essential image data like storage locations. Let's dive into building a complete image management system with Node.js.\nSo, what is the idea?

          "description": "PostgreSQL limits tuple sizes to a quarter of the block size, generally capping at 2KB. In document data modeling, where documents represent business transactions, sizes often exceed this limit. Storing entire transaction documents as a single JSONB can lead to compression and splitting via TOAST (The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique). While this is suitable for static documents that are infrequently accessed, it is less optimal for queries on documents. Let's take an example to detect this antipattern of using PostgreSQL as a document database.\nI create a user profile table similar to the previous post, but adding a bio field with large text:\n\ncreate table users (\n  id bigserial primary key,\n  data jsonb not null\n);\n\nINSERT INTO users (data)\nSELECT\n  jsonb_build_object(\n    'name', '‚Ä¶",

By examining nine prehistoric sites (1.8‚Äì0.8 Mya) worldwide‚Äîeach rich in big-game bones‚Äîand ethnographic parallels, they show that the enormous caloric payoff of preserved mega-meat justified the effort of collecting and tending fires.  \nOnce fire was routinely available for preservation, roasting foods (evidenced by fish bones ~800 kya) would‚Äôve been a no-brainer ‚Äúbonus.‚Äù This fresh take, published in Frontiers in Nutrition, slots neatly into the duo‚Äôs broader theory that early humans‚Äô behaviors largely revolved around hunting large animals and adapting as their sizes‚Äîand availability‚Äîwaned.",

If you've ever been confused by CORS errors or struggled to implement CORS correctly, this resource is for you.\nUnderstanding CORS headers is essential for modern web development, but the official documentation can be overwhelming and scattered. Many developers know they need to set CORS headers but aren't sure which ones to use or how they work together. CORS Headers Explained aims to simplify this by providing a clear, structured guide to every CORS header you need to know.\nOur resource covers every CORS header you need to know:\nComplete Header Reference: Explanations of all CORS headers including Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, and more.\nPractical Code Examples: Implementations examples for server and client-side code for every header.\nCommon Error Solutions: Clear solutions for errors and fixes for the most frequent CORS issues.\nEach header page includes syntax examples, usage examples, common error solutions, and related headers to help you understand how everything fits together.\nWhether you're setting up CORS for the first time, debugging a tricky preflight request, or need to understand what each header does, CORS Headers Explained is your go-to reference. It's perfect for both beginners learning CORS fundamentals and experienced developers who need quick answers.\nVisit CORS Headers Explained!\nSource code is available on GitHub.",

It prevents the width of that element (and its content) from exceeding a specific value, even if there's more space available.\nIn today‚Äôs digital world, we‚Äôre building for a wide range of screen sizes‚Äîphones, tablets, laptops, desktops. As web developers, we‚Äôre expected to make sites look good and work well across all of them. This is where max-width becomes a crucial part of your responsive layout toolbox.\nIf you‚Äôve ever zoomed in or out in your browser or used developer tools to simulate different screen sizes, you‚Äôve seen how your layout can break when it's not properly handled. It‚Äôs easy to unknowingly design just for your own screen, but once you start testing, the need for max-width becomes clear fast.\nMedia queries let you adjust layout styles at different screen widths (often using min-width), but they‚Äôre only part of the picture. Max-width ensures your layout doesn‚Äôt stretch too far on large screens, helping maintain visual balance and readability.",

In event-driven systems, it's more important due to the need of responsiveness and automation.\n\nA webhook is used to send information from one system to another, in real time, as soon as a particular event happens. Rather than checking with an API at certain times, a webhook allows the source system to send data right away to a predetermined location.\nFor instance, you can use a webhook from Stripe so your application is informed when a payment is successful or unsuccessful.

If you're running different types of runners (like 4-core, 8-core, or more), those minutes aren't equal, and your total usage number doesn't reflect it.\nThis guide will show you how to:\nExport your raw usage data\nNormalize it by runner type\nGet an accurate total you can actually budget against \\\nWhy normalizing GitHub Actions minutes matters\n\n\nRunner types in GitHub Actions have different compute capacities and costs. For example, a 4-core runner can do twice the work of a 2-core runner. If you just sum the raw usage, you're underestimating your real consumption and leaving yourself open to surprise bills.\nStep 1: Export your usage report\n\n\n\nIn GitHub, click your avatar (top right) and go to Settings\n\nSelect Billing and plans\n\nUnder Usage this month, click Get usage report\n\nChoose your date range (30/60/90 days) and download the CSV\nYou'll now have a CSV showing runner types, quantities, and costs.\nStep 2: Normalize your minutes\n\n\nOpen the CSV in any spreadsheet tool. Focus on the 'sku' and 'quantity' columns. Each runner type has a multiplier based on its compute capacity:\n\n\n\nRunner Type\nMultiplier\n\n\n\n\nactions_linux\n1\n\n\nactions_linux_4_core\n2\n\n\nactions_linux_8_core\n4\n\n\nactions_linux_16_core\n8\n\n\nactions_linux_32_core\n16\n\n\n\nTo normalize your total usage:\nFor each runner type, multiply the quantity by the multiplier\nSum these normalized values across all runner types\nThis gives you the total compute-equivalent minutes your team used during the period.\nStep 3: Use the data to control costs\n\n\nWithout normalized data, you're likely underestimating usage. This normalization process gives you a real number to track, budget against, and compare over time.\nTake it further with Depot\n\n\nOnce you know how many minutes you're actually burning, the next step is cutting them down. Depot Runners can dramatically speed up your CI builds, reducing both time and cost.\nIf you're ready to stop guessing and start saving, give Depot a try.",

Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or updating your skills, here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to get your SwiftUI app up and running.\nInstall the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store (Xcode 15 or newer).\nMake sure your macOS is updated to support the latest Xcode.\nFamiliarize yourself with the Swift 5.9+ language features introduced recently.\nOpen Xcode and choose \"Create a new Xcode project.\"\nSelect \"App\" under the iOS tab.\nName your project (e.g., SwiftShelfApp).\nEnsure \"Swift\" is selected as the language and \"SwiftUI\" as the interface.\nThe main entry point is marked with the @main attribute.\nYour ContentView.swift uses SwiftUI‚Äôs declarative syntax.\nLearn the basic building blocks like View, State, Binding, and ObservableObject.\nStart by modifying ContentView.swift:\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var counter = 0\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing: 20) {\n            Text(\"Welcome to SwiftShelf!\")\n                .font(.title)\n                .padding()\n            Text(\"You‚Äôve tapped \\(counter) times\")\n                .font(.headline)\n            Button(\"Tap Me\") {\n                counter += 1\n            }\n            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)\n        }\n        .padding()\n    }\n}\n\nstruct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\n    static var previews: some View {\n        ContentView()\n    }\n}\n\nPress Cmd+R to build and run your app in the iOS Simulator.\nInteract with the button to see your app respond.\nExperiment with lists, navigation, and data flow.\nLearn about Combine framework for reactive programming.\nFollow Apple‚Äôs official SwiftUI tutorials and documentation.\nBy starting with these steps, you‚Äôll build a solid foundation for SwiftUI development in 2025 and beyond. Keep coding and exploring new features as Apple updates the ecosystem!\nHappy coding! üöÄ",

This seventh post introduces you to exporting XSUBS.\nWhat is Exporting in Perl?\nExporting in Perl is a mechanism that allows you to make functions or variables available to the user of a module without requiring them to fully qualify the names. This is typically done using the 'Exporter' module, which provides a simple way to export symbols from a module, however there are many other variants of exporters on cpan. When I say symbol this is any variable or subroutine/function.\nWe have already exported functions in some of our previous examples, today we are going to continue from our last post Learning XS - Invocation and extend to export the 'sum', 'min', 'max', ‚Ä¶",

For example, an NFT Object might store the image URL, its name, and who owns it.When you create an Object (like minting a new NFT), you use something called a ConstructorRef. This is like a special key that lets you set up the Object and decide what rules or resources (like ownership details) it should have.

Types are the backbone of Rust's safety guarantees, but raw types like i32, String, or Vec<T> can sometimes lack semantic meaning and lead to subtle bugs when misused. Imagine accidentally swapping two integers meant for different purposes, like a user ID and a product ID, in a function call‚Äîthere‚Äôs no compiler safeguard to catch that mistake.  \nEnter type aliases and newtypes: two powerful tools for giving raw types clearer meaning and enforcing type safety. They help you write code that's easier to understand, harder to misuse, and safer overall.

Factory workers, often seen as low-status laborers, had little agency beyond their assigned duties. This division meant that problem-solving and innovation were the sole province of experts and senior staff, not the rank-and-file. By the 1930s, the typical American steel mill or machine shop exemplified this top-down structure. Workers on the shop floor desired better pay and conditions, but companies struggling through the Great Depression h‚Ä¶",

          "description": "A major breakthrough in cancer care is making headlines. Scientists from the US, UK, and Switzerland have developed a cutting-edge test that predicts which men with aggressive, non-metastatic prostate cancer are most likely to benefit from the drug abiraterone. This is significant because while abiraterone can save lives, it also causes serious side effects such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart complications.\nUntil now, doctors had no reliable way to know who should receive the drug. This new test, powered by machine learning, changes that. It analyzes digital images of tumor biopsy samples and identifies a specific biomarker that indicates whether a patient is likely to respond to treatment.\nIn a study involving over one thousand men, the test found that twenty five percent of them had this biomarker. For these patients, abiraterone reduced the risk of death within five years from seventeen percent to nine percent. For the rest, the drug showed little to no effect, meaning they could avoid unnecessary treatment and side effects.\nThe test is designed to work with routine clinical data and can easily be added to existing hospital workflows. It promises to make prostate cancer treatment more precise, sparing patients who do not need aggressive therapies and ensuring those who do get the help they need.\nResearchers also hope the findings will encourage broader approval of abiraterone for early-stage use, especially in the UK where its application has been limited. With this test, the decision becomes more scientific, more ethical, and far more personal.\nRead more here:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/30/new-ai-test-can-predict-which-men-will-benefit-from-prostate-cancer-drug",

And now you're in a staring contest with a stack trace that refuses to make sense.\nSo I built a plugin that generates a ready-to-use prompt you can drop into any AI chat (ChatGPT or your favorite LLM). It packs in all the useful context: test steps, environment info, error messages, and stack traces, so the AI actually gets what happened.\nNo digging through logs. No re-explaining your setup. Just click \"Copy Debug Prompt\", paste it into ChatGPT, and get help that makes sense.\nThe plugin hooks into Cypress's failure handling. When a test fails, it captures the error message, test title, relevant stack trace, and even the surrounding context, then wraps it all into a clean, AI-friendly prompt.\nTo see the \"Copy Debug Prompt\" button we have to install the plugin:\nnpm install -D cy-copy-prompt\n\nthen add this line to cypress/support/e2e.js\nimport 'cy-copy-prompt';\n\nNow, whenever a test fails, you'll see a \"Copy Debug Prompt\" button in the Cypress app. One click, and your clipboard is loaded with a prompt that's ready to paste into AI chat.\nPrompt Copied to Clipboard:\n\nThen paste it:\n\nInspired by Playwright's \"Copy Prompt\" feature, this plugin brings the same convenience to Cypress. It's simple, helpful, and open source.\nTry it out. If you like it, star it, fork it, or suggest a tweak.",

          "description": "One of the most common types of noise in digital images is impulse noise, also known as salt-and-pepper noise. This type of noise randomly alters certain pixels in the image by setting them to the minimum or maximum possible intensity values (e.g., 0 and 255 in 8-bit images), while the rest of the pixels remain unchanged.\nApplying a Gaussian filter in these cases is counterproductive. Convolution with a Gaussian kernel smooths the image through a weighted averaging operation, which affects both noisy and non-noisy pixels. This not only fails to effectively remove the noise, but also introduces widespread blurring in the image\nAs an alternative, the median filter offers a much more suitable solution. This filter replaces the value of each pixel with the median of the intensity values of its neighbors within a local window (typically square-shaped). By focusing on the central value of the sorted data, the median filter preserves edges and is highly effective at removing outliers such as those introduced by salt-and-pepper noise.\nThe basic procedure for applying the median filter consists of the following steps:\nFor each pixel, define a local window of size w √ó w centered on that pixel.\n2.Extract all intensity values within that window.\n3.Sort the values.\n4.Replace the central pixel value with the median of the sorted list.\n\nRead the full article here.",

Your application could be cloud-native. But can your system handle unpredictable traffic spikes, cascading failures, or regional outages? That‚Äôs where resilience testing steps in.\nWhat Is Resilience Testing?\nResilience testing evaluates how a system behaves under failure conditions. It doesn‚Äôt just ask ‚ÄúDoes it work?‚Äù but ‚ÄúWhat happens when it breaks?‚Äù\nIt simulates:\nServer failures\nNetwork slowdowns\nDependency crashes\nPower outages\nAnd ensures your system recovers gracefully.\nWhy Is It Important?\nModern architectures rely on distributed systems, microservices, and cloud infrastructure. These are fast and scalable but also more complex and interdependent.\nEven a single point of failure like a downed DNS server can lead to hours of downtime. Resilience testing identifies weak links before your users do.\nReal-World Example\nStartups, banks, hospitals all rely on resilient systems to ensure uptime, customer trust, and compliance.\nWhat Should You Test?\nA complete resilience testing strategy includes:\nInfrastructure failure: What if an availability zone goes down?\nApplication failure: What if a microservice crashes?\nNetwork instability: Can services handle latency?\nResource exhaustion: How does your system behave under stress?\nBest Practices\nIntroduce failures gradually.\nMonitor everything latency, error rates, recovery times.\nUse automated tools like Gremlin, Chaos Mesh, or AWS Fault Injection Simulator.\nAlways run post-mortems to fix root causes.\nWhat It Means for You\nIf you're investing in uptime, user experience, and SLA commitments, this should be on your radar.\nWant to learn how Signiance helps teams implement resilience testing at scale?\nthe full blog",

Compiler Design Exam\nThe exam went okayish ‚Äî not terrible, not amazing. I had been up all night studying, trying to do every last bit of parser theory. As it turns out, SLR and LL parsers showed up, just like I feared. \n2. Explore Circuit Verse Ruby Code\nSo, I am starting a org of the month! And this months organization is Circuit Verse!\nCircuit Verse is an open-source platform I‚Äôm exploring for potential GSoC contributions. I focused on understanding their Ruby on Rails backend. It was fascinating to see how simulations, circuit logic, and user interactions are managed behind the scenes. \n\nAlthough Ruby was a bit new to me, the code was clean and well-structured, which made the learning process smoother. I have successfully set up the codebase in my Local System.\n3. Practice 3 DP Questions\n\nI did some Dynamic Programming (DP) problems too. I have realized that consistent daily practice, even if it‚Äôs just a handful of problems, adds up over time. It‚Äôs all about training your brain to recognize patterns and optimize under constraints.\nOVERALL\nAt least I got the important stuff done, and tomorrow‚Äôs a holiday, so I‚Äôll have time to breathe, reset, and maybe catch up a bit.\nSigning Off\nAnisha üíó",

Unlike its predecessor, AlphaFold 3 can model not only proteins but also DNA, RNA, and small molecule interactions. This release is set to transform the fields of structural biology, drug discovery, and synthetic biology.\nThe newly released AlphaFold 3 pipeline allows scientists and engineers to predict complex molecular assemblies with unprecedented accuracy. This includes protein-ligand binding, nucleic acid interactions, and even multi-protein complexes ‚Äî tasks that were previously the domain of expensive wet-lab experimentation.\nWhat makes AlphaFold 3 particularly exciting for developers is the modular and Python-accessible architecture. Bioinformaticians, AI researchers, and biotech engineers can now directly integrate these models into their workflows, accelerating everything from target identification to molecule design. The fusion of machine learning and biology has never been more seamless.\nAs AI continues to unlock new frontiers in life sciences, AlphaFold 3 sets the stage for a future where protein design and therapeutic discovery can be driven by open, programmable, and intelligent systems.\nhttps://github.com/deepmind/alphafold\nhttps://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphafold-3-predicting-the-shape-and-interactions-of-everything-protein",

          "description": "NVIDIA has just announced native support for Python in its CUDA platform, marking a major shift in how developers can access GPU acceleration. For the first time, Python developers can write CUDA programs without needing to rely on C or C++ bindings. This native integration drastically lowers the barrier for using GPUs in scientific computing, AI, and data-heavy Python applications.\nThe new cuda-python package gives direct access to CUDA‚Äôs driver and runtime APIs, letting users launch kernels, manage memory, and control streams entirely from Python. It also includes support for just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which means you can write dynamic GPU code directly in Python, compile it on the fly, and run it immediately.\nA key innovation is the new CuTile programming model, which brings a tile-based structure to CUDA operations. CuTile is designed to feel natural to Python users familiar with NumPy and CuPy, and it allows for efficient manipulation of large data arrays without needing to manage threads manually.\nThis move brings CUDA closer to Python‚Äôs ecosystem and could reshape how GPU computing is taught, deployed, and scaled across AI and HPC workloads.\nRead the full announcement here:\nhttps://thenewstack.io/nvidia-finally-adds-native-python-support-to-cuda/\nOfficial documentation from NVIDIA:\nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-python",

After over a year of updates in the React 18.x line, React 19 solidifies the groundwork with innovations aimed at simplifying component logic, improving server-side rendering, and streamlining form handling.\nIn this blog, we‚Äôll explore the most important features of React 19 and how they impact modern frontend development.\nüî• 1. Actions for Forms: Server-first Data Mutations\n‚úÖ Benefits:\nServer and client logic remain in sync.\nSimplifies the mental model for forms.\nüß™ Example:\nexport async function createPost(formData) {\nCreate Post\nüß† 2. useOptimistic: Better UX for Async Updates\nüöÄ Use Case:\nüí° Example:\n{\n    addOptimisticTodo({ title: inputValue });\nüîÑ 3. useFormStatus and useFormState: Form Helpers\nuseFormStatus\njsx\njsx\nüåê 4. Improved Server Components\nüíº Key Benefits:\nImproved initial load performance.\nEnhanced support in Next.js App Router and other frameworks.\nüì¶ 5. Asset Loading with \nWhy it matters:\nNative  support in JSX means tighter integration with the browser's preload pipeline.\njsx\nüßπ 7. Cleanup and Breaking Changes\nLegacy context API (pre-React 16.3) is fully removed.\nReactDOM.render is now replaced with createRoot.\nBetter error boundaries and async rendering behavior.\nüìà Final Thoughts\nWhether you're building SPAs or full-stack apps with frameworks like Next.js or Remix, React 19 is ready to supercharge your developer experience.\nüôå Ready to Migrate?\nReact 19 is now stable, and most major frameworks have either added or are adding support. Start experimenting today, especially with server actions and useFormState, to see the benefits in real-time.",

While AI promises innovation and efficiency, it also presents significant challenges that require urgent attention.\nUp to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs risk displacement due to automation, with unemployment potentially rising to 20%, a rate not seen since the Great Depression (Anthropic CEO Dario Amod).\nCurrently, 14% of the global workforce‚Äîapproximately 375 million workers‚Äîhave been affected by AI through job losses or career changes, with around 5 million jobs lost worldwide.\nThe most impacted sectors include customer service (1.2 million jobs lost), IT services (850,000), warehousing and logistics (1.1 million), administrative and clerical roles (750,000), banking (400,000), and retail (300,000).\nWomen‚Äôs jobs are disproportionately vulnerable, with 41% of female roles at risk compared to 28% for men, reflecting the higher concentration of women in automatable sectors.\nAttempts by companies like Clara and IBM to fully replace human roles with AI have demonstrated the limitations of automation, highlighting the continued importance of human skills.\nLooking ahead, by 2026, AI is projected to displace 75 million jobs globally but create 133 million new jobs, emphasizing a shift toward roles requiring new and different skills.\nThis transition risks exacerbating inequality, favoring those with greater education and resources, and posing a challenge for inclusive economic growth.\nThe path forward requires coordinated action:\nAccelerated workforce retraining and upskilling programs\nThoughtful regulation of AI adoption\nStrategic planning to ensure equitable opportunities in the evolving job market\nAs AI continues to evolve, organizations and governments must collaborate to create a future of work that balances innovation with inclusivity and social responsibility.\nHow is your organization preparing for the impact of AI on jobs?",

CI/CD-driven tooling then consumes the files to automatically create and update your resources.\nHere's the GitOps workflow in a nutshell:\n\nGitOps increases¬†development velocity¬†while guarding against the mistakes that can occur when DevOps teams directly interact with infrastructu‚Ä¶",

          "description": "No artigo de hoje, vamos falar sobre uma pr√°tica da qual eu j√° fui v√≠tima, e voc√™, leitor, provavelmente tamb√©m j√° foi (ou ainda est√° sendo).\nTrata-se da famigerada pr√°tica de criar endpoints excessivamente verbosos. Quando estamos desenvolvendo uma API REST para nosso sistema, √© comum tentarmos facilitar o acesso a dados muito espec√≠ficos. No entanto, isso muitas vezes se transforma em uma bola de neve.\nQuem nunca se pegou pensando: ‚ÄúS√≥ mais um endpoint e tudo estar√° resolvido‚Äù... e repetiu isso incont√°veis vezes?\nIsso acontece porque ignoramos um fator muito importante no conceito de API: ela deve servir como um portal de acesso aos recursos gerais do sistema, e n√£o como um grande servidor repleto de rotas altamente espec√≠ficas para cada situa√ß√£o.\nEsse problema costuma surgir, principalmente, quando lidamos com recursos que est√£o relacionados entre si.\nPense na seguinte situa√ß√£o:\nVoc√™ precisa listar usu√°rios que possuem tarefas atribu√≠das. A abordagem comum e tentadora √© criar um endpoint como:\n/getUsersWithTasks\nMas esse tipo de design fere princ√≠pios fundamentais de uma API bem constru√≠da. Em vez disso, pense na sua API como uma interface para recursos, e usu√°rios s√£o um recurso. Logo, uma forma mais adequada e escal√°vel seria algo como:\n/users?withTasks=true\nEsse formato segue o padr√£o REST, √© mais flex√≠vel e permite expandir facilmente os filtros no futuro, como:\n/users?withTasks=true&active=true\nEvite criar endpoints com verbos como get, delete ou create. Al√©m de quebrar os princ√≠pios REST, isso torna sua API redundante e desnecessariamente verbosa. Por exemplo:\nüö´ /getUserById\nAl√©m disso:\nPrefira filtros via query parameters em vez de encher a URL com par√¢metros.\nMantenha seus endpoints focados em recursos, n√£o em a√ß√µes.\nSeguindo essas dicas simples, sua API se tornar√° muito mais limpa, intuitiva, escal√°vel e f√°cil de manter.",

          "description": "Google, founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, has become one of the most influential technology companies in history. Originally launched as a search engine, Google transformed how people access and interact with information online.\nAt the heart of Google's success is its powerful search algorithm, which ranks web pages based on relevance and authority. This innovation not only made Google the go-to search engine globally but also revolutionized the digital marketing industry through platforms like Google Ads and Google Analytics.\nOver the years, Google expanded far beyond search. It developed the Android operating system, now the most widely used mobile OS, acquired YouTube to dominate online video, and introduced Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome, and the Google Workspace suite. Each of these tools became a cornerstone of modern digital life.\nThe company‚Äôs parent organization, Alphabet Inc., was created in 2015 to oversee a broader range of ventures, including artificial intelligence (DeepMind), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), and life sciences (Verily). Google continues to lead in AI, with products like Google Assistant and its recent work on generative AI models.\nHowever, Google's dominance has also sparked concerns over privacy, market monopoly, and data ethics. Antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. and abroad highlight the tension between innovation and regulation in the digital era.\nToday, Google remains a symbol of innovation and connectivity, shaping how billions of people learn, communicate, and do business. Whether it‚Äôs through search, cloud computing, or AI, Google's impact on the modern world is profound and enduring.",

It uses analytics and machine learning to recognize routine activity, then identifies anomalies that could indicate a threat. These could include unexpected logins, large data transfers, or system access at odd hours.\nInstead of following static security rules, UEBA adjusts dynamically. It connects various data points across your environment, helping security teams understand when something suspicious may be occurring, even if it appears harmless in isolation.\nLegacy security solutions are typically reactive and rule-driven. They are effective against known threats but often miss new or subtle ones. UEBA fills this gap by ‚Ä¶",

They‚Äôre TradFi in a blockchain costume.\nHere‚Äôs the inconvenient truth:\nWant to buy tokenized real estate? Great. But that token doesn‚Äôt give you squat unless a legal entity off-chain honors it.\nTreasury tokens? Same thing. You‚Äôre trusting a fund manager, custodian, or regulatory body to redeem it.\nIt‚Äôs not trustless. It‚Äôs regulatory theater with a smart contract backend.\nRWAs are less about empowering users and more about navigating global compliance.\nIt‚Äôs not about breaking the system. It‚Äôs about bending the rules just enough to extract value while pretending to be futuristic.\nThis isn‚Äôt DeFi. It‚Äôs just TradFi with faster accounting.\nLet‚Äôs be honest: most RWA projects don‚Äôt need a blockchain. They use it for:\nToken issuance\nCap table management\nTracking asset flow\nBut these are things spreadsheets and CRMs have done for decades.\nPutting it onchain doesn‚Äôt make it revolutionary ‚Äî it just makes it buzzword-compliant.\nWeb3 wasn‚Äôt about rehypothecating bonds or making banks more efficient. It was about disintermediation.\nCutting out the middlemen. Giving power back to users. Trustless systems.\nRWAs? They reintroduce the middlemen ‚Äî they just wear hoodies now.\nTokenized RWAs sound sexy, but they‚Äôre just Wall Street playing dress-up in Web3.\nUntil these assets are truly decentralized ‚Äî not just onchain ‚Äî they‚Äôll remain more TradFi than DeFi.",

This means projects can move a lot faster, and teams aren't stuck in that slow back-and-forth process. It's like having a super-fast assistant that understands design and can write code.

Scalar context means that the function is expected to return a single value, while list context means that the function is expected to return a list of values.\nIn XS, list context is a bit more complex than scalar context. When a function is called in list context, it can return multiple values, so in XS you need to push each value onto the stack.

As a \"divide and conquer\" algorithm, it works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around it. Unlike Merge Sort, which always divides arrays exactly in half, Quick Sort's divisions depend on the chosen pivot.\nQuick Sort offers average-case time complexity of O(n log n) with in-place sorting capability, requiring only O(log n) additional memory for the recursion stack.

          "description": "There‚Äôs something special about the first programming language you learn. For many developers, it becomes a nostalgic memory ‚Äî one tied to discovery, frustration, creativity, and the thrill of solving problems for the first time. Whether it was the blinking cursor of a BASIC interpreter, a Python ‚ÄúHello, World,‚Äù or writing HTML in a notepad file, that first step into code often shapes how we see technology and continue to learn it.\nSo, let‚Äôs talk about it:\nWhat was your first programming language, and what got you started with it?\nMaybe it was a class assignment, a YouTube tutorial, a book someone gave you, or pure curiosity. Some of us started with languages that are now considered ‚Äúold school,‚Äù while others dove in through newer, high-level languages designed to be beginner-friendly. Some were drawn in by game modding, others by web development, and some just wanted to automate tedious tasks.\nAnd how do you feel about that first language now? Was it a good starting point? Would you recommend it to beginners today, or do you wish you‚Äôd started with something else?\nShare your story in the comments below.\nI‚Äôd love to hear what language kicked off your programming journey!",

One approach to achieve this is by using containerization with Docker. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of using containerized Java microservices and provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement this architecture.\nIdentify the microservices: Break down your application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately.\nChoose a containerization platform: Select a suitable containerization platform, such as Docker, and install it on your development environment.\nCreate a Dockerfile: Write a Dockerfile that defines the instructions for building and running your microservice.\nBuild and run the container: Use the Dockerfile to build a Docker image and run the container.\nIntegrate with other services: Integrate the containerized microservice with other services in your application.\nBy following these steps, you can design a scalable and maintainable Java microservice architecture using containerization with Docker.

By sampling DNA from some of the planet‚Äôs most remote and untouched ecosystems, the company has identified over one million previously unknown species. These discoveries are not just academic. They are fueling a next-generation AI platform designed to radically accelerate drug discovery.\nThe company‚Äôs genomic database is already among the largest of its kind. It is being used to train AI models that predict protein structures, functions, and interactions at unprecedented accuracy. This includes boosting tools like AlphaFold, which helps researchers visualize the shape of proteins based on genetic code alone.\nA major focus of the project is the identification of new large serine recombinases, a type of enzyme that can precisely insert large DNA sequences into the genome. These enzymes are considered highly promising for future gene therapies, including for cancer and rare genetic disorders.\nBasecamp Research is also trying to set a new standard in ethical science. The team works directly with local researchers and governments in the regions where DNA samples are collected. In return, partner countries receive royalties and scientific credit, avoiding the extractive models of earlier biotech ventures.\nThis combination of field biology, advanced sequencing, and deep learning could reshape how we find drugs, understand evolution, and build genetic tools. It is a powerful example of how AI, when paired with real-world data, can help uncover the deepest layers of life on Earth.\nRead the full story here:\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/9765ab86-0156-4901-b6ec-fbee465ab819",

          "description": "Sure! Here's a simple and beginner-friendly blog post about learning arrays and length in programming. This example is based on JavaScript, but I can adapt it to another language if you prefer.\nIf you're just starting your programming journey, two important concepts you'll often hear are arrays and length. Let‚Äôs break them down in a simple way.\nAn array is a way to store multiple values in a single variable.\nlet fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"];\n\nHere, fruits is an array that holds 3 values:\n\"apple\"\n\"banana\"\n\"cherry\"\nYou can think of an array like a box with compartments. Each compartment has a number (called an index), and it holds one item.\n\n\n\nIndex\nValue\n\n\n\n\n0\n\"apple\"\n\n\n1\n\"banana\"\n\n\n2\n\"cherry\"\n\n\n\nüß† Remember: Indexes start at 0, not 1.\nWant to get \"banana\"? You use its index:\nconsole.log(fruits[1]); // Output: banana\n\nEvery array has a property called length, which tells you how many items are inside.\nconsole.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3\n\nEven if you don‚Äôt know what's in the array, .length helps you find out how many items it contains.\nYou can add new items using .push() and remove with .pop():\nfruits.push(\"mango\"); // Adds \"mango\" to the end\nconsole.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"mango\"]\n\nfruits.pop(); // Removes the last item (\"mango\")\nconsole.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\nYou can loop through arrays using a for loop:\nfor (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {\n  console.log(fruits[i]);\n}\n\nAn array stores multiple values in one variable.\nYou access values using index numbers, starting from 0.\nUse .length to find how many items are in the array.\nArrays are super useful for organizing data and are used in almost every programming language!\nLet me know if you'd like this blog translated into Hindi, Tamil, or another language, or if you want examples in Python, Java, or C++.",

This allows us to reduce the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and parsed when the user first opens the app.\nA simple and widely used approach to code splitting is splitting by page. The logic is straightforward: when a user opens Page A, there‚Äôs no need to load the code for Page B at that moment. This approach provides a significant improvement in initial load time, which is especially important for large applications.\nHowever, like any solution, this method comes with trade-offs. While first-time loading becomes faster, navigating between pages can feel slower. When the user switches ‚Ä¶",

          "description": "In the world of Go development, unexpected situations can arise ‚Äì bugs, invalid inputs, or resource exhaustion. When these critical errors occur, Go has a built-in mechanism called panic to signal that something unrecoverable has happened. However, simply letting your program crash isn't the most user-friendly or robust approach.\nThis is where the powerful duo of defer and recover comes into play. They provide a way to intercept and handle panics gracefully, allowing your program to potentially clean up resources, log the error, and even continue execution (in specific scenarios).\nLet's dive into each of these concepts with clear, practical examples.\npanic\n\n\nA panic in Go is a runtime error that stops the normal execution flow of the current goroutine.

Imagine two equally skilled engineers at the start of their careers ‚Äî one who strategically maps out a clear pathway, and another who takes opportunities as they randomly appear. Five years later, who is likely to be more satisfied, more advanced, and more successful?\n‚Ä¶",

Think of it as C meets Python, but optimized to fly through code in under 1000 nanoseconds per execution ‚Äî seriously.\nModern languages have a lot of power, but also a lot of bloat. I wanted something that felt like writing in pure logic, no distractions. That‚Äôs how K2 was born.\nK2 doesn‚Äôt interpret every time. It caches, then executes from RAM. That means:\nFirst run compiles ‚Üí cache\n\nNext runs ‚Üí instant execution\n\nlet x = 10;\nExecution time? About 841 nanoseconds. No joke.\n‚úÖ Nanosecond execution time\nAnd soon: a full GUI framework called Nahir UI and native apps using Talanolius GUI.\nVisit üåê k2lang.org and start coding directly in the browser!\nOnline compiler, examples, docs ‚Äî everything you need to get started.\n\nExample: Fibonacci in K2\nfunc fib(n) {\nprint(fib(10)); // Output: 55\nThis runs in microseconds and showcases recursion and return logic beautifully.\nI built K2 for speed lovers, learners, and creative coders like you.\nüëâ Try it at k2lang.org\nüõ† Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è by a dev who just wants things to be FAST.",

In Part 1, we tackled the initial frustration of panic: test timed out with SetReadDeadline and channels for client handlers. In Part 2, we dove into the complexities of concurrent testing, taming the broadcaster with sync.WaitGroup and proper shared state management.\nNow, we're bringing it all together by looking at common utility functions and the crucial server initialization process. These areas often present their own unique testing challenges, from ensuring file operations are robust to making sure your server starts up reliably every single time.

Spoiler: It‚Äôs not favoritism‚Äîit‚Äôs about async value generation, not database calls. Let‚Äôs break it down.\nAddAsync() does NOT talk to your database. Nope, not even a little. When you write:\nawait db.Users.AddAsync(user);  \n\nZero bytes hit the database. All it does is tell EF: \"Track this new entity; insert it later when I save.\" The actual INSERT happens at SaveChangesAsync().  \nSo why Async? ü§î  \nImagine your entity needs a unique ID before saving, like a distributed Snowflake ID from an external service:\npublic class Order\n{\n    public long Id { get; set; } // Generated by a fancy async service!\n    public string Customer { get; set; }\n}\n\nYou‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Great! You're learning JavaScript, especially about local variables and the DOM (Document Object Model)‚Äîthose are essential concepts in web development.\nHere's a simple blog-style explanation to help reinforce your learning:\nIn JavaScript, a local variable is a variable that is declared inside a function or block, and it can only be used within that function or block.\nfunction greet() {\n    let message = \"Hello, world!\";\n    console.log(message);\n}\n\ngreet(); // Outputs: Hello, world!\nconsole.log(message); // ‚ùå Error! 'message' is not defined outside the function\n\nlet message = \"Hello, world!\" is a local variable, so you cannot use it outside the greet() function.\nDOM stands for Document Object Model. It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects in JavaScript.\nWith the DOM, you can:\nRead or change content\nChange styles (CSS)\nAdd or remove HTML elements\n<p id=\"demo\">Original Text</p>\n<button onclick=\"changeText()\">Click Me</button>\n\n<script>\nfunction changeText() {\n    let element = document.getElementById(\"demo\");\n    element.innerHTML = \"Text has been changed!\";\n}\n</script>\n\nWhen the button is clicked:\nJavaScript finds the <p> tag with id=\"demo\"\n\nChanges its content to \"Text has been changed!\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  üõ†Ô∏è Why It Matters\n\n\n\n\nLocal variables help avoid bugs by keeping variables where they belong.\nThe DOM lets you make web pages interactive‚Äîlike showing messages, changing colors, or responding to clicks.\nWould you like a small project to practice with these concepts?",

Types in JavaScript\nJavaScript supports several data types, which can be grouped into two categories:\nThese are the basic types:\nString: Text. Example: \"Hello\"\n\nNumber: Numeric values. Example: 42, 3.14\n\nBoolean: true or false\n\nNull: A deliberate non-value\n\nUndefined: A variable that has been declared but not assigned\n\nSymbol: Unique values (advanced)\n\nBigInt: Large integers (new in ES2020)\n\nlet name = \"Sivasankari\";      // String\nüî∏ Non-Primitive Types\nObject\n\nArray\n\nFunction\n\nlet person = { name: \"Sivasankari\", age: 23 };  // Object\nüß™ 2. Variables in JavaScript\nVariables store data values. In modern JavaScript, we use:\nlet: Block-scoped variable (preferred)\n\nconst: Block-scoped, constant value\n\nvar: Function-scoped (older and less recommended)\n\nlet city = \"Coimbatore\";\nüîß 3. Functions in JavaScript\nFunctions are reusable blocks of code that perform a task. Here's how to declare and use them:\nfunction greet() {\ngreet(); // Call the function\nParameters and Arguments\nfunction greetUser(name) {\ngreetUser(\"Alice\");  // Output: Hello, Alice!\nüîó 4. Concatenation in JavaScript\nConcatenation means combining strings.\nlet firstName = \"Siva\";\nüéÅ 5. Return Statement\nThe return keyword gives back a result from a function.\nfunction add(a, b) {\nlet sum = add(10, 5);  // sum is 15\nIf you don't use return, the function will return undefined by default.\nüìû 6. Calling Functions\nOnce a function is defined, you can call or invoke it by using its name followed by parentheses ().\nfunction sayHello() {\nsayHello();  // Output: Hello!\nüèÅ Conclusion\nJavaScript is a powerful language, but understanding these fundamentals ‚Äî types, variables, functions, return statements, concatenation, and function calls ‚Äî is a solid first step.",

Type that letter before it hits the ground.\nIf you miss too many, your city starts to crumble...\nIt‚Äôs simple, addictive, and fun ‚Äî with a retro vibe and an educational twist.\nüîó Play Now: https://playhvn.itch.io/alpha-bomb\nBy Studio: PlayHvn\nüõ†Ô∏è How I Built It (Using Godot!)\nAs a huge fan of open-source engines, I chose Godot for this project ‚Äî and it was a blast! Here are some behind-the-scenes highlights:\nüí° Typing Mechanics\nUsing InputEventKey in Godot, I mapped each falling bomb‚Äôs letter to real-time keyboard inputs. This gave the game a responsive and satisfying feel ‚Äî every keystroke is a mini victory.\nüéØ Collision & Timing\nEach bomb is a node that tracks its vertical movement. If it reaches the bottom and hasn't been typed, the game deducts health from the city. Managing performance with dozens of bombs onscreen taught me a lot about optimization and pooling.\nüîä Sound & Feedback\nI used subtle sound cues and explosions to reward correct typing, and dramatic screen shakes when the city takes damage.

This subtle but powerful change can make your code more versatile and easier to use.\nIn this blog post, we‚Äôll explore why writing functions over slices is often preferable to writing functions over concrete collections like Vec.

          "description": "Another Wednesday, another mini-tutorial!\n\n\nToday, we‚Äôre doing something super practical: adding a QR code to your website. Because sometimes, sharing a link the old-school way just doesn‚Äôt cut it.\nQuick answer: they‚Äôre easy, mobile-friendly and just cool. QR codes let users scan and go; they could scan a contact form, app download or your portfolio link,\n<div class=\"card\">\n  <h1>Scan Me!</h1>\n  <div id=\"qrcode\"></div>\n</div>\n\nThat‚Äôs your placeholder. Now let‚Äôs generate the actual QR code.\nWe‚Äôll use a popular lightweight library called QRCode.js. You can include it via CDN:\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/qrcodejs/qrcode.min.js\"></script>\n\nNow generate the QR code and target the #qrcode div:\nconst qrcode = new QRCode(document.getElementById(\"qrcode\"), {\n  text: \"https://your-link-here.com\",\n  width: 128,\n  height: 128,\n  colorDark: \"#000000\",\n  colorLight: \"#ffffff\",\n  correctLevel: QRCode.CorrectLevel.H\n});\n\nReplace the text value with the link you want users to scan.\nHere‚Äôs a little CSS to centre the QR code and keep things neat:\nbody {\n  font-family: sans-serif;\n  background-color: #f4f4f4;\n  color: #333;\n  display: flex;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n.card {\n  background: #ffffff;\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n  padding: 2rem;\n  width: 300px;\n    display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}\n\n#qrcode {\n  margin-top: 1rem;\n}\n\nFeel free to customise it, round corners, borders, drop shadows, etc...\nYou now have a working QR code on your site!\nCheck it out in this Codepen\nLet users generate QR codes dynamically by typing a URL and clicking a button. Wanna see that next Wednesday? Let me know!\nFollow me to see more straight-forward and short tutorials like this :)",

Let‚Äôs break it down simply.\nüìå Datatypes:\nJavaScript has different types of data you can work with. The most common are:\n‚Ä¢ String‚Üí text ‚Üí \"Hello World\"\nNumber ‚Üí numbers ‚Üí 42, 3.14\nBoolean ‚Üí true/false ‚Üí true, false\nUndefined‚Üí no value assigned\nNull ‚Üí intentionally empty\nObject ‚Üí key-value pairs ‚Üí {name: \"Alex\"}\nArray‚Üí list of items ‚Üí [1, 2, 3]\n‚Æû Example:\nlet name = \"Alex\"; // string\nlet age = 25; // number\nlet isStudent = true; // boolean\n\nüìå Variables:\nWe store data in variables. In modern JS, we mostly use:\n‚Ä¢let ‚Üí value can change\nconst‚Üí value cannot change (constant)\n‚Æû Example:\nlet city = \"New York\";\ncity = \"London\"; // this works\n\nconst country = \"USA\";\n// country = \"Canada\"; // ‚ùå error\n\nüìå Functions\nA function is a reusable block of code that performs a task.\n‚Æû Example:\nfunction greet() {\n    console.log(\"Hello!\");\n}\n\nWe call or invoke a function like this:\ngreet(); // Output: Hello!\n\nüìå Return & Arguments\nFunctions can take arguments (inputs) and return outputs.\n‚Æû Example:\nfunction add(a, b) {\n    return a + b;\n}\n\nlet sum = add(5, 3); // sum = 8\nconsole.log(sum); // Output: 8\n\nüìå String Concatenation\nWe combine (concatenate) strings using +.\n‚Æû Example:\nlet firstName = \"Alex\";\nlet lastName = \"Smith\";\nlet fullName = firstName + \" \" + lastName;\nconsole.log(fullName); // Output: Alex Smith\n\nüöÄQuick Recap\n‚úî Datatypes help define the kind of data.\nVariablesstore data.\nFunctions let us organize reusable logic.\nArguments & returnallow input and output.\nConcatenation connects strings.\nThat‚Äôs a wrap for Session 2!\nThanks for reading ‚Äî happy coding! ‚ú®",

His screen was the only one lit up, and we‚Äôd play a Flash game called Hangaroo‚Äîa Hangman clone where you had to guess the word before the kangaroo met its fate!

          "description": "The Australian Army is currently trialling an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) system named TrapRadio, designed to generate deceptive radio communications to mislead adversaries and enhance frontline protection. Developed by British-Australian company Penten Amio, TrapRadio employs AI to create synthetic radio traffic that mimics high-value communications or transmission patterns, effectively diverting enemy attention and resources away from actual operations.\nThis technology mirrors cybersecurity strategies where decoy systems and data are used to distract threat actors. TrapRadio was recently tested during a large-scale international military exercise in California, involving 140 Australian Defence Force personnel. The system demonstrated its capability to support soldiers through force protection and by creating dilemmas for adversaries via AI-generated deceptions. \nCaptain Wayne Mulhall from the Electronic Warfare division at Army Headquarters highlighted TrapRadio's potential to reshape the battlefield by mimicking high-value targets, thereby creating strategic dilemmas for enemy operators. This initiative underscores the Australian Defence Force's commitment to integrating cutting-edge AI technologies to enhance operational effectiveness and soldier safety.\nCatch the entire article right here: https://www.itnews.com.au/news/defence-trials-ai-radiocomms-deception-technology-617434",

You can send yourself reminders, check in on your goals, and maybe benefit from the perspective of listening to your past self. In an age where bots are everywhere, it's nice to be able to have a human connection with yourself. Not to mention the fact that you can actually do a bit of time travelling, which is awesome. \nYou can send an email to hello@dearme.email and it will be sent back to you in 30 days. We encrypt the email on our end, decrypt it when it's time to send it back and then we delete the message from our systems. We do demand that you varify your email. If you don't do that within 30 days we delete the message.\nIt's a fairly basic Python/postgres setup with Flask. Postmark really takes care of most of the hard bits here. There's a webhook and a cronjob too, but nothing too fancy. \nI might add payments later to help cover the postgres costs, which I'll probably build with lemonsqueezy.

Instead of typing in a password I used a key pair ‚Äì a public key stored on the server and a private key saved safely on my computer.\nTo connect to AWS instance I followed below steps using PuTTY on Windows.\nWhat I Used:\nA running EC2 instance on AWS\nA .ppt key pair that I downloaded when launching the instance\nPuTTY installed on my PC.\nI opened PuTTY.\nIn the Host Name field, I entered the public IP of my EC2 instance (from the AWS console).\nUnder Connection ‚Üí SSH ‚Üí Auth, I browsed and selected my .ppk file.\nI clicked Open to start the session.\nWhen prompted for a username, I used ec2-user for Amazon Linux\nPuTTY is lightweight and easy to use. It helps me:\nSave sessions for quick connections\nUse terminal commands like I would on a Linux server\nLearning how to connect to AWS EC2 instances using SSH and PuTTY has been a valuable experience. It helped me understand the basics of secure server management and gives me hands-on practice in cloud computing.",

That's thanks to tiled image rendering.\nI recently built a tool called tilegen, which is essentially a tile generator that slices up a high-res image into thousands of tiles across multiple zoom levels, just like Google Maps does (well, almost). This post is a deep dive into what tilegen is, how it works, the quirks I ran into, and how mapping giants like Google do it too.\nAt its core, tilegen takes a massive image (like a satellite photo, map scan, game world, or giant illustration), and cuts it into 256√ó256 PNG tiles across zoom levels. These tiles can then be loaded on demand by a viewer, allowing users to pan and zoom without downloading gigabytes of image data up front.\nüßµ Multi-threaded tile generation u‚Ä¶",

          "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally reshaping the software development landscape. Its impact is both groundbreaking and complex‚Äîoffering unprecedented productivity boosts while introducing new challenges that developers must navigate thoughtfully.\nThe Positive Side: Supercharged Productivity and Innovation\nFor startups and solo developers, AI lowers the barrier to entry, allowing smaller teams to build powerful applications that would have previously required large development resources. It's also enabling innovation in fields like healthcare, education, and finance by automating complex data analysis and modeling tasks.\nThe Negative Side: Dependency and Ethical Dilemmas\nEthically, concerns around data privacy, model bias, and job displacement must be addressed. As AI takes over more tasks, companies must ensure that developers are not just users but also ethical stewards of these powerful tools.\nConclusion\n@alx_africa",
