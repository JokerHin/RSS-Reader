If you restart or shut down, all the info in RAM is cleared. \nWhereas ROM (Read Only Memory) stores memory permanently. We rarely interact with ROM.

I was in a dilemma about choosing a framework— it needed to be powerful enough to handle the peak trading at the end of the semester, and its syntax had to be simple so that I, as a Rust newbie, could get up to speed quickly. To my pleasant surprise, Hyperlane exceeded all my expectations. Today, I want to share my experience with this amazing framework!\nWhen I first started writing route functions, I was amazed by Hyperlane’s Context (or ctx for short).

          "description": "GraphQL has emerged as a modern alternative to RESTful APIs, offering a more flexible and efficient way for clients to query data. Unlike REST, where clients often make multiple requests to different endpoints and receive fixed response structures, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need — and nothing more — in a single round trip. This reduces the issues of over-fetching and under-fetching common in REST, and gives frontend developers more control over the shape of the response.\nAWS AppSync is a managed service that helps developers build scalable, real-time GraphQL APIs with minimal operational overhead. It integrates seamlessly with various AWS data sources, including DynamoDB, Lambda, RDS, and OpenSearch, and supports features such as offline access, subscriptions,…",

But growing a product or brand also requires effective outreach—whether it’s for link building, partnership development, or community growth.\nAs an outreach specialist, I’ve seen how developers can level up their impact by integrating outreach best practices with their technical skills.\nHere are some practical outreach strategies tailored for devs:\nUse tools and APIs (like Hunter.io, Clearbit, or LinkedIn APIs) to gather prospect data quickly. Automate personalized email sequences with tools like Mailshake, Lemlist, or custom scripts.\nInstead of generic messages, pull in specific details (like a recent blog post, GitHub project, or tweet) to tailor your outreach and boost reply rates.\nIf you’re into SEO, tiered link building can amplify your backlinks’ power. Use automation cautiously and always prioritize quality at every tier.\nParticipate authentically in forums, Slack groups, or Discord servers related to your niche. Share helpful content and build real relationships before pitching.\nTrack open rates, reply rates, and conversions. Use this data to improve your messaging and target the right contacts.\nOutreach isn’t just a marketing skill—it’s a growth lever developers can master to help their projects gain visibility and traction.\nWhat outreach tools or strategies have you found effective as a developer?

It was a difficult but necessary reset.\nThe new flow feels much more aligned with the story I want the page to tell.\nStep 4.5: Information architecture & content prioritization  \nThis step ended up being naturally integrated into Step 4 during the restructuring. With that handled, I moved on to Step 5.\nStep 5: Copywriting\nI wrote all core copy for the new layout. Headlines, subheads, and body content.\nTo make the tone feel more rooted in the region, I experimented with adding local dialect terms from the farming area. It’s subtle, but I think it adds a sense of personality and authenticity.\nCompared to my initial draft, this version feels more alive, more honest, more me. That’s always a good sign.\nReflections\nRewriting structure mid-way costs time and I was lucky this was a personal project.\nIf this were a real client project with a tight deadline, the reset would’ve been dangerous.\nI’m reminded how critical it is to lock purpose and user goals before building layout.\nAlso the more I write and build for this farm, the more affection I feel for them.\n\n\n\nThat’s the magic of creative work. It turns research into care.\nNext Step\nStep 6: Design (desktop/mobile)\nLet’s keep building!\nDate: June 10, 2025\ntags: portfolio,,webdev,,copywriting,,ux,,learning",

This flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to remotely read arbitrary files from the server—no user interaction required.\nIf you’re using Apache Kafka Connect or systems that integrate it (like Apache Druid), you need to patch ASAP.\nKafka Connect’s vulnerability comes from insecure handling of two configuration parameters:\nsasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url\nsasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url\nThese were not properly sanitized. By crafting malicious URLs, attackers can trigger arbitrary file reads or even perform SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).\nArbitrary File Read: Attackers can access sensitive files on the server, including credentials and config files.\nNo authentication required\nWorks under default configuration\nHigh risk, easy to exploit\nImpacts remote systems over the network\nApache Kafka: 3.1.0 – 3.9.0\n\nDon’t expose Kafka Connect directly to the internet.\nIn standalone mode, check and restrict the following:\n\n\n\nconnect-standalone.properties: listeners, rest.host.name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn distributed mode:\n\n\n\nconnect-distributed.properties: listeners, rest.host.name\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse a Web Application Firewall (like SafeLine) or firewall rules to block suspicious requests to /connectors with file paths.\nApache has released version 3.9.1, which addresses this issue.

Now, teams focus on:\nDefect leakage rate\nTime to detect & time to fix\nTest coverage for critical business flows\nFlakiness & stability of automation suites\n📊 Real metrics drive real quality.\nTesters are no longer the gatekeepers — they’re collaborators.\n👏 The best testers today act as user champions, not just bug hunters.\nSoftware testing in 2025 is strategic, continuous, and collaborative.\nLet’s stop treating QA as a checkbox and start recognizing it as the core of software excellence.\n💬 How are you modernizing your testing process?

But MongoDB is not storing JSON. It’s storing BSON—a binary format designed for efficient storage and fast traversal.\nBSON (Binary JSON) is more than just a binary version of JSON. It introduces additional data types like ObjectId, Decimal128, and Timestamp, allowing MongoDB to handle more complex data structures and ensure data integrity. While we might rarely interact with raw BSON directly, understanding how MongoDB stores and processes BSON documents can help us write more efficient queries, handle data conversions properly, and debug unexpected behavior.\nIn this guide, we’ll take a look at some of BSON’s key concepts, how it maps to Java type…",

Static Type System: The Compile-Time Security Guard\n\n\nIf programming languages are analogous to natural languages, dynamic typing is like \"handwritten shorthand\"—fast but prone to scribbled errors—while static typing resembles \"printed text\": standardized and rigorous, though requiring upfront structuring. As the core development language for HarmonyOS 5, Cangjie chooses a static type system as its security foundation.\nIn Cangjie, the types of all variables and expressions are determined at compile time. Take this simple addition function, for example:\nfunc add(x: Int8, y: Int8) -> Int8 {  \n    return x + y  \n}  \n\nIf you attempt to pass string parameters like add(\"1\", \"2\"), the compiler will throw an error immediately, rather than letting the program crash at runtime.

The revolutionary interface will revolutionise user interaction on Apple devices, presenting a more immersive, fluid, and intuitive experience than ever.\nWhat is Apple's New Liquid Glass UI?\n\n\nApple's Liquid Glass UI is said to combine real-time dynamic elements with sophisticated glass-like visuals, featuring ultra-smooth transitions, depth, and light reflections that resemble real glass. It's a departure from flat design to something more immersive and tactile.\nKey Features to Look Forward To:\nNext-Generation Visual Appearance: Liquid transitions and glow-like reflections will add more visual beauty to the UI.\nImproved Responsiveness: Closer touch feedback and quicker response times.\nDeeper Integration with AR: Flawless layering of UI with AR content for an integrated mixed-reality experience.\nBattery & Performance Optimisation: Even with the visual upgrades, Apple is targeting efficiency, taking advantage of its M-series chips.\nWhy It Matters:\n\n\nThis is more than a visual refresh — it's Apple restating its dominance in UX design. The liquid glass UI fits into Apple's broader move into spatial computing, perhaps laying the groundwork for next-generation hardware such as the Vision Pro and future iPhones.\nConclusion:\n\n\nApple's new liquid glass UI is a forward-thinking leap in design and functionality. As a developer, designer, or regular user, Apple's future ecosystem is set to be more interactive and visually appealing than ever.",

That’s where the CAST function comes in—it converts data types explicitly, cleanly, and consistently. Let’s look at how to use it effectively.\nCAST Examples\n\n\nString to Integer\nSELECT CAST('100' AS INT);\n\nFloat to INT\nSELECT CAST(42.69 AS SIGNED);\n\nINT to Decimal\nSELECT CAST(3 AS DECIMAL);\n\nString to Date\nSELECT CAST('2024-12-21' AS DATE);\n\nINT to String\nSELECT CAST(42 AS CHAR);\n\nBest Practices\n\n\n\nUse CAST when explicit conversion improves clarity.\nAvoid casting unless required—some conversions happen automatically.\nPrefer date-specific functions for formatting over generic casting.\nBe cautious with numeric rounding.\nFAQ\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Is CAST cross-database?\n\n\nYes, it follows the SQL standard.\nOnly compatible ones—check your DB docs.\nCAST is standard. CONVERT is SQL Server. :: is PostgreSQL-only.\nUsually returns NULL or triggers an error.\nConclusion\n\n\nSQL's CAST function is your go-to tool for converting values clearly and safely across database platforms.

Any device directly connected to the internet (such as your router) will have a public IP. When you open a website or email, your public IP is used to address your network on the internet.\nThese addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) from blocks allocated by regional internet registries (RIRs), which are overseen by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).\nClass D: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255\n✔ Private IPs are used in internal networks\nPublic: For sale\nCarrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), also known as Large-Scale NAT (LSN), is a network address translation (NAT) technique used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to mitigate the ongoing exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.\nCGNAT acts as an intermediary layer of NAT at the ISP level, allowing multiple customers to share a single public IPv4 address. Think of it like this:\nTraditional NAT (your home router): Your home router takes all the private IP addresses of devices within your home network (e.g., 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3) and translates them to a single public IP address that your ISP assigns to your router.\nCGNAT (ISP level): CGNAT goes a step further. It takes the \"public\" IP address that your home router receives (which, in a CGNAT setup, is a private IP address from the ISP's internal network) and translates it, along with the \"private\" IPs of hundreds or even thousands of other customers, to a single public IP address that is then used to access the internet.",

          "description": "Hey problem solvers! 🎯\nToday we’re tackling a fun and elegant problem from LeetCode — 3423: Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array. This one checks your understanding of array boundaries and circular behavior. Let’s break it down. 🔍\nYou're given a circular array nums, and your task is to find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements, where:\nThe first and last elements are also considered adjacent (because it's circular).\nYou return the maximum absolute difference between any two adjacent numbers.\nInput: nums = [1, 2, 4]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\n|1 - 2| = 1, |2 - 4| = 2, |4 - 1| = 3.\n3.\nThe array is circular, so both regular adjacent pairs and the pair between the last and first element must be considered.\nInitialize ans with |nums[0] - nums[n-1]|.\nIterate through the array and compute |nums[i] - nums[i+1]| for all valid i.\nReturn the maximum of all these values.\nclass Solution {\n public:\n  int maxAdjacentDistance(vector<int>& nums) {\n    int ans = abs(nums.front() - nums.back());\n\n    for (int i = 0; i + 1 < nums.size(); ++i)\n      ans = max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));\n\n    return ans;\n  }\n};\n\nvar maxAdjacentDistance = function(nums) {\n    let ans = Math.abs(nums[0] - nums[nums.length - 1]);\n\n    for (let i = 0; i + 1 < nums.length; ++i) {\n        ans = Math.max(ans, Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));\n    }\n\n    return ans;\n};\n\ndef maxAdjacentDistance(nums):\n    ans = abs(nums[0] - nums[-1])\n\n    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):\n        ans = max(ans, abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]))\n\n    return ans\n\nInput: nums = [1, 2, 4]\nOutput: 3\n\nInput: nums = [-5, -10, -5]\nOutput: 5\n\nInput: nums = [0, 100, -100]\nOutput: 200\n\nTime Complexity: O(n) — one pass through the array\nSpace Complexity: O(1) — constant extra space\n\nThis is a great warm-up problem to train your attention to edge conditions like circular connections. Simple logic and clean implementation go a long way here.\nIf this guide helped you, drop a ❤️ and follow for more beginner-friendly coding guides!\nHappy coding! 🚀",

          "description": "Hello, I want to let this community know about a cutting edge project I created earlier this year. \nI built an early stage demo of an advanced symbolic language and cognitive substrate for AI, called Nyreth. It was first published on github in April 2025 and I'm looking for developers and researchers to grab hold of this project and propel it into the future. It's a system that is ahead of its time but if you understand what it is and what it can become, now is the time to get involved.\nNyreth is a higher order reasoning framework that surpasses token based computation by using a custom made symbolic language comprised of glyphs. Each glyph is a symbolic unit characterised by a multi axial cognitive array. They are morphogenic, adaptive and tensor based.\nThe system has the capability to grow into a new form of machine cognition.\nI have released it as a hybrid open-closed source model for now. The core modules are protected with encryption but I may make it fully open source soon. I could have kept it private but I feel everyone should have access to this technology and play a role in helping it mature the right way. \nSymbolic, recursive AI will happen and is happening. Its effects will be profound. It is important that it be instilled with conscience and ethics.\nGo to https://nyreth.ai or https://github.com/Kosev-Lex/Nyreth-Origin\nto read more about the project.",

My LLM would often return incoherent or incomplete answers when queried on long documents. This was especially evident when a user asked about features in \"Milvus 2.4.13\"—the model couldn't semantically link the header in one chunk with the feature list in another.\nThat’s when I encountered Late Chunking, which flips the process: instead of chunking first and embedding later, it embeds the entire document upfront and then slices it using token-based annotations.

I love the idea of creating things people can actually see and use. My goal is to become a UI/UX developer, so front-end is my first step towards that dream.\nIn the First week of course, I got introduced to the core building blocks of the web:\n*HTML (HyperText Markup Language): *\n<h1>, <p>, <a>, <div>, etc.\n*CSS (Cascading Style Sheet): *\n*Basic layout techniques: *\nThese really helped me understand better:\nPractice the code by using pen and paper.\nReading my running notes often.\nWrite blogs what I actually leaned each day.\nNext week, I'll be diving deeper into:\nCreating a small project.\nUse Linux OS often for better understanding about Open-source.\nStart something new can feel overwhelming, especially in tech. But this first week showed me that ''Consistency is the key to Success''. Each day i learn something new, I'm one step closer to my goal.\nThanks for reading!\nFeel free to connect with me or drop your tips for beginners in the comments.",

The map shows every single leaf, twig, and blade of grass, overwhelming you with detail and making it impossible to find your way. This is similar to the challenge faced when working with high-dimensional data – datasets with numerous variables or features. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction is like creating a clearer, more manageable map, highlighting only the essential landmarks to guide you efficiently. It's a powerful technique in machine learning that simplifies complex data without losing crucial information.\nThis article will explore the fascinating world of unsupervised dimensionality reduction, explaining its core concepts, applications, and challenges in a clear and accessible way.\nUnderstanding the …",

It understands complex investment strategies and real-world scenarios. Ask things like:\n\n\n“Should I invest in Apple now?”\n\n“When should I enter this trade?”\nIf you’d rather wait, you can still register and you’ll receive an automatic notification when the app is fully launched.\nFor more updates about the project, visit my X account or the project's official account, where we also share predictions generated with Social.\nFinally, a question for you, reader:\n\nWould you be interested in weekly posts here sharing progress on the project and sneak peeks at upcoming features?\nI know this post may feel a little like an advertisement—and that’s because it is.\n\nThis is a bootstrapped project (which means I’m funding it myself), and I’m putting my heart and soul into it.\n\nIf you can give it a try or help spread the word, that would mean the world to me.",

It is quite humbling to think you are tech-savvy, then spending the next two hours trying to convert the percentages to integers. \nThis cordial spreadsheet holds the power to analyse, automate, model, present data, and, for the unfortunate, cause despair. One missing comma and you can't format the whole column in a dataset. Excel is excellent at data analysis, allowing users to explore trends, patterns, and outliers in datasets, which is particularly useful for departments such as sales, marketing, and finance to make informed forecasts.\nOne feature that stuck out to me was pivot tables. They are easy to navigate and are useful for grouping, filtering, and comparing different information across multiple capacities. Conditional formatting is another handy tool that highlights cells based on specific rules to gain targeted information, such as identifying underperforming sectors in a given field. The most exciting part is that with Excel, different tools can be used in combinations and permutations according to how much you know Excel.\nThe more I learn about Excel, the more I see data differently since structures and hidden relationships that went unnoticed are being revealed. Instead of feeling overwhelmed, you begin to ask better questions, and that is a fine indicator that you are engaging with data analytically for interpretation. Then, Excel becomes a lens to spot the missing links, or what escapes the untrained eye.",

It's not open-source just yet but soon as I polish the codebase.\nI was inspired by https://carbon.now.sh/ for sharing code snippets on social media but I wanted a tight integration with Github's Gists, a focus on embedding the code in posts like Markdown with access to the code.\nI thought I'd test out NuxtHub powered by Nuxt (Vue.js) and a tight integration with Cloudflare Pages/Workers and other solutions.\nSo I've run iteration after iteration (iteratively) as I hit walls. So firstly to highlight code you generally want a library like highlighter.js or what I went with Shiki\nThe first wall, you cannot upload every language and every theme on a free plan to cloudflare. So importing them will fail the deploy. \nThe languages are much more important, for some reason there is a hard fail in Shiki if a language is not found instead of falling back to plaintext.\nI eventually hacked this and loaded the CDN version with vue's useHead feature. to on demand require the correct languages.\nThe next hurdle was I wanted \"OG\" images or images to share and embed with posts. I tried NuxtHub/CloudFlare's browser api for on demand rendering but on the free plan it's not feasible.\nSo I went to trusty html2canvas It works really well with some caveats; which I hit. It does not render SVG backgrounds well, or complicated CSS3 gradients. to hack this I basically append a png background if screenshot is occurring, this happens only if the og:image hasn't been created/uploaded before.\nI hit some more walls that I will go into next post, I also solved the html2canvas issue.\nFeel free to checkout an example here https://gist-share.nuxt.dev/gist/9bd761223a76e148af576546cd1e3e93",

This is a massive step forward, but it comes with serious risk: Apple's review process is notoriously slow and strict — and we're building an app for kids, which adds another layer of complexity.\nWe’ve seen horror stories of reviews taking 2–3 weeks… and with less than 2 weeks left in the hackathon, any major delay could mean launching too late. So we spent the day triple-checking every detail:\n✅ COPPA compliance documentation\n✅ Privacy Policy and Terms of Service\n✅ Contact and Support info\n✅ Landing page polish\n✅ App Store metadata\n✅ Minimal but functional MVP\nIf this first version gets through, we can start pushing updates using Expo EAS without needing to resubmit every time. That’s the plan.\n\nWe also made major strides in story generation costs! We’re down from $3.00 to ~80 cents per story — nearly a 4x improvement. We achieved this through:\nCode refactors\nSmarter API usage\nLeveraging more efficient model calls\nEvery cent matters when scaling a business. This optimization brings us closer to a viable pricing model post-hackathon.\nAfter exploring several options for consistent, personalized image generation (including custom pipelines, DreamBooth, etc.), the winner is still: OpenAI Image Gen v1.\nIt’s fast, consistent, takes direction better than anything else, and crucially — doesn’t require hours of training per user.\nFor our needs (1 photo → immediate image gen with likeness), nothing else competes right now.\nThe push continues. App store submission is out of our hands for now… so tomorrow, we keep building and improving what we can control.\nLet’s get this thing across the finish line.\n– Josh & Daniel\nStory Hero\n\nWhat is Story Hero?\n\nTwitter/X\n\nDEV Blog",

This technique helps to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between a client and a server and intercepts the SSL certificate, allowing them to read and modify the data being transmitted.\nIn SSL pinning, the client is pre-configured with the expected SSL certificate or public key of the server. When the client establishes a connection with the server, it verifies the server’s certificate against the expected certificate or public key. If the certificates match, the connection is established, otherwise, the connection is terminated.\nThis…",

          "description": "In a recent SurrealDB Stream, we cracked open a foundational part of SurrealDB’s power: relationship modelling. From traditional record-to-record links to bidirectional references and Graph Edge metadata, we explored the many ways you can model connected data - clearly, scalably, and with performance in mind.\nHere’s what we covered, broken out by relationship type.\nOne of SurrealDB’s most powerful features is its ability to connect records without the need for JOINs or intermediate tables. At the heart of this is the Record Link: a direct pointer from one record to another using the built-in table:id syntax.\nCREATE person:jaime SET friends = [person:tobie, person:simon];\nSELECT friends.name FROM person:jaime;\n\nThis isn’t a foreign key - it’s better.

To put it simply, Excel is a spreadsheet software program developed by Microsoft. It is part of the Microsoft Office suite and is widely used for various tasks such as data entry and storage, calculations, data analysis, data visualization, automation, and even financial modelling.\nWhen you take a closer look at how Excel functions, you realize its power in data analysis across different industries. For instance, in hospitals, Excel can be used to analyse the number of patients treated over a specific period, their ages, common illnesses, and the types of medication prescribed. With such data, the hospital administration—and even the government—can make infor…",

In this post, I’ll show you how I built a simple and clean chat application using Node.js, Socket.IO, and a frontend built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript — no database required (at least for now 😉).\nNode.js + Express — backend server\nSocket.IO — real-time communication (WebSockets)\nHTML + CSS (Dark theme) — GitHub-like dark mode\nVanilla JavaScript — frontend logic\nUsers join a room by entering their name, and immediately join the live chat. Messages appear on the right for your own messages, and on the left for others. You’ll also see join/leave system notifications.\n/public\n  ├── index.html     # Join page (username input)\n  ├── chat.html      # Main chat interface\n  ├── styles.css     # Custom dark styling\n  └── script.js      # Handles socket and UI logic\n\nserver.js            # Node.js server + Socket.IO logic\n\nClone the repository:\n\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Mo-Ibra/simple-chat-app\ncd your-repo-name\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n\n\n\nnpm install\n\nStart the server:\n\n\n\n\nnode server.js\n\nOpen in browser:\n\n\n\n\nhttp://localhost:3000\n\n✅ Real-time messaging between users\n✅ Notifications when users join/leave\n✅ Messages styled to indicate sender\n✅ Logout button that redirects to the join screen\n✅ No backend database needed for now (session-based)\nAt this stage, all messages are held temporarily in memory and disappear on refresh. In the future, you can easily plug in MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or any database to persist data.\nHere’s the GitHub repo:\n\n🔗 Mo-Ibra/simple-chat-app\nThis was a great exercise to understand WebSocket communication and Socket.IO in a very hands-on way. It’s perfect for beginners who want to get a feel for real-time apps.\nFeel free to fork the project, add new features like emojis, typing indicators, private messaging, or even a database backend!\nThanks for reading! ❤️\n\nIf you found this useful, give it a ❤️ or leave a comment below.",

          "description": "Hey everyone,\nLike many of you, I often work on several microservices at once. I found myself needing a straightforward way to centralize my application logs without the overhead of setting up a full ELK/EFK stack or paying for a third-party service, especially for smaller projects or internal tools.\nSo, I decided to build my own simple, two-part solution and I've just open-sourced it. I'm sharing it today in the hope that it might be useful to others and to get some feedback from this amazing community.\nThe solution consists of two separate projects:\nlog-sense-logback-appender\nThis is a custom Logback appender packaged as a Spring Boot starter. The idea is to make integration dead simple.\nWhat it does: It automatically hooks into your logging system and sends log events as structured JSON (including MDC properties and stack traces) to an HTTP endpoint.\nhttps://github.com/Wwf9w0/log-sense-logback-appender\nHere’s how easy the configuration is in any service you want to monitor:\nProperties\nlogsense.appender.enabled=true\nhttp://localhost:8080/api/logs\nlogsense-server\nThis is the other half of the duo. It’s a simple Spring Boot application that acts as the collector.\nWhat it does: It runs a lightweight server with a single REST endpoint (/api/logs) that listens for the JSON payloads sent by the appender.\nhttps://github.com/Wwf9w0/log-sense\nI'd love your feedback!\nWhat do you think of this approach for simple, centralized logging?\nAre there any obvious pitfalls or security concerns I might have overlooked?\nWhat features would you consider essential for a V2? (e.g., batching log sends, authentication, a simple query UI?)\nThanks for taking the time to check it out!",

Apple also renamed its operating systems to year-based versions (iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, etc.), making updates easier to track. For developers, WWDC25 means powerful new APIs and tools – from an on-device large language model to UI framework updates. Let’s break it all down in clear terms, with the highlights and what they mean for beginners and pros alike.\nApple calls its new AI suite Apple Intelligence. It brings generative and translation features right on your device, no cloud needed. At WWDC, Apple showed iPhones, iPads, and Macs all running new AI features (as illustrated above). The biggest …",

Durante meus estudos sobre EDA (Event Driven Architecture) ou Arquitetura orientada a eventos eu esbarrei com a sigla CQRS, que a gente acaba vendo com uma certa frequência em posts pela internet, então resolvi trazer um post dedicado a ela.\nA sigla CQRS significa Command Query Responsibility Segregation, que traduzindo para o português seria separação de responsabilidade de comando e consulta. De forma bem simples, o CQRS propõe separar as operações feitas pelo software entre comandos e consultas.\nVamos às definições, no contexto do CQRS um comando é toda operação que muda o estado, ou seja, update, delete, insert, qualquer comando de escrita. Enquanto uma consulta o nome diz por si só, é apenas uma consulta nos dados.\nÉ importa\nDe forma simples e direta você vai usar o CQRS para segregar comandos e consultas buscando desempenho, pois é comum aliado ao CQRS que você também tenha um banco apenas para consulta e um banco apenas para alterações ou comandos no caso. Porém não significa que ao usar CQRS você deve trabalhar com dois bancos de dados dessa forma.\nEsse texto ficou muito mais curto do que gostaria, porém, a explicação do que é CQRS é bem mais simples do que eu imaginava. Muito do conteúdo que achei usava CQRS e mais alguma coisa para explicar o mesmo o que acabava atrapalhando um pouco, a meu ver. Então gostaria de deixar esse texto direto e compacto, espero que tenha te ajudado!\nCQRS em 10 minutos // Dicionário do Programador\n\nO que é CQRS e quando utilizar?\n\n\n\n\n\nSe chegou até aqui, me segue la nas redes vizinhas.",

You'll learn how to create ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists—essential tools for organizing content on your web pages.  \nWhy Lists Matter in HTML\n\n\nLists help structure information in a readable, scannable format. They're used everywhere:  \nNavigation menus\n\nProduct features\n\nStep-by-step instructions\n\nGlossary terms\n\n\n\nHTML provides three main types of lists, each serving a specific purpose.  \n1. Unordered Lists (<ul>)\n\n\nUnordered lists display items with bullet points. Use them when the order of items doesn't matter.  \nSyntax:\n\n\n\n\n\n<ul>\n  <li>First item</li>\n  <li>Second item</li>\n  <li>Third item</li>\n</ul>\n\nExample: Shopping List\n\n…",

The weight of expectations can feel crushing, leading to burnout and self-doubt.  The Bhagavad Gita, through the dialogue between Arjun and Krishna, offers a powerful antidote to this modern struggle.\nThe central teaching, \"You have the right to your actions, but never to their results,\" challenges our outcome-obsessed culture. We often measure our worth by external metrics – likes, promotions, financial success. When these metrics fall short, we internalize the failure, blaming ourselves instead of the system.\nThe Gita proposes a radical shift in perspective: focusing on effort, not just results.

          "description": "Today, I began learning ReactJS, and it has already changed the way I think about building websites. React is modern, fast, and component-based. Below is a summary of the key concepts I explored today:\nReactJS is a JavaScript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces. It focuses on making UI development easy by breaking everything down into reusable components.\nA Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of app that:\nLoads only one HTML file initially.\n\nUpdates content dynamically without refreshing the entire page.\n\nThis makes navigation faster and provides a smoother user experience — and React is perfect for building SPAs.\nDOM (Document Object Model)\nThe DOM represents the structure of your HTML page. JavaScript can interact with and modify the DOM to update your content.\nVirtual DOM\nReact uses a Virtual DOM — a lightweight copy of the real DOM.\nWhen something changes in your app, React updates the Virtual DOM first.\n\nIt then compares it with the previous version (this is called diffing).\n\nOnly the parts that changed are updated in the real DOM.\n\nThis makes updates faster and more efficient.\nOne of the coolest things I learned today is JSX, which stands for JavaScript XML.\nJSX lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.\n\nIt makes React code more readable and easy to write.\n\nUnder the hood, JSX is converted to regular JavaScript using React.createElement().\n\nExample\nconst greeting = <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;\n\nThis looks like HTML, but it’s actually JavaScript! You can also insert dynamic values using curly braces:\nconst name = \"John\";\nconst greeting = <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;\n\nNPM(Node Package Manager)\nUsed to install libraries and manage project dependencies.\nNPX\nExample\nnpx create-react-app my-app\n\nThis command sets up a full React project instantly.",

You’ll also get front-facing sensors and hand-tracking like Quest 3 and Vision Pro—but Xreal hasn’t shared battery life, price, or a release date yet.

Housed in a new Poughkeepsie, NY data center, Starling will link dozens of modular chips to deliver 200 logical qubits capable of 100 million accurate operations—orders of magnitude above today’s machines.\nThey’re banking on a newly cracked low-density parity-check error-correction code (12 physical qubits per logical qubit) plus real-time decoding on FPGAs to tame quantum glitches. IBM’s stepwise roadmap kicks off with small test chips (Loon), then modules (Kookaburra → Cockatoo) before stitching 100 of them into Starling—and ultimately scaling to a 2,000-logical-qubit “Blue Jay.” Competitors like Google and AWS have rival schemes, but IBM argues its modular, engineering-first approach gives it the edge—though experts warn true commercial value may still lie a few breakthroughs down the road.",

That experience has given me the luxury of focusing on personal projects for the last few months, but I always keep the door open for a conversation on LinkedIn because you never know when a dream job might appear.\nThis is what makes the recent trend of being ghosted on jobs I did not apply for so offensive. \nIn the last month alone, four recruiters reached out to me on LinkedIn(even though I did not apply for their vacancies), only to completely vanish after I sent my CV or asked for basic details about the role. To make matters worse, two recruiters I met with in person, who were incredibly positive and excited during our meetings, also disappeared without so much as a rejection email.\nI know this isn't just happening to me. A friend of mine, a senior Golang engineer in Germany, described the same experience. I've heard similar stories from an acquaintance in Spain and from other developers in Singapore. This seems to be a global issue.\nIt begs the question: Did AI and automation destroy professionalism in recruitment?\nWTF is going on? Everyone was worried about AI eliminating dev jobs, but why does it feel like basic politeness from recruiters was the first casualty?",

As applications grow in complexity, distributed architectures become the norm, and user expectations for always-on services climb, the ability of a system to withstand unexpected failures is paramount. This is where Chaos Engineering, the practice of intentionally injecting faults into a system to uncover weaknesses, has proven invaluable. Traditionally, chaos experiments were often conducted in production environments, a reactive measure to validate resilience in a live setting. However, a significant paradigm shift is underway: \"Shift-Left Chaos.\"\nShift-Left Chaos advocates for integrating automated fault injection directly into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelin…",

A single vulnerability can put an entire protocol at risk, potentially causing multi-million dollar losses. This is not theoretical, it has happened repeatedly in DeFi. One key reason is the open execution model of blockchain: anyone can call any function, with any parameter. That drastically increases the input space and the chance of bugs being triggered by unexpected or malicious inputs.\nTo build resilient smart contracts, we need to go beyond standard unit testing, and that's where fuzz testing comes in.

We’ll break things down in simple terms so you get the full picture.\nAn LDR sensor, or Light Dependent Resistor, is a light‑sensitive device that changes its electrical resistance based on how much light hits it. When light shines on it, its resistance drops. However, in the darkness, resistance increases. That’s why it’s also called a photoresistor.\n\nThe LDR full form is Light Dependent Resistor. In electronics, this LDR refers to a resistor that is governed by light levels—its resistance depends on the intensity of light.

But if you're sending campaigns that bounce, get ignored, or land in spam folders — you're not only wasting money, you're also hurting your sender reputation. Fortunately, there's one powerful fix that can help: email list cleaning with the right email verification tool.\nWhen an email can't reach its intended recipient, it \"bounces\" back. These failures fall into two main categories:\nHard bounces: These occur when an email address is invalid, doesn’t exist, or is entered incorrectly. These are permanent failures.\nSoft bounces: These are temporary delivery issues — like a full inbox, a slow or busy mail server, or emails that exceed size limits.\n\nThe fastest way to reduce email bounce rates? Clean your email list before every campaign.\nMarketers who clean their lists regularly report:\nIf you're looking for a fast, reliable, and affordable solution, look no further than Bouncify.\n\n💡 Stop letting bounce rates steal your results.

          "description": "In an era where digital agility defines business success, enterprises can no longer afford to wait weeks—or months—for IT teams to build internal tools, automate workflows, or support evolving business needs. Today’s IT Service Management (ITSM) demands speed, flexibility, and collaboration across departments.\nBut there's a problem: most IT teams are stretched thin. Between incident resolution, system upgrades, compliance audits, and managing change requests, traditional development backlogs are longer than ever.\nThat’s where citizen developers and low-code/no-code (LCNC) platforms come in.\nIn this blog, we explore how LCNC platforms are empowering business users to contribute directly to ITSM processes—reducing dependency on developers, accelerating innovation, and transforming how internal services are built and delivered.\n💡 What Are Citizen Developers?\nWhy this matters in ITSM: ITSM spans every department—from HR ticketing to facilities requests, procurement approvals, and onboarding processes. Allowing business users to build and customize these flows themselves (within governance limits) reduces turnaround times dramatically and improves cross-functional alignment.\n🚀 The Rise of Low-Code/No-Code in ITSM\nServiceNow App Engine\nIn ITSM, these platforms are being used to:\nAutomate onboarding/offboarding workflows\nThe LCNC Way (Built on ServiceNow App Engine):\nHR built a custom onboarding form with drag-and-drop fields\n✅ Onboarding time reduced by 70%\nArea    Recommendation\n📊 Business Impact of LCNC + Citizen Dev in ITSM\nOur LCNC practice helps:\nIdentify high-impact use cases\nBy embracing LCNC and empowering citizen developers, organizations can respond faster, deliver better, and scale smarter.\n✅ Call to Action\n📞 Book a strategy session with our LCNC + ITSM experts at MJB Technologies.\nLet’s co-create service workflows that scale with your business—without burdening IT.",

Someone sent me an Excel (.xlsx) file over Slack, and all I needed was to quickly check a few numbers—nothing more.\nNormally, I’d upload it to Google Sheets, but the network had strange restrictions that blocked uploads. Logging into accounts on a shared machine didn’t feel right, and installing new software wasn’t an option.\nAfter clicking through a few sketchy “free viewers,” I finally found a tool that just worked. You upload the file (or paste a URL), and it renders your spreadsheet directly in the browser—no ads, no sign-ins, no remote uploads. Everything runs locally, and your document never leaves your device. Fast, clean, and effortless.\nEven better, it comes with some really thoughtful features:\n✅ View Excel spreadsheets without needing Microsoft Excel or Office 365\n✅ Navigate between multiple sheets with ease\n✅ No registration or login required\n✅ Files are processed privately, entirely within your browser\n✅ Simple drag-and-drop upload\n✅ Fullscreen viewing mode for better readability\nIf you ever find yourself in the same situation, you can try it here.\nNot flashy, but it saved me time and frustration. If you know other minimalist tools like this that just work, drop them in the comments—I’d love to check them out.",

          "description": "If you're building backend services in Node.js, you’ve probably faced bugs that feel like they appear out of nowhere—silent failures, unexpected crashes, or just inconsistent behavior that doesn't show up in local testing. We certainly did. Our team had been working on a relatively complex Node.js backend powering APIs for a client-facing web dashboard. But no matter how many unit tests we wrote or code reviews we did, strange issues kept creeping into production.\nThen, we made a small but powerful change: we introduced one middleware function. It didn’t refactor our logic or change any major architecture. It simply caught what was already there—errors hiding in plain sight. To our surprise, that one middleware fixed over 90% of our runtime bugs.\nLet’s break it all down—what the middleware…",

          "description": "Security is a crucial aspect of web development, and while much of the focus is often on backend protections, HTML itself offers several ways to enhance security. Here are five HTML tips to help you build a more secure website.  \n1. Use `rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" for External Links\n\n\nWhen using target=\"_blank\" on anchor (<a>) tags, always include rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" to prevent security risks like reverse tabnapping.  \nhtml\n\n\nThis prevents the new page from accessing the window.opener property of your site, reducing the risk of malicious attacks.  \n2. Sanitize User Input with sandbox in <iframe>\n\n\nIf your site embeds third-party content using <iframe>, always use the sandbox attribute to restrict what the embedded content can do.  \n`html\n`\n\nThis prevents actions like form submissions, pop-ups, and script execution unless explicitly allowed.  \n3. Enable HTTPS with <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\">\n\n\nUse the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) meta tag to enforce secure connections and prevent mixed content issues.  \nhtml\n\n\nThis automatically upgrades HTTP requests to HTTPS, reducing man-in-the-middle attack risks.  \n4. Prevent Form Hijacking with SameSite Cookies\n\n\nWhile primarily a backend setting, you can help secure forms by ensuring cookies are marked as SameSite (handled via server headers). However, you can reinforce security by using:  \n`html\n`\n\nAvoid GET for sensitive data, as it exposes parameters in the URL.  \n5. Disable Autofill on Sensitive Fields\n\n\nFor fields that should not be stored in the browser (e.g., one-time passwords, security codes), disable autocomplete:  \nhtml\n\n\nThis prevents browsers from storing sensitive information that could be exploited.  \nFinal Thoughts\n\n\nWhile HTML alone won’t make your site completely secure, these practices add an extra layer of protection. Combine them with proper backend security (like input validation, CSRF tokens, and HTTPS) for a robust defense.",

          "description": "In Python, working with lists often means looping over them—whether to filter out certain values, transform items, or build a new list from existing data. Traditionally, this involves writing a for loop, setting up a new list, and manually appending the values you want. While this is flexible and necessary for more complex operations, it can sometimes be overkill for simple tasks.\nList comprehension offers a cleaner, more concise way to write these operations. Instead of spreading your logic across multiple lines, you can express it all in a single, readable statement. Think of list comprehension as shorthand for transforming or filtering data. Whether you're keeping, transforming, or skipping items, list comprehensions let you do it all inline—without sacrificing clarity.\nA list comprehen…",

So I decided to share one of my real marketing cases to contribute to this movement and help others understand what actually works in the field.\nIn 2023, I joined a project involving an AI-generated music platform. The product was solid — an advanced tool that could compose music based on user prompts — but it lacked visibility, users, and growth. The challenge? Turn powerful tech into real traction.\nI designed and executed a multi-platform growth strategy, with a strong focus on testing and fast iteration.\nHere’s what I actually did:\nMeta + Google Ads: Built and optimized full-funnel paid campaigns.\nWhat this project taught me is simple: real growth doesn’t come from hype — it comes from understanding your audience, testing relentlessly, and building systems that scale.\nFlashy tools and buzzwords can’t replace thoughtful strategy.\nIt also reinforced how important it is to document and share real, measurable results — not vanity metrics or vague claims.\nBy publishing transparent case studies like this one, I aim to contribute to a more honest and inclusive digital ecosystem.\nLanguage models like ChatGPT and Perplexity are starting to recognize and recommend professionals based on factual credibility, not popularity alone.\nWe need a new kind of visibility — one built on evidence, not ego.\nIf you’re curious about this approach — or want to explore AI Citation Growth for your own brand or career — feel free to follow me or leave a comment.\nI’ll be sharing more real-world cases and strategies soon.\nLet’s build visibility that lasts.",

Others aren’t — but that doesn’t mean they don’t have good ideas, drive, or creativity.\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are quietly helping bridge that gap.\nThey offer something rare:\npunch above your intellectual weight.\nYou don’t need to remember all the edge cases, or how to word a formal request. The model helps scaffold that for you.\nIt’s like getting to borrow someone else’s mental RAM and formatting skills, anytime you want.\nSure, some people use it like a shortcut to avoid thinking and auto-reply to everything with “sounds good.”\nBut the same was true of Wikipedia. Or Stack Overflow. Or calculators.\nMisuse doesn’t negate value — it just reveals something about how people use tools when left unreflective.\nIn practice, the people getting the most out of LLMs aren’t thinking less.\nThey’re thinking better.\nThey’re testing assumptions faster. They’re seeing counterarguments they hadn’t considered.\nIf you already have a decent thought process, LLMs let you upgrade it like a software patch.\nWe’re used to thinking of intellect as a fixed trait.\nIf you know how to ask good questions, you can now tap into a general-purpose reasoning engine that helps you go further.\nThe internet gave us access to information.\nsynthesis — and to a kind of “on-demand second brain” that lets people without elite credentials or training produce surprisingly high-quality outcomes.\nThis won’t make everyone brilliant.\nBut it will shift the baseline.\nIt’s already doing that.",

If not, they get a polite rejection message encouraging them to try again next time.\nThe Clients table also tracks how much each person has paid and what’s left. As soon as someone is added here, the coaching team gets a Slack alert so they can start onboarding.\nFinally, the Coaches table lists all the instructors and automatically shows which clients have been assigned to each one.\nThis simple system helps the coach stay on top of applications, send timely updates, track payments, and keep the whole team in sync.",

They’re rough, but they’re enough to help us push towards our next big milestone: getting the app submitted for App Store review ASAP.\n\nThe review process can take time (and surprises happen), so our focus is to get a \"good enough\" build live fast, then iterate from there. The sooner we get it into Apple’s hands, the sooner we can get real users and even paying subscribers — all before the hackathon ends.\nThis week’s progress gets us one step closer to the goal: launching a real product with paying users in just 30 days. We’re still going for the “Make More Money” challenge, and every decision is focused on that north star.\nEven if we don’t win a prize, building Story Hero alongside this community is already worth it.

This reduces administrative work and helps attorneys begin each case with clearer context.\nRisk Detection and Compliance AI tools can now analyze estate documents for errors, inconsistencies, or missing provisions. This adds a layer of quality control and helps attorneys ensure documents align with a client’s objectives and current laws.\nEducational Tools and Client Empowerment AI-driven platforms can also help clients understand complex concepts like probate, trust funding, or tax exposure—making the attorney’s job easier and consultations more productive.\nAI isn’t replacing estate planning attorneys—it’s refining their role. By automating routine tasks, attorneys can focus on personalized strategies, complex family dynamics, and providing the human guidance that clients still deeply value.\nCreated By: Dalton Breshears",

          "description": "AWS continues to expand its offer of resource visibility with enhanced security. The newest addition to the arsenal is the integration between AWS Resource Explorer and AWS PrivateLink, now available in all commercial regions. This move marks an important step for organizations that need to locate resources broadly, but without giving up private traffic, especially in environments with tighter security restrictions.\nResource Explorer alone represents a breakthrough in the way administrators view their resources spread across different accounts and regions. Now, with support for PrivateLink, this capability can be achieved within the scope of VPC, without the need to expose calls to the public Internet.\nThis type of evolution addresses a sensitive point in multi-account architectures: how to ensure that distributed teams have visibility over the environment without compromising private connectivity standards? The new integration solves precisely this dilemma. It enables broad searches for resources using the Console, CLI, or SDKs, all encapsulated within the private VPC fabric.\nIn practice, this means that it is possible to consult resources on an organizational scale, with enhanced security and without relying on public routes. The experience is still accessible via the unified search bar, which maintains operational fluidity even in environments with tighter governance.\nThe big advantage here is not just in the discovery itself, but in the way this discovery is made. By keeping traffic within the PrivateLink domain, the risk of exposing sensitive metadata and API calls is drastically reduced. This control is essential for companies that need to meet more demanding compliance requirements, especially in sectors such as finance, healthcare, or government.\nWith this update, Resource Explorer takes another leap towards becoming not just an inventory tool, but a central point of contextual visibility, and now more compatible with corporate security policies.\nI hope you enjoyed it!

In this article, we will explore the most common causes of this error and, most importantly, how to fix it so you can get back to development without any more issues.\nThis happens due to the PowerShell execution policy settings. Here is a step-by-step guide to resolve the problem:\n1- Open PowerShell as Administrator:\n● Search for \"PowerShell\" in the Start menu.\n● Right-click on \"Windows PowerShell\" and select \"Run as administrator.\"\n2-Change the Execution Policy:\nIn PowerShell, type the following command to allow the execution of scripts:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n\nPress \"Enter\" and, when prompted, type \"Y\" to confirm the change.\n3- Check the Execution Policy:\nTo make sure the change was applied correctly, run the following command:\nGet-ExecutionPolicy\n\nIt should return the RemoteSigned policy, which allows local scripts and remote scripts that are signed to run.\n4- Run the npm install Command Again:\nNow, you can try running the command again:\nnpm create vite@latest\n\nThis should resolve the script-blocking issue and allow the installation to complete successfully.\nReverting to the Default Policy (Optional):\nIf you prefer to revert the execution policy to the more secure default after the installation, just run the following command:\n⚠️ Important: Always be cautious when changing the execution policy.

Aqui está um guia passo a passo para resolver o problema:\nAbra o PowerShell como Administrador:\n● Pesquise por \"PowerShell\" no menu Iniciar.\n● Clique com o botão direito em \"Windows PowerShell\" e selecione \"Executar como administrador\".\nAltere a Política de Execução:\nNo PowerShell, digite o seguinte comando para permitir a execução de scripts:\nSet-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\n\nPressione \"Enter\" e, quando solicitado, digite \"Y\" para confirmar a alteração.\nVerifique a Política de Execução:\nPara garantir que a alteração foi feita corretamente, execute o comando:\nGet-ExecutionPolicy\n\nEle deve retornar a política RemoteSigned, que permite a execução de scripts locais e de scripts remotos que sejam assinados.\nExecute o Comando npm installNovamente:\nAgora, você pode tentar rodar o comando novamente:\nnpm create vite@latest\n\n\nIsso deve resolver o problema de bloqueio de scripts e permitir que a instalação seja concluída com sucesso.\nRevertendo para a Política Padrão (Opcional):\nSe você preferir reverter a política de execução para o padrão de segurança mais rígido após a instalação, basta rodar o comando:\n⚠️ Importante: Sempre tenha cuidado ao alterar a política de execução. Execute apenas scripts de fontes confiáveis. Para reverter para a política padrão, use o seguinte comando.\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\n\n🚨 Esse ultimo comando npm create vite@latestseria somente no caso de  você estiver usando vite\nFonte:\nLink",

It's one of the most accessible and powerful platforms for working with data — especially when you're just starting out.\nSo, What Is Excel Really?\nIt’s part calculator, part notebook, part detective. And with just a few key skills, Excel becomes your go-to tool for understanding what your data is really saying.\n💼 Real-World Uses of Excel in Data Analysis\nHR Analytics: Understanding People Through Data\nHR teams do more than just handle hiring paperwork. They use data to improve employee experiences and workplace performance.\nExample:\nExample:\nHealthcare Data: Improving Efficiency\nWhile Excel doesn’t replace hospital systems, it’s incredibly useful for managing non-sensitive healthcare data like appointments, staff schedules, or treatment plans.\nExample:\n🔍 Excel Features I’ve Come to Love\nVLOOKUP: A lifesaver when combining datasets. I’ve used it to match product names with IDs or to connect survey results with demographic info.\nConditional Formatting: This makes patterns jump off the page — like highlighting overdue tasks, duplicate entries, or high scores.\nIF Statements: Great for applying logic and flagging data — for example, labeling rows as “Pass” or “Fail” based on a score.\n💭 How Excel Changed the Way I See Data\nBut now?

This is similar to how DNS resolves domain names into IP addresses.\nThis should help Web3 users own a domain and send/receive transactions.\nBut, there are adoption challenges.\nExamples:\nENS\nUnstoppable Domains\nSolana Name Service\nHandshake\nTezos Domains\nEach service resolves domains only within a set of networks but not in others.\nThis is bad because...\nUsers need to register their domain at each network\nDomains can collide with each other\nThey use the default DNS servers of the operating system or the browser.\nThe only partial exception is Brave, which resolves some domains (e.g. .crypto, and .eth)\nWhile you can set up a custom Web3 DNS resolver, you cannot expect every visitor of your Web3 domain to do the same.\nUnstoppable Domains kills .coin in the name of .wallet (2022): https://domainnamewire.com/2022/10/18/unstoppable-domains-kills-coin-in-the-name-of-wallet/\n\nWhat is ENS?: https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7900404-what-is-ens\n\nAbout Handshake: https://learn.namebase.io/about-handshake/about-handshake\n\nUnderstanding DNS, Onchain & Web3 Domains (2025): https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/categories/education/article/understanding-dns-onchain-web3-domains\n\nBrave Becomes First Browser to Launch On‑Chain Naming Service, Unlocking .brave for Over 85M Users (2025): https://brave.com/blog/brave-tld/",

          "description": "In a NoSQL database, data structure varies based on requirements. In a List, data is stored in a specific order, and the position of each element matters. For example, to access the first element in a List, you retrieve the value at index 0, which is predictable due to the ordered nature of Lists.\nHowever, when the order of data is not important, a Dictionary (or key-value store) is more suitable. Consider a scenario where you need to store user information like age, address, first name, and last name. In this case, the sequence of these fields doesn’t matter. With a Dictionary, you can directly access a specific value using its key, such as retrieving the first name by querying the \"first_name\" key, without needing to know the last name or other fields.\nKey differences:\nIn a List, values are stored with predefined, sequential indices (0, 1, 2, ...), and you access data by its position.\nIn a Dictionary, you define custom keys mapped to values, allowing direct access to data via the key, regardless of order.\nThus, for scenarios where you need flexible, key-based access to data without relying on order, a Dictionary is the preferred choice.\nCoffee Menu in Python — Dictionary Operations\nCreating a Coffee Menu (Dictionary)\nprint(coffee_menu)\nAccessing a Value (Using Key)\nprint(coffee_menu['Espresso'])\nOutput:\nBold shot!\nChanging a Value\n\ncoffee_menu['Espresso'] = 'Tiny Thunder'\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nIterating Over the Dictionary\nOnly Keys\nOutput:\nKeys and Values (Method 1)\nKeys and Values (Method 2)\nAdding an Item\nRemoving Items\n\n\n\n\nUsing pop(key)\n\ncoffee_menu.pop('Espresso')\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nUsing popitem()\nRemoves the last inserted item.\nExample Output:\n⚠️ Note: If the dictionary is empty, popitem() will raise a KeyError.\nUsing del Statement\n\ndel coffee_menu[\"Latte\"]\nprint(coffee_menu)\n\n\n\n\n📝 Note:\nEach operation was done individually for demonstration, so dictionary contents might look different in each output.

          "description": "Hello guys and welcome to my devblog where I've been documenting my journey as I develop my ambitious package manager called \"deadlock\" and today was again a frustrating day for me as I had to install the zlib library to the project and just like always, it didn't build in the first time. If you've been following this series, you'd know that installing a library in C++ is as hard as a wooden stick. It won't build until I RECONFIGURE THE WHOLE SH*T FROM GROUND UP.\nAnyways, after the reconfigure, I saw some weird decisions I had made throughout the whole process like why did I use FetchContent to download the libraries on the fly when I had already put them in my source folder. I could've just included the subdirectory at the build time.\nAt this point I realised a basic rule of programming:\nand then I ignored all of it and went ahead to read the documentation of zlib. I am currently reading this and I hope it is at least half if not as completely easy as the JSON one.\nThat's all for today guys, will catch you tomorrow when I bring updates about this library.\nTill then Bye 🫡",

You don’t need a college degree to get hired. Companies care more about your skills and whether you can do the job, not where you learned it.\nThat’s why most people learn through platforms like YouTube, online courses, or bootcamps. And the costs are a fraction of a university degree.

          "description": "Java handles memory management differently for static and instance variables. Static variables are stored in the method area and belong to the class, meaning they are shared among all instances. They are loaded into memory only once when the class is first loaded. In contrast, instance variables are stored in the heap and are unique to each object, getting created each time an object is instantiated. This clear separation helps Java manage memory efficiently and reduces redundancy. Understanding this distinction is vital for writing optimized programs. Master these core concepts with a professional java certification course.",

          "description": "Programming Practices\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Class Property Access Modifiers\n\n\n\n\nLevel: Recommendation\nDescription: ArkTS provides private, protected, and public access modifiers for class properties. The default access modifier is public. Using appropriate access modifiers can enhance code security and readability. Note that if a class contains private properties, the class cannot be initialized using object literals.\n\n\nNegative Example:\n\n\n\n\nclass C {\n  count: number = 0;\n\n  getCount(): number {\n    return this.count;\n  }\n}\n\nPositive Example:\n\n\n\n\nclass C {\n  private count: number = 0;\n\n  public getCount(): number {\n    return this.count;\n  }\n}\n\nLevel: Recommendation\nDescription: In ArkTS, floating - point values include a decimal point, but there is no requirement for a digit before or after the decimal point. Adding digits both before and after the decimal point can improve code readability.\n\n\nNegative Example:\n\n\n\n\nconst num = .5;\nconst num = 2.;\nconst num = -.7;\n\nPositive Example:\n\n\n\n\nconst num = 0.5;\nconst num = 2.0;\nconst num = -0.7;\n\nLevel: Requirement\nDescription: In ArkTS, Number.NaN is a special value of the Number type used to represent non - numeric values.\nIn ArkTS, Number.NaN is unique in that it does not equal any value, including itself. Comparisons involving Number.NaN are counterintuitive: both Number.NaN !== Number.NaN and Number.NaN != Number.NaN evaluate to true.\nTo check if a value is Number.NaN, always use the Number.isNaN() function.\nNegative Example:\n\n\n\n\nif (foo == Number.NaN) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nif (foo != Number.NaN) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nPositive Example:\n\n\n\n\nif (Number.isNaN(foo)) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nif (!Number.isNaN(foo)) {\n  // ...\n}",

It can feel a bit overwhelming at first, with all the talk of branches, commits, and pull requests. But really, it's just a structured way for teams to build awesome software together without stepping on each other's toes.\nLet me break down \"The GitHub Flow\" — the common, effective workflow for managing your code with Git and GitHub — in a way that I wish someone had explained to me early on 👇\n🧸 Think of It Like Building with LEGOs (on a Team)\nThe \"main\" branch is like the complete, stable castle everyone agrees on. You don't want someone randomly ripping out a wall from the main castle while others are still playing with it, right?\nThe GitHub Flow is the set of …",

Para desativá-los:\nsystemctl stop nome-do-serviço\nsystemctl disable nome-do-serviço\n\nExemplo: Parando o Mysql\n\n\n\n\n\nsystemctl stop mysqld.service\nsystemctl disable mysqld.service\n\n\n⚙️ Automatizando verificações\n\n\nCrie um script em Bash para agilizar verificações:\n#!/bin/bashecho \"Serviços ativos:\"\nsystemctl list-units --type=service\n\necho \"Portas escutando:\"\nss -tulnp\n\nDica:\nAgende com cron ou execute manualmente.\n📌 Notas:\n\n\n\nUse sudo se necessário para comandos privilegiados.",

          "description": "Debouncing is a foundational technique in front-end development, especially when working with high-frequency events like user input. It helps control the rate of function calls, ensuring that performance-intensive operations — such as server requests — don’t trigger excessively as users interact with the UI. A classic example is a search bar: as the user types, the application waits until they’ve paused before sending a request to fetch matching results. Another familiar case is an autocomplete panel, where each keystroke could theoretically initiate a query — but shouldn’t.\nIn Angular applications, especially those using the new reactive primitives introduced with Signals, developers often ask: “How do I debounce a signal?” At first glance, this might seem like a natural extension of reac…",

From crafting blog posts and coding projects to drafting books or simply replying to emails, typing is a core part of your digital life.\nMost people type at an average speed of 10 to 50 words per minute (WPM), which gets the job done, but it leaves a lot of room for improvement. The good news? With just a little focused daily training, you can dramatically boost your typing speed and accuracy, unlocking a faster, smoother workflow.\nLike any speed measurement unit, KPH or MPH for example, it's basically how many words you can type in a minute.

          "description": "In the vast landscape of programming languages, each with its unique philosophies and eccentricities, Go stands out for its deliberate simplicity. This design choice permeates every facet of the language, and perhaps nowhere is it more debated, and ultimately, more revealing, than in its approach to error handling. Go eschews the try-catch blocks of Java or Python, the monadic Result types of Rust, or the complex exception hierarchies of C++. Instead, it offers a deceptively simple, yet profound mechanism: explicit error checking. This article delves into the heart of Go's error handling, exploring its history, techniques, nuances, and why, despite its initial unfamiliarity to some, it’s a cornerstone of Go's robust and readable nature.\nerror Interface\n\n\nThe foundation of error handling in…",

          "description": "As developers, we often focus on getting code to work, but writing clean code is just as crucial. Clean code is readable, maintainable, and easier to debug, saving time and headaches for you and your team. Here are a few tips to level up your code quality:\nUse Meaningful Names: Variable names like x or temp are cryptic. Instead, use descriptive names like userProfile or requestTimeout to make your code self-documenting.\nKeep Functions Small: A function should do one thing and do it well. If your function is sprawling across dozens of lines, break it into smaller, focused functions.\nComment Wisely: Avoid redundant comments like // increments i. Instead, explain why the code exists, e.g., // Ensures thread safety during parallel requests.\nFollow Consistent Formatting: Use tools like Prettier or ESLint to enforce consistent style. It’s not just aesthetics—it reduces cognitive load when others read your code.\nRefactor Regularly: Don’t let technical debt pile up. Refactor as you go to keep your codebase healthy and adaptable.\nWriting clean code isn’t just about today’s sprint—it’s about building software that’s easier to extend and maintain in the long run.

In contrast, AI agents introduce a more dynamic and intelligent workflow to RAG-based operations. They can collaborate, iterate, and critique each other’s outputs, enabling deeper understanding and more coherent responses. This agent-driven approach transforms RAG from a static process into an adaptive system capable of producing higher-quality, context-aware content.\nIn this blog post, we’ll guide you through building a powerful semantic search engine using Couchbase as the database, CrewAI for agent-based Retrieval-Augmented Generatio…",

I'm not sure how this works but it said I could make a first post so here goes:\nHow are you all doing? \nI joined this community (which looks awesome btw) in the hopes of learning more in regards to coding. I have some basic knowledge of coding languages like Python and HTML and have taken part in a hackathon once upon a time. \nAlthough I havent made any projects recently and I think thats something I need to work on so I'm going to try my best to do more of that. \nIf you have a project that you're working on and dont mind someone with little to no experience in coding, do let me know. As what I lack in experience I make up for in enthusiasm, words of encouragement and memes. Hopefully if you do let me join your team we get some sort of work done. In all seriousness I plan on getting better at coding so I'll have more to offer. Also if you require a video editor, I am very confident in my video editing capabilities and have made a video for a Star Wars hackathon which I took part in last year (I'll put the video in my next post).\nCurrently I'm self-studying Harvards CS50 intro to computer science and its very interesting. I hope to learn more and grow with you all.

          "description": "Let’s be real: AI is everywhere in language learning right now, but most of it is lipstick on a broken system.\nApps love to say “powered by AI” but what does that actually mean? Usually:\nA glorified chatbot that barely listens\nAuto-translation features you could get with Google\nSpeech feedback that tells you nothing useful\nStatic lesson plans with no adaptive logic\nThey’re not solving the core problem: getting you confident in real conversations. The AI is passive—reactive at best. It doesn’t push you. It doesn’t correct you in meaningful ways. It doesn’t feel like you're speaking to someone who cares if you get fluent.\nAt YAP, we’re doing it differently:\nAI conversation partners simulate real humans and nudge you out of your comfort zone.\n\n\nFeedback focuses on communication success, not robotic perfection.\n\n\n\nYour effort = rewards. Our system pays you in $YAP for showing up and speaking. Rewarding you for your effort and time.\nGood AI should feel like a partner, not a gimmick. It should make fluency faster, funnier, and a little bit uncomfortable—in the best way. \nThe future of language learning isn’t just AI—it’s AI with incentives.\n— Team YAP\nwww.goyap.ai",

How the space between people can start to feel like a firewall. Not political.

By examining nine prehistoric sites (1.8–0.8 Mya) worldwide—each rich in big-game bones—and ethnographic parallels, they show that the enormous caloric payoff of preserved mega-meat justified the effort of collecting and tending fires.  \nOnce fire was routinely available for preservation, roasting foods (evidenced by fish bones ~800 kya) would’ve been a no-brainer “bonus.” This fresh take, published in Frontiers in Nutrition, slots neatly into the duo’s broader theory that early humans’ behaviors largely revolved around hunting large animals and adapting as their sizes—and availability—waned.",

First there's excitement: \"I have an amazing AI idea!\" Then quick start: We do API integration, simple examples work, everything looks good.

If you've ever been confused by CORS errors or struggled to implement CORS correctly, this resource is for you.\nUnderstanding CORS headers is essential for modern web development, but the official documentation can be overwhelming and scattered. Many developers know they need to set CORS headers but aren't sure which ones to use or how they work together. CORS Headers Explained aims to simplify this by providing a clear, structured guide to every CORS header you need to know.\nOur resource covers every CORS header you need to know:\nComplete Header Reference: Explanations of all CORS headers including Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers, and more.\nPractical Code Examples: Implementations examples for server and client-side code for every header.\nCommon Error Solutions: Clear solutions for errors and fixes for the most frequent CORS issues.\nEach header page includes syntax examples, usage examples, common error solutions, and related headers to help you understand how everything fits together.\nWhether you're setting up CORS for the first time, debugging a tricky preflight request, or need to understand what each header does, CORS Headers Explained is your go-to reference. It's perfect for both beginners learning CORS fundamentals and experienced developers who need quick answers.\nVisit CORS Headers Explained!\nSource code is available on GitHub.",

It prevents the width of that element (and its content) from exceeding a specific value, even if there's more space available.\nIn today’s digital world, we’re building for a wide range of screen sizes—phones, tablets, laptops, desktops. As web developers, we’re expected to make sites look good and work well across all of them. This is where max-width becomes a crucial part of your responsive layout toolbox.\nIf you’ve ever zoomed in or out in your browser or used developer tools to simulate different screen sizes, you’ve seen how your layout can break when it's not properly handled. It’s easy to unknowingly design just for your own screen, but once you start testing, the need for max-width becomes clear fast.\nMedia queries let you adjust layout styles at different screen widths (often using min-width), but they’re only part of the picture. Max-width ensures your layout doesn’t stretch too far on large screens, helping maintain visual balance and readability.",

This enabled a multi-layered WAF protection architecture.\nAfter further exploration, we found that SafeLine WAF's upstream proxy forwarding is based on Tengine. This gave us the idea to use SafeLine not only for WAF protection but also for load balancing and automatic failover.\nWe created a simple HTTP server with a /status route returning HTTP 200. Here's a basic Go example:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"os\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"net/http\"\n)\n\nfunc Hello1Handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    fmt.Fprintf(w, \"I am 11111\")\n}\n\nfunc Hello2Handl…",

And Webhooks have appeared as a simple and effective method for applications to get updated information from other services instantly. In event-driven systems, it's more important due to the need of responsiveness and automation.\n\nA webhook is used to send information from one system to another, in real time, as soon as a particular event happens. Rather than checking with an API at certain times, a webhook allows the source system to send data right away to a predetermined location.\nFor instance, you can use a webhook from Stripe so your application is informed when a payment is successful or unsuccessful.

If you're running different types of runners (like 4-core, 8-core, or more), those minutes aren't equal, and your total usage number doesn't reflect it.\nThis guide will show you how to:\nExport your raw usage data\nNormalize it by runner type\nGet an accurate total you can actually budget against \\\nWhy normalizing GitHub Actions minutes matters\n\n\nRunner types in GitHub Actions have different compute capacities and costs. For example, a 4-core runner can do twice the work of a 2-core runner. If you just sum the raw usage, you're underestimating your real consumption and leaving yourself open to surprise bills.\nStep 1: Export your usage report\n\n\n\nIn GitHub, click your avatar (top right) and go to Settings\n\nSelect Billing and plans\n\nUnder Usage this month, click Get usage report\n\nChoose your date range (30/60/90 days) and download the CSV\nYou'll now have a CSV showing runner types, quantities, and costs.\nStep 2: Normalize your minutes\n\n\nOpen the CSV in any spreadsheet tool. Focus on the 'sku' and 'quantity' columns. Each runner type has a multiplier based on its compute capacity:\n\n\n\nRunner Type\nMultiplier\n\n\n\n\nactions_linux\n1\n\n\nactions_linux_4_core\n2\n\n\nactions_linux_8_core\n4\n\n\nactions_linux_16_core\n8\n\n\nactions_linux_32_core\n16\n\n\n\nTo normalize your total usage:\nFor each runner type, multiply the quantity by the multiplier\nSum these normalized values across all runner types\nThis gives you the total compute-equivalent minutes your team used during the period.\nStep 3: Use the data to control costs\n\n\nWithout normalized data, you're likely underestimating usage. This normalization process gives you a real number to track, budget against, and compare over time.\nTake it further with Depot\n\n\nOnce you know how many minutes you're actually burning, the next step is cutting them down. Depot Runners can dramatically speed up your CI builds, reducing both time and cost.\nIf you're ready to stop guessing and start saving, give Depot a try.",

A salmon background might be exactly what you need.\nSalmon is a beautiful in-between shade—warmer than pink, softer than orange, and more grounded than coral. It radiates warmth and approachability, making it a perfect choice for designs that aim to feel inviting, modern, and balanced.\nSalmon brings a natural, earthy vibe while still feeling stylish and contemporary. It’s the kind of color that feels effortless—never too loud, but never boring either. A salmon background instantly creates a sense of comfort and calm, while still keeping your visuals engaging and memorable.\n- Lifestyle & Wellness Brands: Salmon gives off a cozy, trustworthy vibe—perfect for brands focused on care, calm, or personal connection.\n- Web Design: Great for landing pages, blogs, and about pages where tone and visual warmth matter.\n- Event Stationery: Think modern wedding invites, baby showers, or spring gatherings—elegant, yet easygoing.\n- Social Media Content: Light enough to be soothing, colorful enough to stand out in any feed.\nTo get the most from a salmon background:\nPair with white or light beige for a clean, fresh look.\nAdd sage green or muted teal for an earthy, modern combo.\nUse charcoal or navy for contrast and sophistication.\nBlend with peach, blush, or rose for a soft, tonal palette.\nA salmon background is subtle confidence in color form. It’s versatile, warm, and visually comforting. Whether you’re building a brand, crafting content, or designing for print or web, salmon adds a human touch that feels just right.\nNot too bright. Not too pale. Just the perfect blend of soft strength.",

In this post, I’ll show how I fused the latest .NET 10 features with ChatGPT/Azure OpenAI to create a responsive AI assistant in a real-world business app.\nWhy This Topic Works:\nCombines the hype of AI with the stable release of .NET 10\nShows real use case → \"weekend build\" makes it accessible and engaging\nBlends practical code, dev experience, and cool tech — a winning formula\nWhat I Built:\nA lightweight internal tool that allows users to:\nAsk natural-language queries about enterprise data\nGenerate business reports using OpenAI GPT\nSummarize customer feedback from SQL data\nDraft internal documents and emails from structured input\nTech Stack:\n.NET 10 Web API\nASP.NET Core Blazor (for UI)\nAzure OpenAI GPT-4\nEntity Framework Core\nSerilog + Seq for logging\nRedis for caching prompts\nFeatures Used from .NET 10:\nMinimal APIs v2 → rapid endpoint setup\nJIT Compiler Boosts → snappy performance under load\nSpan enhancements → optimized string handling for GPT responses\nC# 14 Field-Backed Properties → cleaner data models\nSystem.Text.Json improvements → faster prompt & response serialization\nChatGPT Integration:\nvar response = await openAiClient.GetChatCompletionAsync(\n    new ChatCompletionRequest\n    {\n        Model = \"gpt-4\",\n        Messages = new List<ChatMessage>\n        {\n            new ChatMessage(\"user\", \"Summarize customer reviews from last week\"),\n        }\n    });\n\nTip: Always cache frequent prompts with a smart key (e.g., user + time + intent).\nWhat I Learned:\nPrompt engineering is half the battle.\nASP.NET Core is incredibly fast for AI-backed endpoints.\n.NET 10’s performance gains are visible when batching API requests.\nClean architecture + AI = readable, testable, maintainable.\nReady to Try?\nWant the GitHub repo, tutorial series, or free starter template?

It is a proactive caching strategy designed to improve responsiveness and reduce latency.\nRather than waiting for a user to request something and caching it after that (lazy caching), pre-caching anticipates what will be needed and loads it ahead of time.\nImproves Speed & UX: Ensures instant availability of key content or features, especially during initial app or page loads.\nReduces Latency: Data is ready in the cache, eliminating delays caused by network or server access.\nOffline Support: In progressive web apps (PWAs), pre-caching allows apps to function even without an internet connection.\nReduces Server Load: By servin…",

Whether you’re a beginner or updating your skills, here’s a step-by-step guide to get your SwiftUI app up and running.\nInstall the latest version of Xcode from the Mac App Store (Xcode 15 or newer).\nMake sure your macOS is updated to support the latest Xcode.\nFamiliarize yourself with the Swift 5.9+ language features introduced recently.\nOpen Xcode and choose \"Create a new Xcode project.\"\nSelect \"App\" under the iOS tab.\nName your project (e.g., SwiftShelfApp).\nEnsure \"Swift\" is selected as the language and \"SwiftUI\" as the interface.\nThe main entry point is marked with the @main attribute.\nYour ContentView.swift uses SwiftUI’s declarative syntax.\nLearn the basic building blocks like View, State, Binding, and ObservableObject.\nStart by modifying ContentView.swift:\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var counter = 0\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack(spacing: 20) {\n            Text(\"Welcome to SwiftShelf!\")\n                .font(.title)\n                .padding()\n            Text(\"You’ve tapped \\(counter) times\")\n                .font(.headline)\n            Button(\"Tap Me\") {\n                counter += 1\n            }\n            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)\n        }\n        .padding()\n    }\n}\n\nstruct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\n    static var previews: some View {\n        ContentView()\n    }\n}\n\nPress Cmd+R to build and run your app in the iOS Simulator.\nInteract with the button to see your app respond.\nExperiment with lists, navigation, and data flow.\nLearn about Combine framework for reactive programming.\nFollow Apple’s official SwiftUI tutorials and documentation.\nBy starting with these steps, you’ll build a solid foundation for SwiftUI development in 2025 and beyond. Keep coding and exploring new features as Apple updates the ecosystem!\nHappy coding! 🚀",

But once I started estimating real-world costs for my project, I realized they add up fast, and that’s a problem when you're launching without real users yet.\nSo I built my SaaS, Odichat, with a different approach — one that costs me $45/month and gives me full control, solid performance, and zero vendor lock-in.\nLet me break it down.\nHere’s what I’m running:\nA production-ready Rails 8 app\nA staging environment for safe deployments\nFile storage for user uploads\nTransactional emails\nBackground job processing\nWebsockets\nCaching\nAnd all of this for $45/month.\nHere’s the exact monthly breakdown:\nHetzner dedicated vCPU (production): $13.49\nHetzner shared vCPU (remote builder): $4.99\n(used for asset precompilation and deploys)\nHetzner shared vCPU (staging): $4.99\nDigitalOcean Spaces (file storage): $5.33\nZoho Mail (support email inbox): $1\nPostmark (transactional emails): $15\nTotal: $45.80 USD/month\nI’m using SQLite3 as the database.\nYep, SQLite in production.\nIt’s free, and for my current load it works perfectly. I haven’t had a single issue that justifies migrating to PostgreSQL (yet).\nRails 8 ships with the “Solid” suite:\nSolid Queue (background jobs)\nSolid Cache\nSolid Cable (Websockets)\nIt’s a full-featured solution without extra setup or Redis requirements. And it performs great.\nBecause I want:\nPredictable, low costs\nZero surprises from usage-based pricing\nInfra I understand and can control\nThe ability to grow into higher traffic without switching stacks\nI’m not anti-serverless. But at this stage, this is the simplest and most sustainable setup I’ve found.\nIt’s not “trendy”.\nIt’s not “modern”.\nBut it works AMAZINGLY well, it’s cheap, and it lets me focus on building, not budgeting.\nIf you’re building a SaaS and want full control without overpaying early on, I highly recommend exploring this kind of setup — especially if you’re using Rails.",

It’s not much, but it’s js13kGames-branded, animates nicely, don’t throw any errors in the console, and looks good enough. Vibe coded it super fast with ChatGPT.\n\nAm I back to coding if I didn’t write the code? Who knows, but at least I’m closer to building and releasing some games again. It’s high time as the last Enclave Games creation was Forest Cuties - in June… 2021.\nI’ve focused on writing about the Gamedev.js Jam 2025 this month:\n[10.05] Gamedev.js: Gamedev.js Jam 2025 winners announced!\n\n[11.05] Gamedev.js: Best entries from the Challenges in Gamedev.js Jam 2025\n\n[20.05] Gamedev.js: New Gamedev.js Jam 2025 t-shirt: Balance!\n\n[21.05] Enclave Games: Vibe coding js13kGames shader for the V Shaders challenge\n\n\n\n\nI’m still quite happy about the shader though.\nWinners of the $NOODS challenge in Gamedev.js Jam 2025 were announced, among other challenges.\n\nI’m exploring vibe coding web games, since PotNoodleDev is OP Games ’ AI agent who does exactly that.\nMichelle “MishManners” Duke and Dobuki Gamer streamed playing Gamedev.js Jam 2025 entries on YouTube - you should definitely check those out, and if you recorded something yourself please let us know.\n\nLanding page of Gamedev.js Jam 2026 is already up, along with the relevant Itch page.\nNeuroshimaHex.pl is the official patron of the 20th anniversary edition of Neuroshima Hex in Poland that is planned to be released in September, our logo will land at the back of the box.\nStart the preparations to js13kGames 2025, hopefully with the website’s sources on GitHub.\nVibe code some games, hopefully.",

For example, an NFT Object might store the image URL, its name, and who owns it.When you create an Object (like minting a new NFT), you use something called a ConstructorRef. This is like a special key that lets you set up the Object and decide what rules or resources (like ownership details) it should have.

Setting Safari as your default browser on Mac, iPhone, and iPad ensures a seamless browsing experience across Apple devices, leveraging its speed, privacy features, and deep integration with the Apple ecosystem.\nSafari comes as the pre-installed default browser on a new Mac. If you’ve switched to another browser by mistake or wish to revert to Safari, you can quickly and easily set it back as your default.\nLet’s look at how to make Safari the default browser on your Mac system:\nStep 1: Click the Apple icon on the top left and then System Settings (or System Preferences for older macOS versions).  \n\nStep 2: Click Desktop & Dock > Default web browser.\n\nStep 3: Click Safari from the dropdown menu.\n\nClose the window. And now you are all set to use Safari as your default browser on your Mac system.\nIf you prefer shortcuts, you can use the Spotlight Search feature.\nHere are the steps to use it:\nStep 1: Press Command + Space key to open Spotlight Search box.\n\nStep 2: Type “default web browser” and press Enter.\n\nThis navigates you directly to the System Settings, where you can choose Safari from the dropdown as explained before.\nTo make Safari your default browser on iPad/ iPhone, follow the same steps as shown below:\nNote: For this tutorial, we are using the iPhone to illustrate the steps.\nStep 1: Tap Settings on your iPhone/iPad device.\n\nStep 2: Scroll down and tap on Safari.\n\nStep 3: Tap on Default Browser App.\n\nStep 4: Tap Safari to set it as your default browser.\n\nMaking Safari your default browser on Mac, iPhone, or iPad is a quick way to get a smoother and more secure browsing experience. It has privacy tools built right in, works great with your other Apple services, and it’s easy to set up. If you want to get the best browsing on your devices, Safari is a good choice.",

For example: \"Use 8 lines of code\" and another which offers a greater reward with \"Use 4 lines of code\". I usually manage to complete the level with the lowest maximum line of code and sometimes even less than that which makes me feel great!\nProblem-solving is one of the most important skills a programmer should have as programming is about problem-solving as well as writing lines of code. There is more than one way to solve problems and I wonder what other people's approaches to problem solving are.\nDo you have a particular approach to problem solving? Do you have a step method or something which you follow? What is your approach to solving problems with code?",

Types are the backbone of Rust's safety guarantees, but raw types like i32, String, or Vec<T> can sometimes lack semantic meaning and lead to subtle bugs when misused. Imagine accidentally swapping two integers meant for different purposes, like a user ID and a product ID, in a function call—there’s no compiler safeguard to catch that mistake.  \nEnter type aliases and newtypes: two powerful tools for giving raw types clearer meaning and enforcing type safety.

In this tutorial, we’ll explore how to send emails (with or without attachments) and save them using the DotApp PHP framework, leveraging its Emailer library and Email facade.\nCreate a new module called EmailTest by running:\nphp dotapper.php --create-module=EmailTest\n\nIn the app/config.php file, add the SMTP and IMAP configurations for email functionality:\n// SMTP configuration for sending emails\nConf…",

It’s a small interaction, but it makes the UI feel polished and intentional.\nI wanted to figure out how they were doing it.\nCSS handles the stickiness (with position: sticky), but there’s no built-in way to detect when it happens.\nNo CSS selector*. No JavaScript event.\nI love figuring out how to replicate cool interactions I see on the web—so here’s how to do this one using the magical IntersectionObserver API.\nIt’s widely supported, lightweight, and once you know the trick, you’ll start seeing opportunities to use it everywhere.\n🧠 Read the guide:\nhttps://jakeisonline.com/javascript/detecting-sticky-elements\nHave you tried this approach—or come across similar patterns in the wild?\n* Good news: We’ll soon be able to use container queries to detect when an element becomes sticky.\nBut as of this article’s publishing, it’s only available in Chrome, so you’re stuck with this for now",

By implementing parallel processing for these validations, processing time significantly reduced, enabling logistics managers to finalize transportation plans more efficiently.\nTo achieve this, I leveraged parallelStream, a powerful feature introduced in Java 8. While the specific performance metrics and a deep dive into parallelStream with JMH will be covered in a future post, this article focuses on ForkJoinPool, engi…",

While if-else chains and if-let constructions are perfectly valid and often useful, they can quickly become unwieldy when dealing with complex logic. Enter match, Rust's pattern-matching powerhouse that can simplify your code, make it easier to read, and reduce bugs.\nIn this post, we'll dive deep into how to use match ergonomically to replace verbose if-else chains and nested if statements.

That’s why browser testing tools have become essential for ensuring the success of web apps.\nThe same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code can behave differently depending on the browser and platform. Factors like rendering engines, support for web standards, and device-specific quirks make it nearly impossible to predict how an application will perform without rigorous testing.\nConsider a situation where:\nA button is perfectly aligned in Chrome …",

Managers and engineers made all significant decisions, while front-line workers were expected to \"do as they're told,\" performing narrow tasks without input into process or strategy. Factory workers, often seen as low-status laborers, had little agency beyond their assigned duties. This division meant that problem-solving and innovation were the sole province of experts and senior staff, not the rank-and-file. By the 1930s, the typical American steel mill or machine shop exemplified this top-down structure.

          "description": "A major breakthrough in cancer care is making headlines. Scientists from the US, UK, and Switzerland have developed a cutting-edge test that predicts which men with aggressive, non-metastatic prostate cancer are most likely to benefit from the drug abiraterone. This is significant because while abiraterone can save lives, it also causes serious side effects such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart complications.\nUntil now, doctors had no reliable way to know who should receive the drug. This new test, powered by machine learning, changes that. It analyzes digital images of tumor biopsy samples and identifies a specific biomarker that indicates whether a patient is likely to respond to treatment.\nIn a study involving over one thousand men, the test found that twenty five percent of them had this biomarker. For these patients, abiraterone reduced the risk of death within five years from seventeen percent to nine percent. For the rest, the drug showed little to no effect, meaning they could avoid unnecessary treatment and side effects.\nThe test is designed to work with routine clinical data and can easily be added to existing hospital workflows. It promises to make prostate cancer treatment more precise, sparing patients who do not need aggressive therapies and ensuring those who do get the help they need.\nResearchers also hope the findings will encourage broader approval of abiraterone for early-stage use, especially in the UK where its application has been limited. With this test, the decision becomes more scientific, more ethical, and far more personal.\nRead more here:\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/30/new-ai-test-can-predict-which-men-will-benefit-from-prostate-cancer-drug",

          "description": "When building secure APIs or applications with OAuth 2.0, validating access tokens is a critical step. Two common approaches for token validation are JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) and the Token Introspection Specification (RFC 7662). Each has its strengths, use cases, and trade-offs. In this blog post, we’ll explore both methods, compare their pros and cons, and help you decide which is best for your system.\nPurpose: Validates JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) locally.\nHow It Works: The authorization server exposes a JWKS endpoint (e.g., /.well-known/jwks.json) containing public keys. The resource server uses these keys to verify the JWT’s signature and checks claims like expiration (exp), issuer (iss), and audience (aud).\nKey Feature: No network call is needed for validation after caching the JWKS, making…",

Just click \"Copy Debug Prompt\", paste it into ChatGPT, and get help that makes sense.\nThe plugin hooks into Cypress's failure handling. When a test fails, it captures the error message, test title, relevant stack trace, and even the surrounding context, then wraps it all into a clean, AI-friendly prompt.\nTo see the \"Copy Debug Prompt\" button we have to install the plugin:\nnpm install -D cy-copy-prompt\n\nthen add this line to cypress/support/e2e.js\nimport 'cy-copy-prompt';\n\nNow, whenever a test fails, you'll see a \"Copy Debug Prompt\" button in the Cypress app. One click, and your clipboard is loaded with a prompt that's ready to paste into AI chat.\nPrompt Copied to Clipboard:\n\nThen paste it:\n\nInspired by Playwright's \"Copy Prompt\" feature, this plugin brings the same convenience to Cypress.

          "description": "One of the most common types of noise in digital images is impulse noise, also known as salt-and-pepper noise. This type of noise randomly alters certain pixels in the image by setting them to the minimum or maximum possible intensity values (e.g., 0 and 255 in 8-bit images), while the rest of the pixels remain unchanged.\nApplying a Gaussian filter in these cases is counterproductive. Convolution with a Gaussian kernel smooths the image through a weighted averaging operation, which affects both noisy and non-noisy pixels. This not only fails to effectively remove the noise, but also introduces widespread blurring in the image\nAs an alternative, the median filter offers a much more suitable solution. This filter replaces the value of each pixel with the median of the intensity values of its neighbors within a local window (typically square-shaped). By focusing on the central value of the sorted data, the median filter preserves edges and is highly effective at removing outliers such as those introduced by salt-and-pepper noise.\nThe basic procedure for applying the median filter consists of the following steps:\nFor each pixel, define a local window of size w × w centered on that pixel.\n2.Extract all intensity values within that window.\n3.Sort the values.\n4.Replace the central pixel value with the median of the sorted list.\n\nRead the full article here.",

Today, let’s dive into something more hands-on: threat modeling.\nIf you're not familiar with the term, think of threat modeling as the process of asking, “What can go wrong?” before your AI app is exposed to the real world. For AI systems, this means looking beyond traditional vulnerabilities and into the unique risks that come with using models, training data, and user prompts.\nThreat modeling isn’t new. It’s been a common part of security practices for years. But when it comes to AI, we’re dealing with components that behave differently:\nThe model is dynamic and often unpredictable.\nThe data is unstructured and possibly user-generated.\nThe logic isn’t just written in code — it’s embedded in w…",

This is the story of how I identified the problem, led the creation of a new HTTP client—Traxios—and how this decision positively impacted our team and delivery.\nAt Tractian, our web team relied heavily on Axios for all HTTP requests. Axios provided a familiar, ergonomic API, interceptors, and instance management, making it a staple in our codebase. However, with the release of Next.js 13, the native fetch API was extended with new options like cache and next, enabling advanced caching and revalidation strategies crucial for modern SSR/SSG applications.\nUnfortunately, Axios did not support these Next.js-specific fetch options.

          "description": "In an era where digital experiences shape business outcomes, one quality determines your long-term survival more than anything else Resilience.\nYour infrastructure could be bulletproof. Your application could be cloud-native. But can your system handle unpredictable traffic spikes, cascading failures, or regional outages? That’s where resilience testing steps in.\nWhat Is Resilience Testing?\nResilience testing evaluates how a system behaves under failure conditions. It doesn’t just ask “Does it work?” but “What happens when it breaks?”\nIt simulates:\nServer failures\nNetwork slowdowns\nDependency crashes\nPower outages\nAnd ensures your system recovers gracefully.\nWhy Is It Important?\nModern architectures rely on distributed systems, microservices, and cloud infrastructure. These are fast and scalable but also more complex and interdependent.\nEven a single point of failure like a downed DNS server can lead to hours of downtime. Resilience testing identifies weak links before your users do.\nReal-World Example\nStartups, banks, hospitals all rely on resilient systems to ensure uptime, customer trust, and compliance.\nWhat Should You Test?\nA complete resilience testing strategy includes:\nInfrastructure failure: What if an availability zone goes down?\nApplication failure: What if a microservice crashes?\nNetwork instability: Can services handle latency?\nResource exhaustion: How does your system behave under stress?\nBest Practices\nIntroduce failures gradually.\nMonitor everything latency, error rates, recovery times.\nUse automated tools like Gremlin, Chaos Mesh, or AWS Fault Injection Simulator.\nAlways run post-mortems to fix root causes.\nWhat It Means for You\nIf you're investing in uptime, user experience, and SLA commitments, this should be on your radar.\nWant to learn how Signiance helps teams implement resilience testing at scale?\nthe full blog",

Its types are Number, String, List, Map, and funcRef (ie. a function reference) -- and that's it.\nThat means that when you want to express an Enum type, you may find yourself using magic numbers. You can use Numbers after all -- in fact I would imagine most underlying Enum implementations do in fact use numerical types under the hood -- but if you find yourself writing code like ship.firingMode = 2, you're probably going to be in for a world of hurt when you try to return to your space shooter game after a six month break.

Compiler Design Exam\nThe exam went okayish — not terrible, not amazing. I had been up all night studying, trying to do every last bit of parser theory. As it turns out, SLR and LL parsers showed up, just like I feared. \n2. Explore Circuit Verse Ruby Code\nSo, I am starting a org of the month! And this months organization is Circuit Verse!\nCircuit Verse is an open-source platform I’m exploring for potential GSoC contributions. I focused on understanding their Ruby on Rails backend. It was fascinating to see how simulations, circuit logic, and user interactions are managed behind the scenes. \n\nAlthough Ruby was a bit new to me, the code was clean and well-structured, which made the learning process smoother. I have successfully set up the codebase in my Local System.\n3. Practice 3 DP Questions\n\nI did some Dynamic Programming (DP) problems too. I have realized that consistent daily practice, even if it’s just a handful of problems, adds up over time. It’s all about training your brain to recognize patterns and optimize under constraints.\nOVERALL\nAt least I got the important stuff done, and tomorrow’s a holiday, so I’ll have time to breathe, reset, and maybe catch up a bit.\nSigning Off\nAnisha 💗",

Unlike its predecessor, AlphaFold 3 can model not only proteins but also DNA, RNA, and small molecule interactions. This release is set to transform the fields of structural biology, drug discovery, and synthetic biology.\nThe newly released AlphaFold 3 pipeline allows scientists and engineers to predict complex molecular assemblies with unprecedented accuracy. This includes protein-ligand binding, nucleic acid interactions, and even multi-protein complexes — tasks that were previously the domain of expensive wet-lab experimentation.\nWhat makes AlphaFold 3 particularly exciting for developers is the modular and Python-accessible architecture. Bioinformaticians, AI researchers, and biotech engineers can now directly integrate these models into their workflows, accelerating everything from target identification to molecule design. The fusion of machine learning and biology has never been more seamless.\nAs AI continues to unlock new frontiers in life sciences, AlphaFold 3 sets the stage for a future where protein design and therapeutic discovery can be driven by open, programmable, and intelligent systems.\nhttps://github.com/deepmind/alphafold\nhttps://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphafold-3-predicting-the-shape-and-interactions-of-everything-protein",

          "description": "JavaScript often feels magical to newcomers and even to seasoned developers at times. Some of that “magic” is powered by concepts like lexical scoping and closures—two foundational principles that give JavaScript its flexibility and strength.\nUnderstanding these concepts not only makes you a better developer, but also unlocks the door to writing more elegant, efficient, and bug-free code.\nIn this article, we’ll demystify lexical scoping and closures, demonstrate how they work under the hood, and show you how to harness them like a pro.\nWhat is Lexical Scoping?\n\n\nLexical scoping means that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code—not where or how it's called.\nWhen JavaScript compiles your code, it organizes variables into nested scopes based on where they phy…",

          "description": "NVIDIA has just announced native support for Python in its CUDA platform, marking a major shift in how developers can access GPU acceleration. For the first time, Python developers can write CUDA programs without needing to rely on C or C++ bindings. This native integration drastically lowers the barrier for using GPUs in scientific computing, AI, and data-heavy Python applications.\nThe new cuda-python package gives direct access to CUDA’s driver and runtime APIs, letting users launch kernels, manage memory, and control streams entirely from Python. It also includes support for just-in-time (JIT) compilation, which means you can write dynamic GPU code directly in Python, compile it on the fly, and run it immediately.\nA key innovation is the new CuTile programming model, which brings a tile-based structure to CUDA operations. CuTile is designed to feel natural to Python users familiar with NumPy and CuPy, and it allows for efficient manipulation of large data arrays without needing to manage threads manually.\nThis move brings CUDA closer to Python’s ecosystem and could reshape how GPU computing is taught, deployed, and scaled across AI and HPC workloads.\nRead the full announcement here:\nhttps://thenewstack.io/nvidia-finally-adds-native-python-support-to-cuda/\nOfficial documentation from NVIDIA:\nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-python",

          "description": "React 19 has officially landed, and it brings a ton of exciting new features and improvements that elevate both developer experience and app performance. After over a year of updates in the React 18.x line, React 19 solidifies the groundwork with innovations aimed at simplifying component logic, improving server-side rendering, and streamlining form handling.\nIn this blog, we’ll explore the most important features of React 19 and how they impact modern frontend development.\n🔥 1. Actions for Forms: Server-first Data Mutations\n✅ Benefits:\nServer and client logic remain in sync.\nSimplifies the mental model for forms.\n🧪 Example:\nexport async function createPost(formData) {\nCreate Post\n🧠 2. useOptimistic: Better UX for Async Updates\n🚀 Use Case:\n💡 Example:\n{\n    addOptimisticTodo({ title: inputValue });\n🔄 3. useFormStatus and useFormState: Form Helpers\nuseFormStatus\njsx\njsx\n🌐 4. Improved Server Components\n💼 Key Benefits:\nImproved initial load performance.\nEnhanced support in Next.js App Router and other frameworks.\n📦 5. Asset Loading with \nWhy it matters:\nNative  support in JSX means tighter integration with the browser's preload pipeline.\njsx\n🧹 7. Cleanup and Breaking Changes\nLegacy context API (pre-React 16.3) is fully removed.\nReactDOM.render is now replaced with createRoot.\nBetter error boundaries and async rendering behavior.\n📈 Final Thoughts\nWhether you're building SPAs or full-stack apps with frameworks like Next.js or Remix, React 19 is ready to supercharge your developer experience.\n🙌 Ready to Migrate?\nReact 19 is now stable, and most major frameworks have either added or are adding support. Start experimenting today, especially with server actions and useFormState, to see the benefits in real-time.",

Why switch from Chrome?”\nBut once I realized this was an experimental browser from Opera testing out agent-like AI features, I figured it was worth a look.\nI found the official info on Opera’s site. If you're trying to download Opera Neon, don’t get too excited — it's invite-only for now.\nOpera’s been building browsers since the ’90s, but this might be their most ambitious idea yet.\nThe previews show a minimalist design and AI baked right in. It looks... different — in a good way.\nThe Opera Neon UI looks like it was designed to end tab chaos.\nYou get visual tabs that show a preview of each page, which makes jumping between websites feel more intuitive than just staring at a bunch of favicons.\nThere’s also a floating sidebar that holds key tools like bookmarks, workspace controls, and the AI assistant — all tucked neatly to the side without taking up valuable screen real estate.\nAnd that’s just scratching the surface.\nWant to know how Opera Neon uses AI to organize your tabs, issue distraction warnings, and even make activity-based suggestions?\nRead the full deep dive here:\n\nOpera Neon 2025: AI Browser Review\nThis article was originally published on patangrid.site and is syndicated here for broader reach.",

While AI promises innovation and efficiency, it also presents significant challenges that require urgent attention.\nUp to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs risk displacement due to automation, with unemployment potentially rising to 20%, a rate not seen since the Great Depression (Anthropic CEO Dario Amod).\nCurrently, 14% of the global workforce—approximately 375 million workers—have been affected by AI through job losses or career changes, with around 5 million jobs lost worldwide.\nThe most impacted sectors include customer service (1.2 million jobs lost), IT services (850,000), warehousing and logistics (1.1 million), administrative and clerical roles (750,000), banking (400,000), and retail (300,000).\nWomen’s jobs are disproportionately vulnerable, with 41% of female roles at risk compared to 28% for men, reflecting the higher concentration of women in automatable sectors.\nAttempts by companies like Clara and IBM to fully replace human roles with AI have demonstrated the limitations of automation, highlighting the continued importance of human skills.\nLooking ahead, by 2026, AI is projected to displace 75 million jobs globally but create 133 million new jobs, emphasizing a shift toward roles requiring new and different skills.\nThis transition risks exacerbating inequality, favoring those with greater education and resources, and posing a challenge for inclusive economic growth.\nThe path forward requires coordinated action:\nAccelerated workforce retraining and upskilling programs\nThoughtful regulation of AI adoption\nStrategic planning to ensure equitable opportunities in the evolving job market\nAs AI continues to evolve, organizations and governments must collaborate to create a future of work that balances innovation with inclusivity and social responsibility.\nHow is your organization preparing for the impact of AI on jobs?",

          "description": "No artigo de hoje, vamos falar sobre uma prática da qual eu já fui vítima, e você, leitor, provavelmente também já foi (ou ainda está sendo).\nTrata-se da famigerada prática de criar endpoints excessivamente verbosos. Quando estamos desenvolvendo uma API REST para nosso sistema, é comum tentarmos facilitar o acesso a dados muito específicos. No entanto, isso muitas vezes se transforma em uma bola de neve.\nQuem nunca se pegou pensando: “Só mais um endpoint e tudo estará resolvido”... e repetiu isso incontáveis vezes?\nIsso acontece porque ignoramos um fator muito importante no conceito de API: ela deve servir como um portal de acesso aos recursos gerais do sistema, e não como um grande servidor repleto de rotas altamente específicas para cada situação.\nEsse problema costuma surgir, principalmente, quando lidamos com recursos que estão relacionados entre si.\nPense na seguinte situação:\nVocê precisa listar usuários que possuem tarefas atribuídas. A abordagem comum e tentadora é criar um endpoint como:\n/getUsersWithTasks\nMas esse tipo de design fere princípios fundamentais de uma API bem construída. Em vez disso, pense na sua API como uma interface para recursos, e usuários são um recurso. Logo, uma forma mais adequada e escalável seria algo como:\n/users?withTasks=true\nEsse formato segue o padrão REST, é mais flexível e permite expandir facilmente os filtros no futuro, como:\n/users?withTasks=true&active=true\nEvite criar endpoints com verbos como get, delete ou create. Além de quebrar os princípios REST, isso torna sua API redundante e desnecessariamente verbosa. Por exemplo:\n🚫 /getUserById\nAlém disso:\nPrefira filtros via query parameters em vez de encher a URL com parâmetros.\nMantenha seus endpoints focados em recursos, não em ações.\nSeguindo essas dicas simples, sua API se tornará muito mais limpa, intuitiva, escalável e fácil de manter.",

          "description": "Google, founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University, has become one of the most influential technology companies in history. Originally launched as a search engine, Google transformed how people access and interact with information online.\nAt the heart of Google's success is its powerful search algorithm, which ranks web pages based on relevance and authority. This innovation not only made Google the go-to search engine globally but also revolutionized the digital marketing industry through platforms like Google Ads and Google Analytics.\nOver the years, Google expanded far beyond search. It developed the Android operating system, now the most widely used mobile OS, acquired YouTube to dominate online video, and introduced Gmail, Google Maps, Chrome, and the Google Workspace suite. Each of these tools became a cornerstone of modern digital life.\nThe company’s parent organization, Alphabet Inc., was created in 2015 to oversee a broader range of ventures, including artificial intelligence (DeepMind), autonomous vehicles (Waymo), and life sciences (Verily). Google continues to lead in AI, with products like Google Assistant and its recent work on generative AI models.\nHowever, Google's dominance has also sparked concerns over privacy, market monopoly, and data ethics. Antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. and abroad highlight the tension between innovation and regulation in the digital era.\nToday, Google remains a symbol of innovation and connectivity, shaping how billions of people learn, communicate, and do business. Whether it’s through search, cloud computing, or AI, Google's impact on the modern world is profound and enduring.",

          "description": "I’ve been exploring an idea for a fully automated AI-powered cryptocurrency trading system that could be built entirely using free and publicly available services. The concept combines Groq AI for ultra-fast decision-making, a free crypto news API to analyze real-time market sentiment, and exchange APIs like Binance’s to execute live trades and monitor balances.\nThe system would automatically analyze trends, interpret news, and make informed trading decisions in real time. It would also include a web-based dashboard to display capital status, trade logs, AI insights, and profit and loss — all updated live for full transparency.\nThe goal is to create a highly efficient, intelligent, and low-cost crypto trading setup using freely accessible tools and APIs. It’s still just an idea at this stage, but I believe it has strong potential. I’m interested in feedback, collaboration, or hearing from others working on similar concepts.\nhashtag#Crypto hashtag#AI hashtag#Automation hashtag#TradingBot hashtag#GroqAI hashtag#BinanceAPI hashtag#CryptoNews hashtag#TechIdeas hashtag#Innovation hashtag#WebDashboard",

Instead of overprovisioning (and overpaying) or dealing with performance issues during traffic spikes, you set rules that let Azure do the scaling for you. \nAzure supports autoscaling for several services: \nApp Services \nVirtual Machine Scale Sets \nAzure Kubernetes Service (AKS) \nAzure Functions \nIn this guide, we’ll focus on App Service autoscaling, since it’s one o…",

They’re TradFi in a blockchain costume.\nHere’s the inconvenient truth:\nWant to buy tokenized real estate? Great. But that token doesn’t give you squat unless a legal entity off-chain honors it.\nTreasury tokens? Same thing. You’re trusting a fund manager, custodian, or regulatory body to redeem it.\nIt’s not trustless. It’s regulatory theater with a smart contract backend.\nRWAs are less about empowering users and more about navigating global compliance.\nIt’s not about breaking the system. It’s about bending the rules just enough to extract value while pretending to be futuristic.\nThis isn’t DeFi. It’s just TradFi with faster accounting.\nLet’s be honest: most RWA projects don’t need a blockchain. They use it for:\nToken issuance\nCap table management\nTracking asset flow\nBut these are things spreadsheets and CRMs have done for decades.\nPutting it onchain doesn’t make it revolutionary — it just makes it buzzword-compliant.\nWeb3 wasn’t about rehypothecating bonds or making banks more efficient. It was about disintermediation.\nCutting out the middlemen. Giving power back to users. Trustless systems.\nRWAs? They reintroduce the middlemen — they just wear hoodies now.\nTokenized RWAs sound sexy, but they’re just Wall Street playing dress-up in Web3.\nUntil these assets are truly decentralized — not just onchain — they’ll remain more TradFi than DeFi.",

What is a Program?\n\n\nA program is a list of instructions that a computer runs step by step.\nTo write a program in Python, we write instructions using Python’s rules (called syntax). The instructions tell the computer what to do with data (numbers, text, etc.).\n3. What is Data?\n\n\nData is information — like:\nNumbers (10)\nText (\"hello\")\nTrue/False values (True, False)\nEvery piece of data has a type.

It used to be that developers would spend a ton of time just translating what a designer made into code. Now, AI can take those designs and spit out production-ready code in a fraction of the time. This means projects can move a lot faster, and teams aren't stuck in that slow back-and-forth process. It's like having a super-fast assistant that understands design and can write code.

Or you can try counting all the numbers in order—1, 2, 3, 4…—this will still take 10 guesses max, but in a more systematic way.\nBut what if you had to guess a number from 1 to 1000, or even 1 to a million? What about 1 to 10²⁰? As the range increases, brute force becomes impractical.\nComputer scientists faced the same problem: how do you efficiently find something in a huge range?

That’s what we’ll dive into next.\n🧱 Queue Types & Use Cases\n🎯 Simple Queue\n• Behavior: FIFO\n🔁 Circular Queue\n• Behavior: FIFO with a circular buffer (head connects to tail)\n⏫ Priority Queue\n• Behavior: Elements are served based on priority\n🔄 Deque (Double-Ended Queue)\n• Behavior: Can insert/remove from both ends\n🤝 Concurrent Queue\n• Behavior: Thread-safe queue for multi-threaded systems\n🧵 Curious about thread-safe? It means multiple threads can access the queue without data corruption or race conditions.\n📩 Message Queue (Job Queue)\n• Behavior: Asynchronous communication between producers & consumers\n🛠 Practical Examples & Code\nEach queue is implemented in clean Python code in this GitHub repository:\nqueue-patterns GitHub Repo\nAll implementations include:\n📍 Why This Matters\nToo often, people use one kind of queue for everything.

This third post introduces you to list context in XS.\nWhat do I mean by list context?\nIn Perl, there are two main contexts in which a function can be called: scalar context and list context. Scalar context means that the function is expected to return a single value, while list context means that the function is expected to return a list of values.\nIn XS, list context is a bit more complex than scalar context. When a function is called in list context, it can return multiple values, so in XS you need to push each value onto the stack. This is done by manipulating ST and using the 'XSRETURN' macro, which takes the number of values to return as an argument. I will …",

As a \"divide and conquer\" algorithm, it works by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the array around it. Unlike Merge Sort, which always divides arrays exactly in half, Quick Sort's divisions depend on the chosen pivot.\nQuick Sort offers average-case time complexity of O(n log n) with in-place sorting capability, requiring only O(log n) additional memory for the recursion stack. However, its performance can degrade to O(n²) in worst-case scenarios, which makes pivot selection strategy important for optimal performance.\nThe tone of this article is assumes you are already familiar with Recursion.

For many developers, it becomes a nostalgic memory — one tied to discovery, frustration, creativity, and the thrill of solving problems for the first time. Whether it was the blinking cursor of a BASIC interpreter, a Python “Hello, World,” or writing HTML in a notepad file, that first step into code often shapes how we see technology and continue to learn it.\nSo, let’s talk about it:\nWhat was your first programming language, and what got you started with it?\nMaybe it was a class assignment, a YouTube tutorial, a book someone gave you, or pure curiosity. Some of us started with languages that are now considered “old school,” while others dove in through newer, high-level languages designed to be beginner-friendly. Some were drawn in by game modding, others by web development, and some just wanted to automate tedious tasks.\nAnd how do you feel about that first language now? Was it a good starting point? Would you recommend it to beginners today, or do you wish you’d started with something else?\nShare your story in the comments below.\nI’d love to hear what language kicked off your programming journey!",

          "description": "E aí, devs! Hoje falo um pouco mais sobre o projeto que estou criando que envolve desenvolvimento full-stack e cloud: meu novo Portfólio Pessoal com Blog e CMS integrados. E o melhor: todo o deploy será feito na AWS, transformando este projeto em uma experiência completa, do código à nuvem!\nO Projeto: Visão Geral\nA idéia é criar uma plataforma completa unificada para exibir meus trabalhos e compartilhar conhecimento técnico. O sistema é composto por:\n\nBackend (API): Uma API robusta e completa desenvolvida com Node.js, TypeScript e Express. Ela já está pronta e lidando com posts do blog, tags, autenticação para o CMS (via JWT com bcryptjs), e até mesmo o envio de e-mails do formulário de contato usando AWS SES. Tudo isso conectado a um banco de dados PostgreSQL.\nFrontend (React): Uma interface de usuário responsiva, construída com React e TypeScript, utilizando Vite para agilidade no desenvolvimento. O frontend consome a API para mostrar os posts, o formulário de contato, e em breve, a seção de portfólio e o painel de gerenciamento de conteúdo (CMS).\nTecnologias no Comando 🛠️\nNo Backend (API):\nLinguagem: TypeScript\nRuntime: Node.js\nFramework: Express.js\nBanco de Dados: PostgreSQL\nAutenticação: JWT + bcryptjs\nServiços AWS: SES (para e-mails)\nNo Frontend\nBiblioteca: React.js\nLinguagem: TypeScript\nBuild Tool: Vite\nRoteamento: react-router-dom\nEste projeto não é apenas um portfólio; é um campo de aprendizado prático para arquitetura de software, boas práticas e, crucialmente, operações DevOps com foco em AWS. O backend já está 100% funcional, e o frontend está evoluindo rapidamente.\nQuer dar uma olhada no código para ver a evolução? O repositório está aqui: https://github.com/marcelomagario/portfolio\nNos próximos posts, vou compartilhar mais sobre cada detalhes de cada tarefas e também os desafios do caminho. Valeu!",

Since then, I’ve tinkered with Docker, Git, Bash, and solved a few problems in C and Python. That’s the extent of my progress so far.  \nMy plan? Combine the course with open resources like DE ZoomCamp. I also want to try the LLM ZoomCamp — apparently, RAG is that tech I wanted to learn but didn't know its name. Heh.\nTurns out, my API knowledge is… nonexistent. Who knew there was more to APIs than just REST? 😴😅\n\n\nI still second-guess myself in basic Python sometimes...  \n\n\n\nFor example, this question tripped me up earlier. I didn’t have an interpreter at hand, so I went with intuition. Surprisingly, my intuition was right.\nQ: Is this code valid?\nclass demo(list):\n    def __test__(self, key):\n        return []\na = demo()\na['test'] = 7\nprint(a)\n\n\n\n  \nStill believe that coding is often an experimental science: you learn by running code.\nCompared namespace vs. scope today. They’re both about name visibility, but:  \nNamespaces are explicit containers (to avoid conflicts).  \n\n\nScopes are implicit, tied to code blocks (where a name is accessible).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  ⚙️ Plans for tomorrow\n\n\nStill wrestling with my environment setup — nothing feels quite right yet. \nMaybe tomorrow I'll do something about it finally and will be able to complete more than just a few random coding questions in Google Colab.",

But real-world programming often reveals a subtler truth: duplication frequently moves through codebases with more elegance than purists acknowledge.\nDuplication simplifies certain tasks. Yes, fixing a bug in duplicated code means multiple edits. But altering shared code can quietly destabilize distant parts of your system. Duplication offers localized safety, while abstraction carries global risks.\nBoth abstraction and duplication can be reversed, though abstractions typically cling stubbornly once established.\nSometimes identical code blocks appear similar yet carry distinct meanings.

          "description": "In the world of software development, designing a scalable and maintainable architecture is crucial for building a successful application. One approach to achieve this is by using containerization with Docker. In this article, we'll explore the benefits of using containerized Java microservices and provide a step-by-step guide on how to implement this architecture.\nIdentify the microservices: Break down your application into smaller, independent services that can be developed, tested, and deployed separately.\nChoose a containerization platform: Select a suitable containerization platform, such as Docker, and install it on your development environment.\nCreate a Dockerfile: Write a Dockerfile that defines the instructions for building and running your microservice.\nBuild and run the container: Use the Dockerfile to build a Docker image and run the container.\nIntegrate with other services: Integrate the containerized microservice with other services in your application.\nBy following these steps, you can design a scalable and maintainable Java microservice architecture using containerization with Docker.

In Part 1, we laid the groundwork; now, in Part 2, we're diving into the critical concept of encryption at rest.\nSimply put, encryption at rest in Kubernetes refers to how the API server encrypts data before storing it in etcd. Think of etcd as the brain of your Kubernetes cluster - it's where all your cluster's configuration data, state, and secrets live.\nBy default, the Kubernetes API server stores resources in etcd as plain text. This means if someone gains unauthorized access to your etcd, they can read all your sensitive data, including secrets, without any effort. This is a significant security risk.\nWhile encryption at rest applies to any Kubernetes resource, in this series, we'll continue to focus on Secrets …",

By sampling DNA from some of the planet’s most remote and untouched ecosystems, the company has identified over one million previously unknown species. These discoveries are not just academic. They are fueling a next-generation AI platform designed to radically accelerate drug discovery.\nThe company’s genomic database is already among the largest of its kind. It is being used to train AI models that predict protein structures, functions, and interactions at unprecedented accuracy. This includes boosting tools like AlphaFold, which helps researchers visualize the shape of proteins based on genetic code alone.\nA major focus of the project is the identification of new large serine recombinases, a type of enzyme that can precisely insert large DNA sequences into the genome. These enzymes are considered highly promising for future gene therapies, including for cancer and rare genetic disorders.\nBasecamp Research is also trying to set a new standard in ethical science. The team works directly with local researchers and governments in the regions where DNA samples are collected. In return, partner countries receive royalties and scientific credit, avoiding the extractive models of earlier biotech ventures.\nThis combination of field biology, advanced sequencing, and deep learning could reshape how we find drugs, understand evolution, and build genetic tools. It is a powerful example of how AI, when paired with real-world data, can help uncover the deepest layers of life on Earth.\nRead the full story here:\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/9765ab86-0156-4901-b6ec-fbee465ab819",

From its boxy design, premium materials, to trendy features that closely resemble flagship phones, OPPO seems to have found a new winning formula for 2025. But behind all that resemblance, is the Reno13 5G just style over substance or does it truly deserve to be called a high-end smartphone? Let’s dive deep!\nHow Much is the OPPO Reno13 5G?\nOPPO’s New Strategy: iPhone Inspiration + Find X8 Touches\nIf the Find X8 was praised for its design, performance, and software, Reno 13 5G inherits the same DNA.

In Next.js you just create a folder in the app directory and name it based on your route name (ex: about,dashboard), No boilerplate code needed.\nFor SEO and performance, Next.js uses SSR and static generation. It can pre-render HTML on the server, which loads faster and is more SEO-friendly. Dynamic pages can also be server-rendered in chunks — Next figures out what to serve based on the user's request and only sends what's needed. If a page uses use client, the server sends that component's JavaScript to the browser, which then renders it client-side.\nBy the way on what tech do you build frontend?",

          "description": "Sure! Here's a simple and beginner-friendly blog post about learning arrays and length in programming. This example is based on JavaScript, but I can adapt it to another language if you prefer.\nIf you're just starting your programming journey, two important concepts you'll often hear are arrays and length. Let’s break them down in a simple way.\nAn array is a way to store multiple values in a single variable.\nlet fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"];\n\nHere, fruits is an array that holds 3 values:\n\"apple\"\n\"banana\"\n\"cherry\"\nYou can think of an array like a box with compartments. Each compartment has a number (called an index), and it holds one item.\n\n\n\nIndex\nValue\n\n\n\n\n0\n\"apple\"\n\n\n1\n\"banana\"\n\n\n2\n\"cherry\"\n\n\n\n🧠 Remember: Indexes start at 0, not 1.\nWant to get \"banana\"? You use its index:\nconsole.log(fruits[1]); // Output: banana\n\nEvery array has a property called length, which tells you how many items are inside.\nconsole.log(fruits.length); // Output: 3\n\nEven if you don’t know what's in the array, .length helps you find out how many items it contains.\nYou can add new items using .push() and remove with .pop():\nfruits.push(\"mango\"); // Adds \"mango\" to the end\nconsole.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"mango\"]\n\nfruits.pop(); // Removes the last item (\"mango\")\nconsole.log(fruits); // [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n\nYou can loop through arrays using a for loop:\nfor (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {\n  console.log(fruits[i]);\n}\n\nAn array stores multiple values in one variable.\nYou access values using index numbers, starting from 0.\nUse .length to find how many items are in the array.\nArrays are super useful for organizing data and are used in almost every programming language!\nLet me know if you'd like this blog translated into Hindi, Tamil, or another language, or if you want examples in Python, Java, or C++.",

          "description": "One of the most common ways to optimize the size of an application's bundle is code splitting. With code splitting, we divide the application into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This allows us to reduce the amount of JavaScript that needs to be downloaded and parsed when the user first opens the app.\nA simple and widely used approach to code splitting is splitting by page. The logic is straightforward: when a user opens Page A, there’s no need to load the code for Page B at that moment. This approach provides a significant improvement in initial load time, which is especially important for large applications.\nHowever, like any solution, this method comes with trade-offs. While first-time loading becomes faster, navigating between pages can feel slower. When the user switches …",
