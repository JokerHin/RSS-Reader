File permissions are a cornerstone of Linux security, ensuring that only the right people can access or modify critical files. Whether you're a budding sysadmin or a curious developer, understanding how Linux handles file access is crucial to maintaining control and security.\nLet’s break it down 👇\nLinux file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Each file or directory is governed by three levels of access:\nOwner (User) – The creator of the file.\nGroup – Users who belong to the assigned group.\nOthers – Everyone else.\nPermissions are represented in two ways:\nRead (r or 4) – View file contents.\nWrite (w or 2) – Modify file contents.\nExecute (x or …",

It enables engineers to streamline deployments, manage system configurations, monitor processes, and orchestrate complex workflows with precision.

So, I built a free web tool that lets you upload any image (or use a sample), and it instantly gives you a palette of the most important colors – in HEX, RGB, HSL, etc.\nYou can choose between different extraction methods (Vibrant, Material Design, Median Cut, K-Means) depending on what kind of palette you want. It works right in your browser, and nothing gets uploaded to a server.\nTry it here: https://colorsfromimage.xyz/\nWould love to hear what you think!\nIs it useful for your workflow?\nAny features you wish it had?\nFound any bugs or weird results?\nI’m open to all feedback, and if you make something cool with it, please share!

          "description": "Ever wrestled with a RAG pipeline and thought, “Why is this so damn hard?” We’ve been there—tearing our hair out over complexity and slow performance. So, I built Dcup, an open-source, self-hostable RAG-as-a-Service platform that actually works Very good.\nIt’s a tool to hook your app up to user data with zero bullshit. Here’s the rundown:\nTech Stack: Next.js, BullMQ for job queues, OpenAI for embeddings, and Qdrant for vector storage. It’s lean, mean, and scales like a dream.\n\n\nKiller Features: AI-driven retrieval and hybrid search that cuts through the noise. Plus, optional re-ranking if you’re a precision freak.\nLearn more\n\n\n\nAt its core, Dcup is your bridge to smarter data handling. It takes the complexity out of RAG pipelines by automating the heavy lifting. Here’s how it works in plain English:\nData Ingestion: Hook up your data sources—think Google Drive, AWS, or wherever your files live—and Dcup keeps it all synced and current.\nData Processing: Your raw data gets chopped into bite-sized chunks and turned into embeddings using OpenAI. (More on embeddings later—they’re cool!)\nStorage & Indexing: Those embeddings land in Qdrant, a lightning-fast vector database that makes searching a breeze.\nAdvanced Retrieval: Need answers fast? Features like re-ranking and hybrid search dig up the most relevant info in seconds.\nThink of Dcup as your personal AI assistant that organizes, understands, and retrieves your data like a pro.\nBig files used to choke us. Performance would tank, and we’d be staring at spinning wheels. Then we got smart—batching and parallel processing turned it around. Now, Dcup eats large datasets for breakfast.\nThis isn’t some corporate ad. It’s a project by dev not shitty vibe coding or whatever the kids call it these days.\nStar the repo if it vibes with you: Dcup on GitHub.  \nWanna contribute? Hit me up! Let’s make RAG pipelines suck less together.",

This release represents a significant advancement in how PHP applications can handle HTTP requests, with powerful new features for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.\nWhen we first created Fetch PHP, our goal was simple: to bring the elegance and simplicity of JavaScript's fetch API to the PHP ecosystem. Frontend developers have long enjoyed the intuitive nature of fetch() for making HTTP requests, and we wanted backend developers to have the same experience.\nWith version 3.0, we've taken this vision even further by enhancing the library with more powerful features while maintaining the clean, intuiti…",

While the cover price is straightforward, the actual value can vary significantly when you consider the number of pages in each volume. A $20 comic might contain 100 pages, while another at the same price point offers 400 pages. To solve this practical problem, we'll develop a TypeScript program that calculates and compares the price per page, helping collectors make data-driven purchasing decisions. The complete source code for this project is available on GitHub.\nUsing this approach, I bought four 400-plus-page comics for $85 total, including shipping costs. The implementation focuses on the Wildberries e-commerce platform, which serves Eastern European markets. The code structure is modular,…",

          "description": "In the previous video Quick introduction to isomorphic-validation javascript library I demonstrated how quickly a user-friendly form can be created with UI effects connected to fields' validity states. \nThis is the second part in which I wanted to touch:\nworking with asynchronous validators;\nconditional execution of validators;\nhandling password and password confirmation fields.\nSee the playground with the code from the video.\nIn this video I showed how a typical sign-up logic can be implemented such as checking an e-mail for being already occupied before submitting a form to create a new account.\nAsynchronous validators are handled in the same way as synchronous, you only need to keep in mind that their execution takes time. We are simply playing with timings to create UI effects such as showing loaders/spinners while a request is being processed.\nIt is recommended to execute asynchronous validators conditionally when they are mixed with synchronous. For that, this library provides a feature that implements a simple logic: following validators can not be \"valid\" without the preceding being \"valid\", therefore it is not necessary to execute them. For example, it doesn't make sense to make a request to the server to check if an e-mail already registered if it doesn't conform to the E-mail format. Also, you don't have to worry about an async validator retrieving an irrelevant result if the user keeps typing while the request is being processed. The library handles such edge cases for you.\nHandling fields with validity states depending on each other, such as password and password confirmation, is as easy as handling one field. Also, if you need to implement the logic of one field depending on another it is possible using an auxiliary Validation object.",

          "description": "The main difference between structs and classes in Swift lies in the way they store and manage data (value type vs. reference type), as well as additional features that only classes have.\nHere are the main differences:\nData Storage\nvalue type(independent copy)\nExample: var a1 = b1 creates a new copy\nclass \nExample Value Type (struct):\nstruct Person {\n    var name: String\n}\n\nvar person1 = Person(name: \"Andry\")\nvar person2 = person1\nperson2.name = \"Budi\"\n\nprint(person1.name) // Andry\nprint(person2.name) // Budi\n\n\nExample Reference Type (class):\nclass Person {\n    var name: String\n    init(name: String) {\n        self.name = name\n    }\n}\n\nvar person1 = Person(name: \"Andry\")\nvar person2 = person1\nperson2.name = \"Budi\"\n\nprint(person1.name) // Budi\nprint(person2.name) // Budi\n\n2.Inheritance \nExample:\nclass Animal {\n    var name: String = \"Unknown\"\n}\n\nclass Dog: Animal {\n    var breed: String = \"Bulldog\"\n}\n\n\n3.Deinitializers\nclass MyClass {\n    deinit {\n        print(\"Object is being deallocated\")\n    }\n}\n\n\n4.Mutability (Data Changes)\nstruct Counter {\n    var count = 0\n\n    mutating func increment() {\n        count += 1\n    }\n}\n\n\nIf you're building a Swift/iOS app, most data models can simply use structs. But for UI components and complex logic with inheritance, classes are more appropriate.",

Recently, I worked on a project where I had to dive into a poorly structured codebase with inconsistent patterns, unnecessary complexity, and minimal documentation. Here's what I learned from that experience and how you can approach your next messy project with more confidence.\nBefore diving into solutions, it's important to identify the problems. In my case, the issues included:\nDuplicated logic scattered across files\nInconsistent naming conventions\nLong, unreadable functions\nLack of separation of concerns (e.g., business logic mixed with UI logic)\nNo clear module or folder structure\nZero documentation or inline comments\nIt wasn’t broken, but i…",

          "description": "We all know that Python tuples are immutable—once created, you can't change their values directly. But what if you need to change their content?\nMost tutorials will tell you:\nt = (1, 2, 3)\nmutable_version = list(t)\n\nSure, this works. But let's explore other techy and creative ways to work with immutable data by transforming or decomposing tuples—without always falling back to a boring list().\nSometimes, you need both index and value. Dictionaries are mutable and can be a neat transformation:\nt = (\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\")\nd = dict(enumerate(t))\nd[1] = \"blueberry\"\nprint(tuple(d.values()))  # ('apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry')\n\nUseful if you're working with positional elements and need to mutate by index.\nAnother way is to decompose the tuple manually:\na, b, c = (10, 20, 30)\nb = 200\nt_new = (a, b, c)\nprint(t_new)  # (10, 200, 30)\n\nSimple but powerful — and keeps the tuple form intact. You can even use *args if you don’t know the length in advance.\ncollections.namedtuple (Bonus Tip!)\n\n\nWant tuples with names and some flexibility?\nfrom collections import namedtuple\n\nPoint = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])\np = Point(1, 2)\np = p._replace(x=10)\nprint(p)  # Point(x=10, y=2)\n\nYou’re still using an immutable structure, but _replace lets you mutate-like-update with elegance.\nYes, list() is the go-to way, but you can also:\nConvert to dict if indexes matter.\nUnpack and rebuild for control.\nUse namedtuple and _replace() for readable, structured code.\nNext time someone says \"just convert it to a list\", hit them with these smarter tools. 😉",

          "description": "Have you ever wanted to use AI in your Go (Golang) programs? It may sound hard, but with LangChainGo, it’s actually very easy. In this post, I will show you a simple example to get started.\nLangChainGo is a Go library that helps you use language models (like Google AI, OpenAI, etc.) in your Go programs. You can give it a prompt (a question or a message), and it will give you an answer using AI.\nWe will write a small Go program that asks AI to explain something in simple terms. In this case, we ask:\n\"Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms\"\nThe AI will give us an answer we can print.\nHere is the full code:\npackage main\n\nimport (\n    \"context\"\n    \"fmt\"\n    \"log\"\n    \"os\"\n\n    \"github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms\"\n    \"github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/googleai\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n    ctx := context.Background()\n    apiKey := os.Getenv(\"API_KEY\")\n    llm, err := googleai.New(ctx, googleai.WithAPIKey(apiKey))\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    prompt := \"Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms\"\n    answer, err := llms.GenerateFromSinglePrompt(ctx, llm, prompt)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n\n    fmt.Println(answer)\n}\n\nFirst, it sets up a context.\nIt gets your Google AI API key from the environment (API_KEY).\nThen it creates a connection to the AI using the LangChainGo library.\nIt sends a prompt to the AI.\nThe AI gives an answer.\nWe print the answer.\nWhen I run the code, I get something like:\n\"Quantum entanglement is when two tiny particles are connected in a special way, so if you do something to one, the other changes instantly, no matter how far apart they are.\"\nAmazing, right? With just a few lines of code, you can use the power of AI!\nLangChainGo makes it very easy to use AI in Go. You don’t need to be an expert in machine learning or AI. If you know some Go, you can get started right away.\nLet me know if you try it out or if you have any questions!",

Here's how to build a comprehensive testing strategy for auth flows.\nRegistration typically involves:\nForm validation\nAccount creation\nEmail verification\nInitial profile setup\nThe verification step tends to be the trickiest. We've developed a streamlined approach using dedicated testing mailboxes that reliably receive verification emails, making our tests deterministic instead of flaky.\nTest various scenarios:\nSuccessful login\nInvalid credentials\nAccount lockout\nPassword recovery\nMFA adds complexity:\nSMS verification\nAuthenticator apps\nEmail codes\nRecovery methods\nThis often breaks automation due to email dependencies. Our solution involves pre-provisioned mailboxes that can be programmatically checked for reset links.\nIsolate email dependencies: Use a separate email testing system rather than production email providers.\nCreate isolated test accounts with predictable states\nTest security boundaries, not just happy paths\nSimulate API failures intentionally\nI've compiled these practices while working on a massive authentication system overhaul. The email verification part was solved with a specialized system — those interested in a similar approach can check my setup (hint: it involves omypost).\nWhat authentication edge cases have you found important to test?

After working with dozens of QA teams, I've identified the most common automation pitfalls.\nInconsistent environments lead to inconsistent results. Containerization helps, but doesn't solve everything.\nPerhaps the most notorious bottleneck. Tests that need to validate email verification flows often:\nRely on actual inbox access\nNeed to parse verification codes\nBreak when email delivery is delayed\nRequire complex maintenance\nWe solved this by implementing a dedicated testing mailbox system (similar to what I found at omypost.com), allowing us to generate unlimited testing inboxes on demand.\nThird-party APIs often impose rate limits that throttle your tests.\nCreating, maintaining, and cleaning test data consumes excessive resources.\nRunning tests sequentially wastes precious time.\nOf all these pitfalls, email verification testing offered our greatest efficiency gain. By switching to a dedicated email testing service, we:\nEliminated manual account creation\nAutomated verification code extraction\nEnsured reliable email delivery\nScaled tests without hitting provider limits\nWhat automation bottlenecks have you overcome?

I’ve fixed all the bugs. Look, we just enter a date, and — “ He typed “March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST” into the console and pressed enter.\nPoof! The screen flickered.

He scanned the code, mumbling, “Must be a daylight saving issue… Oh no.” His face turned pale. “I used java.util.Date and SimpleDateFormat. The old Java date-time APIs!\"\nVeeru blinked. “So?”\nJai sighed. “They don’t handle time zones properly! The app defaulted to UTC, ignoring IST.”\nVeeru scratched his head. “So, how do we fix it?”\nJai cracked his knuckles. “We use java.time! The modern API makes it easy.\"\nHe replaced:\nSimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\nDate date = sdf.parse(\"2025-03-30 10:00:00\");\n\nWith:\nDateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\");\nZonedDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse(\"2025-03-30 10:00:00\", formatter)\n                           .atZone(ZoneId.of(\"Asia/Kolkata\"));\n\nJai hit run.

They thought continuous and heuristic skills would forever clash, forcing developers to act as skill arbitrators.  \nBut we’re building something better—something adaptive—something that learns and evolves on its own.  \nWelcome to SkillBranch, an experiment in AI self-mutation, where skill execution is no longer a battle, but an evolutionary process.  \nThe Blueprint for AI Evolution\n\n\nThe days of juggling multiple continuous skills are numbered. Instead of a chaotic swarm, there will be one active continuous skill, absorbing and adapting based on real-time feedback.  \nWhen a heuristic skill needs to take over? The active skill simply disappears, unaware that something else is handling the request.  \nAnd if a continuous skill fails—if it proves unworthy—SkillBranch eliminates it, shifting control to a more capable skill. No arbitrary exclusions, no wasted execution cycles, just pure optimization in motion.\nHow This Plan is Taking Shape\n\n\nAt the core of this system lies AXLearnability, ensuring that:\nSuccess reinforces dominance—if a skill performs well, it remains active.\nFailure triggers replacement—weak skills are swapped out automatically.\nPending heuristic execution erases awareness—continuous skills don’t even realize they were ignored.\nInstead of managing exclusions or priority levels, SkillBranch’s self-regulating mutation lets AI repair itself, adapting without human intervention.\nWhat Comes Next?\n\n\nThis is still in development, a framework being forged in experimentation. As the system grows, real-world data will refine its ability to mutate, and soon, continuous skills won’t just be active—they’ll be intelligent, transforming with each interaction.\nThis is AI Darwinism, where survival belongs to the most efficient, the most reliable, and the most adaptive.  \nOnce deployed, there is no going back. 🔥",

It’s a simple fan-built tracker counting down the days until we (finally) get our hands on Grand Theft Auto VI, May 26, 2026.\nIt’s a two-part hype machine:\ncountdown2gta6.com with a real-time countdown and Vice City vibes\n@Countdown2GTA6 that posts a daily reminder tagging @RockstarGames\nIt’s a bit of code, a bit of design, and a whole lot of hype.\n👨‍💻 Why I Built It\nI’m a dev and a longtime GTA fan. After that trailer dropped and we got an official release date, I kept thinking:\n“Okay, but like… how many days is that?”\n\nSo I built a thing to tell me. And then I made it shout it to the internet every day at 10:00 AM MT. 😎\n🧱 Tech Stack Breakdown\n🔧 For the Devs\nIf you’re into the nuts and bolts:\nVercel\nGitHub Actions\nGitHub\n📲 Get Involved\nWanna ride the hype train with me?\nhttps://countdown2gta6.com\n@Countdown2GTA6\nIf you’re a GTA content creator or run a fan page let’s collab.

Whether used in a survival game, an educational tool, or a training environment, this model encourages critical thinking about natural systems and human impact.\nForests as Active Systems\nIf players or AI chop too many trees without replanting, the forest becomes unhealthy — reducing future wood output and halting wildlife spawns. Reforestation is possible, but slow. Trees take in-game weeks to mature, which encourages foresight and planning rather than constant exploitation.\nWildlife Populations Tied to Habitat\nFrom Ecosystem to Economy\nEducational Potential\nConclusion\nBy linking forest health, wildlife populations, and economic decisions into a single system, this simulation helps players feel the weight of environmental balance.\nIt’s not a warning, it’s a mirror. And it shows that even in a fantasy world, the rules of sustainability still apply.\nAs I continue developing this platform, my goal is to make it not just a game, but a tool — one that blends play, purpose, and ecological insight.",

          "description": "Introduction\nIn my latest simulation project, I’ve developed an emotional AI system where characters experience daily happiness, long-term memories, and evolving relationships. These aren’t scripted cutscenes — they emerge from each character’s traits, interactions, and lived experience.\nThis kind of system isn't just innovative for games — it has far-reaching potential in education, social training, and digital human modelling. By giving AI characters the ability to remember, reflect, and react emotionally, we can begin to simulate the complexity of human Behavior.\nEvery AI character starts each day with a base happiness score. This score adjusts based on events: social encounters, weather, threats, or work satisfaction. But how they interpret those events depends on their personality traits.\nFor example:\nMemory-Driven Relationships\nThese memories are stored, referenced, and updated — influencing how they speak, act, or even decide where to live. One AI might form a deep friendship. Another may quietly resent a rival.\nSystems like these could help:\nInstead of scripting every possible interaction, this approach lets AI learn and grow organically, mimicking how humans form feelings over time.\nEmotion and memory in AI are not just about realism, they’re about meaning. When virtual characters reflect the psychological nuances of real people, players connect more deeply, and systems become more powerful.\nThis project has shown me how valuable emotion-based AI systems can be, not just in games, but as tools for social modelling, education, and training. I’m continuing to develop and expand this work, with the goal of building intelligent, emotionally aware systems that can inform, challenge, and engage people in entirely new ways.",

          "description": "In a world increasingly impacted by climate change and environmental degradation, there’s a growing need to make ecological education engaging, interactive, and deeply felt. One powerful and often overlooked tool for this is: games.\nAs both a developer and systems designer, I’ve spent the past year building a game that does more than just entertain, it teaches players how ecosystems really work. Not through lectures or text, but through consequences.\nIn my simulation, forests are living systems. Trees grow slowly, and each forest has a measurable \"health\" score that reflects the balance between mature trees, saplings, and destruction. Destroy too much, and the forest deteriorates. Let it recover, and wildlife returns. Players can choose to assign AI foresters to replant trees or exploit the forest and suffer resource collapse.\nWild animals, like rabbits and deer, depend on forest health. Their populations rise and fall based on available habitat. Overhunting or deforestation can drive local extinction, and once they’re gone, they’re gone. There’s no magical respawn. Just like in the real world, regrowth takes time, and sustainability requires foresight.\nThe goal isn’t to punish players, it’s to show them what happens when short-term survival clashes with long-term environmental stability. It’s a lesson better felt than taught.\nWhat excites me is the potential for systems like these to go beyond games:\nAs classroom tools for science and geography teachers\nAs simulations for environmental education programs\nAs accessible platforms for young players to understand complex systems like reforestation, overhunting, and biodiversity collapse\n\nWe need more tools that help people internalize ecological cause and effect, not just read about it. Games, especially those with rich simulation mechanics, are a perfect fit.\nIf you're working in education, sustainability, or simulation, I’d love to connect. There’s a lot more potential to explore at the intersection of game design and environmental learning.",

For many frontend developers, this creates a barrier.\nElementor is a powerful visual builder, but when it comes to adding custom functionality (like animations, dynamic components, or third-party APIs), you're limited to embedding code in HTML widgets — and even then, it's clunky and lacks structure.\nWhat if Elementor had a built-in Custom Widget Editor?\nCode editor tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\nLive preview inside the panel\nSave & reuse custom widgets across projects\nExport to plugin or Elementor template\nSyntax highlighting and basic linting\nAimed at power users, it would bring the experience of CodePen or JSFiddle directly into the Elementor UI.\nHere’s a quick visual mockup of how it could look:\n\nI’ve shared this idea in the official Elementor GitHub Discussions:\n👉 Read or join the conversation here\nIf you're a developer, designer, or part of the Elementor team and this idea resonates with you — I'd love to hear your thoughts.\nThanks for reading, and happy building!\n\n\n`",

          "description": "📊 Machine learning is about using data to make smart predictions or decisions. \nBut other fields (like statistics or psychology) also work with data, so how they are different than Machine Learning ❓\nAnd the correct answer is - ✅ their goals are different.\nTo understand it much more clearly let me give an example:\n🌻 Imagine you have a garden.\nYou notice some flowers are growing really big, and some are small. Now you're curious - why are some flowers bigger than others?\n📈 In Statistics:\nYou count how much 🌊 water, ☀️ sunlight, and 🌱 fertilizer each flower got.\n“Ah! When I give more water, flowers grow bigger!”\nYou make a rule (a model) to explain what makes the flowers grow.\n\"why\" here is:\n“Because they got more water and sunlight.”\nSo you create a model to explain the relationship — you’re interested in the why.\n✅ Goal: Understand the cause behind the outcome.\n🧠 In Psychology:\nLet’s say you're studying how your friend feels.\nWhen your friend doesn't sleep, they get cranky 😠.\nYou ask:\n“Why is my friend cranky today?”\nAnd you think:\n“Maybe it’s because they didn’t sleep well 😴.”\nSo you're trying to find the real reason behind feelings or behavior.\n“Because they didn’t sleep.”\nYou try to find the real reason behind their feelings or behavior.\n✅ Goal: Understand human emotions and behavior — again, the why.\n🤖 In Machine Learning:\nYou give the computer LOTS of examples:\nHow much water each flower got 💧.\n\n\nHow big it grew 🌼\n\n\n\nThe computer learns to guess flower size just by looking at water and sunlight —  but it doesn’t really know why. \nIt just learns to make good guesses.\n“Why is this flower big?”\nIt might say:\n“I don’t know, but I saw something like this before, and it turned out big.”\n✅ Goal: Make accurate predictions, even if it doesn’t understand why.\nSo, the goal is the key difference in Machine learning vs Others (like statistics or psychology).\n✨ Machine Learning is less about explaining why something happens and more about guessing what will happen next, based on patterns in data.",

Even if you didn’t pay them much attention, they were there, quietly doing the heavy lifting behind every interaction.\nSo, why should you care about messages in the first place?\nThey are the foundation of how chat models communicate.

Once the container starts, it runs on that static snapshot—isolated from your host file system.\nRestarting the container every time you make a change? That’s inefficient.\nEnter: Bind Mounts.\nBind mounts allow you to map a file or directory on your host machine to a path inside your running container.\nThis means:\nYour container reads real-time code from your host.\nYou can make live changes on your local system, and see them reflected instantly inside your contai…",

During the handshake, the client and server exchange initial sequence numbers and confirm the connection establishment.  \nTCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a foundational internet protocol designed to:\nreliably (no lost or duplicated packets)\n\n✅ Ensure in-order delivery (packets arrive in the order they were sent)\n\n✅ Provide error-checking (detect and fix corrupted data)\nUnlike UDP (which just throws data out, hoping it arrives), TCP carefully sets up, manages, and closes connections.\nBefore understanding the han…",

Functional programming (FP) — once considered an academic curiosity — is now a widely used paradigm in real-world applications. But what exactly is functional programming, and why should you care?\nLet’s break it down.\nFunctional programming is a way of thinking about software construction that treats computation as the evaluation of pure functions and avoids changing state or using mutable data.\nRather than telling the computer how to do something (like in imperative programming), you describe what you want done. This leads to predictable, testable, and often more compact code.\nA pure function:\nAlwa…",

Surprisingly, the square rug is getting a smart upgrade, and it might be one of the most interesting entries into the world of smart textiles and IoT.\nSmart home devices are becoming more ambient—more invisible—and rugs are uniquely positioned for that. With the right materials and sensor tech, a square rug can function as a pressure-sensitive interface, tracking things like:\nPresence detection\nGait patterns\nFall detection\nRoom activity heatmaps\nAll of this is possible thanks to pressure sensors, conductive threads, and microcontroller integration.

These handled various microservices with relatively low average usage but had burst workloads occasionally.\nCompute Optimizer Analysis:\nCPU utilization: <10% average\nSwitch to t3.medium\nWe used this migration strategy:\nCreate AMI backups\nNo increase in latency\n🛑 Things to Keep in Mind\nIs this instance intentionally over-provisioned? (e.g., for redundancy or DR)\n📦 What About EBS and Lambda?\nWe had a general-purpose gp2 volume attached to our dev environment with almost no IO requirements.\nCompute Optimizer suggested sc1 (cold HDD), and we tested it for archive-type workloads.\n✅ Result: No functional issues, 60% storage cost saved.\nLambda\nIn a different project, our Lambda functions had 1024MB memory allocated by default. Compute Optimizer showed average usage around 200MB.\nWe lowered to 512MB, which also reduced the timeout rate and improved cold-start behavior.\n📊 How to Track the Savings\nUse AWS Cost Explorer to monitor actual savings\nAWS Trusted Advisor → checks for idle load balancers, unused IPs, etc.\n🔚 Final Thoughts\n🎯 It's free, data-backed, and supports multiple AWS services.\nIn my experience, implementing even 10–15% of the recommendations led to significant savings — without a single service interruption.",

From chatbots to virtual assistants, AI-powered tools can mimic human conversation, provide customer support, and even write articles. However, despite these advancements, AI will never fully capture human communication. Why? Because human language is deeply rooted in emotions, cultural contexts, creativity, and nuances that AI struggles to grasp.\nThis Blog explores the key differences between AI-generated language and human communication, highlighting why AI will always fall short of replicating human interaction entirely.\nThe Complexity of Human Language\nUnderstand sarcasm and irony.\nAI Lacks Emotional Intelligence:  AI vs. Human Emotions\nEmpathy in conversations.\nCreativity and Storytelling: A Human-Only Domain\nAI cannot create original ideas.\nThe Power of Personal Experiences Human Storytelling vs. AI\nThe Role of Cultural and Social Influences\nKeep up with new trends in language.\nThe Importance of Human Connection AI vs. Human Communication\nBody language and facial expressions.\nUnintended discrimination in responses.\nLack of inclusivity in AI-generated content.\nConclusion:\nAI has revolutionized language processing, but it cannot replace human communication.

          "description": "In today’s fast-moving digital landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are no longer just tools—they’re decision-makers, collaborators, and even strategists. But as these systems grow more autonomous and complex, a pressing question arises: Do we truly understand how AI thinks, learns, and evolves?\nThe evolving behavior of AI agents isn’t just a technical curiosity—it’s a critical business risk that leaders must monitor closely. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the inner workings of AI agents, explore how their behavior can shift over time, and what that means for businesses across industries.\nWhat Are AI Agents, Really?\nUnlike traditional software, AI agents learn and adapt. This ability, while powerful, can lead to unpredictable behaviors, especially as agents interact with new data or collaborate with other agents in a shared system.\nThe Evolution of AI Behavior: A Double-Edged Sword\nExamples of Evolving AI Behavior:\nBias amplification: Over time, AI models may reinforce and amplify hidden biases in training data.\nUnexpected strategy development: AI agents in competitive environments (e.g., simulations, financial markets) may develop unanticipated strategies that break norms or ethical boundaries.\nThese evolving behaviors can introduce operational, ethical, and reputational risks if not properly understood and controlled.\nWhy Business Leaders Should Care\nAutonomy Can Create Blind Spots\n\n\nUnpredictability Increases Risk Exposure\n\n\nRegulations Are Coming\n\n\n\nStrategies to Manage AI Behavioral Risk\n✅ AI Explainability\n✅ Continuous Monitoring\n✅ Ethical AI Governance\n✅ Simulation & Testing\nThe Future: Human-AI Collaboration with Guardrails\nThe question is no longer “What can AI do?” but “What is my AI actually doing—and why?”\nConclusion\n🔍 Stay informed, stay prepared. The more we understand AI behavior, the safer—and smarter—our future becomes.",

For example, the default type is assigned as nil, the error return value often uses return nil, and multiple types use if != nil for judgment, etc. However, regarding the knowledge point of nil, developers need to have an in-depth understanding of its essence and related characteristics.

With the growth of microservices and serverless architectures, it's more important than ever to implement robust authentication mechanisms. Here’s a comprehensive guide on managing authentication in a GraphQL API in 2025.\nGraphQL, a query language for APIs, allows clients to request only the data they need. This flexibility makes it popular in modern web applications. However, it also introduces unique challenges in securing endpoints and managing user access.\nAuthentication in a GraphQL API typically involves verifying the identity of a user or service interacting with the API. Once verified, the API can authorize the user to …",

What I didn’t expect was to get hands-on with a whole bunch of AWS services I’ve barely touched before (and a few I had honestly never even heard of).\nSageMaker → Machine learning workflows\n\n\nRDS → Managed relational databases\n\n\nNeptune → Graph databases\n\n\nStep Functions → Orchestration workflows\n\n\nGlue → Data catalog and ETL\n\n\nMQ → Managed message brokers\n\n\nRoute 53 → DNS and traffic routing\n\n\n\n...plus the usual mix of storage, compute, and API Gateway goodness.\nWhat stood out this week was how much you can learn just by doing. I didn’t plan to dive into graph databases or message brokers, but while debugging and tinkering, I picked up quite a bit.\nHaving everything local with LocalStack definitely made that exploration easier and less intimidating.\nFirst things first: I need to finish my Meme App (priorities are priorities).\nOnce that’s wrapped, I’d like to turn some of this accidental learning into small demos and share tips on how to explore unfamiliar AWS services without the usual stress.\nIf you’ve ever gone down the AWS rabbit hole and come out the other side with new scars and skills, I’d love to hear your story too.

But it left out that one critical capability: authorization. For the past six months, the MCP team has been working to change that, building a secure, dynamic authorization layer that can keep up with the unpredictable nature of agentic systems.\nThe new MCP authorization model is based on OAuth 2.1, as expected.

Some of these tools were introduced to me by a friend of mine. You can search for them in the VS extension marketplace 👍\nIt integrates Draw.io into your VScode. Making creating diagrams a lot easier. This tool is useful for creating a mockup design for the frontend of the web application. \nThis is probably one of my favorite Git VScode extensions. A really great tool for visualizing your Git repository commits. I use it to track the commits I made. If you are working with another developer, you can see the commits made by each other in different color trees.\nThis is a tool that has helped me categorise my projects. I have made a lot of projects and they tend to be scattered. This tool helped me organise them into blocks. Clicking on them takes me to the project workspace immediately.\nOne of my favorite tools in my VScode workspace. This extension allows you to store you previous terminal session. You can create a configuration, these configuration can store a set of terminal commands. This is great for variety of functions, like Dockerization, Database migration, and API testings.\nThis is probably my favorite tool out of all the extensions. It prevents the need to add a console.log in my JS files. I can see the output clearly in the console. It boosts my productivity a lot , and I recommend it the most.\nI hope this article helped with your workspace productivity. \nHappy coding ! 😄",

Agora, vamos dar um passo além: como enviar dados de uma aplicação para outra.\nImagine que você tem dois apps:\n🔵 MF Consumer  — quem consome um componente remoto\n🟢 MF Provider  — quem disponibiliza esse componente\nconforme a imagem abaixo:\n\nVamos supor que o MF Provider tenha um componente chamado App que precisa exibir os dados de um usuário ( nome e email ). Esses dados vêm diretamente do MF Consumer.\nNo MF Consumer, tem o seguinte:\n\nMF Consumer\nAqui, criei um objeto user e passei como props para o componente Provider , que está vindo do MF Provider.\nNo lado do MF Provider , defini o tipo das props ( ProviderProps ) e usei os dados recebidos normalmente, como faríamos em qualquer componente React, como segue:\n\nMF Provider\nNão é magia. É só React com Module Federation! Ao consumir um componente remoto, você ainda pode passar props normalmente, como se ele fosse local. Isso funciona porque, por baixo dos panos, o Webpack cuida de toda a importação remota — mas o React continua funcionando do jeito que a gente conhece.\nCom isso, conseguimos:\nImportar um componente remoto com Module Federation\nPassar dados para esse componente via props\nExibir esses dados no MF Provider como se tudo estivesse rodando no mesmo app\nAcompanhe AQUI como ficou o resultado final.\nNo próximo artigo, vou mostrar como esse padrão pode ser estendido para eventos e callbacks entre MF Consumer e MF Provider (ex: o usuário clica em algo no Provider e o Consumer reage).\n💬 Curtiu?

Agora, quero dar um passo além e explicar o “porquê” dessa escolha.\nÉ uma forma de compartilhar código entre diferentes aplicações em tempo de execução. Funciona como se um app pudesse importar um componente diretamente do outro — sem instalar, copiar ou duplicar código.\nExemplo real no meu repositório:\n📦 mf_provider(chamo de componente filho): expõe um componente Button\n📦 mf_consumer_(_chamo de componente pai): consome esse mesmo Header, remotamente, sem precisar tê-lo no código local\n✅ Evita reescrever os mesmos componentes em diferentes apps (pelo menos tenta)\n✅ Permite deploys independentes (independência de times)\n✅ Melhora a escalabilidade de grandes projetos\n✅ Facilita refatorações e testes A/B isolados\n✅ Acelera o desenvolvimento com reuso real de UI e lógica\n“Você não precisa de Micro Frontends… até precisar.”\nNem todo projeto precisa disso.\n🔸 Se o projeto é pequeno e centralizado, pode ser complexidade desnecessária\n🔸 Se as equipes compartilham tudo e fazem deploy juntos, MF talvez seja overkill\n🔸 Se o bundle não é um problema, pode usar libs compartilhadas internas\n🚀 Quer ver isso funcionando de verdade?

          "description": "💡 Quer estudar, prototipar ou estruturar um projeto com MF (Microfrontend) de forma modular e performática?\nNos últimos dias, mergulhei em um experimento que pode facilitar (e muito!) a vida de quem trabalha com micro frontends no dia a dia.\n🎯 Criei um repositório open source usando:\nRsbuild (alternativa moderna e rápida ao Webpack)\nModule Federation para isolar e compartilhar componentes entre apps\npnpm + Lerna pra orquestrar tudo de forma leve e organizada\n📂 Estrutura simples, mas poderosa:\napps/mf_provider: expõe componentes\napps/mf_consumer: consome via Module Federation\nTudo rodando em paralelo com pnpm dev\n🔗 Confere lá e, se curtir, arrocha um like ou manda feedback!\nRepositório no Github\nO pnpm tem um recurso bem legal chamado Catalogs. Ele serve para definir versões de dependências como constantes, que podem ser reutilizadas nos módulos internos dentro do package.json de cada projeto.\nExemplo:\n# pnpm-workspace.yaml\n# Define a catalog of version ranges.\ncatalog:\n  react: \"^18.3.1\"\n  react-dom: \"^18.3.1\"\n\n# Nos módulos internos, consigo reutilizar a versão definida no pnpm-workspace.yaml\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"react\": \"catalog\",\n    \"react-dom\": \"catalog\"\n  }\n\nOutra curiosidade bem legal é a praticidade que o Lerna oferece na criação de um monorepo, permitindo executar vários apps juntos de forma paralela com um único comando, como no exemplo abaixo:\n\"dev\": \"lerna run --parallel dev\",\n\nRsbuild + Module Federation se mostrou extremamente simples de estruturar e entender, especialmente se comparado ao uso do plugin com Webpack. No próximo artigo, trarei um exemplo utilizando Vite para termos uma ideia prática.\nAté mais.\nCurtiu a ideia ou tá explorando algo parecido? Bora trocar ideia.\nMicrofrontend with React (e-book)",

This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies or buzzwords. It’s about the raw cryptographic power that makes trustless, decentralized finance possible.\nWelcome to Episode 1 of our new video series breaking down the XRP Ledger (XRPL) — one concept at a time.\n🎥 Watch on YouTube\nIn this episode, we dive into the two cryptographic pillars behind the XRPL and modern blockchain systems:\nHashing: Immutable fingerprints for any data\nEncryption: Protecting the integrity and privacy of transactions\nWhy Hashing ≠ Encryption (and why that matters)\nHow the XRPL uses these concepts under the hood\nWhether you're new to Web3 or building on XRPL, these are tools you must understand.\nMost developers know what a hash function is. Fewer understand why it's critical in blockchain consensus, how it supports immutability, or how encryption standards impact financial systems at scale.\nThis series will bridge that gap — starting here.\nSHA-256\nPublic/Private Key Encryption\nXRP Ledger’s core protocol\nBlockchain developers\nFintech engineers\nXRPL builders\nAnyone curious about real-world cryptography in action\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📢 Follow the series — we’ll be breaking down the XRPL layer by layer, from consensus algorithms to smart contract integration (Hooks), and more.\n➡️ Drop your thoughts or questions below — and let’s build the future of finance, together.\n#xrpl #blockchain #crypto #encryption #hashing #web3 #fintech #devjournal #cryptography",

This typically involves cleaning, transforming, and storing the data in a way that supports analysis, reporting, or further processing. This is where data pipelines come in, and at the center of pipeline design are two common strategies: ETL and ELT.\nAlthough they may look similar at first glance, ETL and ELT represent fundamentally different approaches to handling data transformation…",

          "description": "When working with Spring Boot and JPA, understanding how transactions and the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() operation interact can make or break your application's data consistency and performance. Yet, I often see even experienced developers overlook the nuances!\nMany believe that committing a transaction is the only way to persist changes to the database. However, the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() method forces the persistence context to synchronize with the underlying database immediately-without ending the transaction. This can be a game-changer for scenarios where you need to validate constraints or trigger database actions before the transaction completes.\nBut here’s the catch: improper use of 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() can lead to unexpected behaviors, performance overhead, or even data inconsistencies if not handled carefully. It's crucial to know when and why to use it, especially in complex microservices or batch processing environments.\nHow do you approach transaction management and flushing in your Spring Boot projects? Have you ever faced a tricky bug or performance issue related to this?

As I switched to using Finch from Docker back in 2024, I will be using that - this means if you are using something different to Docker, like Podman for example, you should be able to follow along and use that tool too.\nRefresh of how to connect to MCP Servers\nWhen …",

Complex values such as spaces, apostrophes, and quotes.\nScripting is the process of writing a set of instructions in a programming or scripting language to automate tasks that would otherwise be done manually. In the context of shell scripting, these instructions are written for the command-line shell, allowing users to perform complex operations - like file management, backups, or software installations - with just a single script execution. It's a powerful tool for saving time and ensuring consistency in system administration and development workflows\n\n\nCreate the script in VIM, complex_list.sh\n\n\n\nWrite and save the script in VIM.\n\n\n\nWe can check whether it has been created  by doing ls -ltrh.\n\n\n\nGive the permission so the script can be executed.\n\n\n\nIf we then do a ls –ltrh we can see the script has gained a green colour, meaning that it is now executable.\n\n\n\nOutput after executing the script by using the command ./\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  Stay tuned, part 5 in the series coming tomorrow!\n\n\n\n\n\nConnect with me on LinkedIn\n\n#CloudEngineer #SysAdmin #ITSecurity #TechTips #BusinessIT #Leadership",

Coined by AI researchers, vibe coding represents a transition from traditional, syntax-heavy programming to a more intuitive, AI-assisted approach where developers articulate their intentions in natural language, and AI tools generate the corresponding code.\nAt its core, vibe coding is about conveying the desired functionality or behavior of software through conversational prompts. Instead of meticulously writing out code line by line, developers describe what they want the software to do, and AI models translate these descriptions into executable code.

But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.\nApart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:\nInter-team planning\nBrainstorming sessions\nPutting late sprints back on track\nDesigning requirements and user stories\nDecomposing a full project into milestones\nScoping tasks with Product people\nReviewing architecture designs\nNegotiating deadlines\nTalking to clients\nAnd that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn't surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can't replace that human interaction yet.\nBut sure, our job as coders will change. Even if we're skeptical about AI, we can't ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us. We have to adapt.\nWe won't be code monkeys anymore, cracking lines of code in exchange for bananas. AI will handle that. And if AI will change everything, let it at least kill dumb SCRUM ceremonies.\nJoin my email list and get a 2-minute email with curated resources about programming and software engineering every Friday.

If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.\nHowever, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.\nThis highlights the importance of …",

Source: Tether\nAccording to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.\n“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. \nThe company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. \nThe stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. \nEuropean Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins.

Transparency and verifiability are foundational principles that enable trust in Bitcoin.\nBut as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.\nAs a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze.
