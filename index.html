                              <span>Key takeaways:

BTC hit $97,900 due to soaring institutional investor demand, but futures pricing shows traders aren&#x27;t confident in a sustained rally.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows.

BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs).

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23, roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token.  
“I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News.

                              <span>Ethereum’s relative dominance among layer-1 (L1) blockchain networks has declined, resulting in an “open race” to become the leading Web3 platform, according to Alex Svanevik, CEO of data service Nansen.
“If you’d asked me 3–4 years ago whether Ethereum would dominate crypto, I’d have said yes,” Svanevik said during a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event. “But now, it’s clear that’s not what’s happening.”
Ethereum is still the most popular L1 network. According to data from DefiLlama, its roughly $52 billion in total value locked (TVL) represents 51% of cryptocurrency residing on blockchain networks.
However, Ethereum’s dominance has diminished sharply since 2021, when the L1 controlled as much as 96% of aggregate TVL, the data shows.

According to Artem Shaginyan, founder and head of strategy of Web3 payment company Lunu Pay, the Cannes municipal government is aiming for a 90% adoption rate among local merchants. The executive also told Cointelegraph:
&quot;This is a big signal. When a city like Cannes, known globally for culture and commerce, starts integrating crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 payments aren’t just a niche thing anymore. It’s about proving that crypto can work in everyday settings, not just online or in theory.&quot;

According to an April 29 Deadline report, McKenzie wrote, directed, and produced the documentary Everyone Is Lying To You For Money, set to premiere at SXSW London in June. The film features footage from 2022 of former FTX CEO Sam “SBF” Bankman-Fried and former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky before their respective companies folded. 
“Why is the false story of crypto still spreading?” said McKenzie, according to Deadline. “That’s the question I set out to answer with this film.”

Analyst predicts a low VIX (

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score below 18 implied a “risk-on” environment, favoring assets like Bitcoin. 
Peterson’s model, which had a 95% tracking accuracy, predicted a $135,000 target within the next 100 days if the VIX remains low. This aligns with Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, as a low VIX reduces uncertainty, encouraging investment in ri…</span>

The nodes mostly comprise human users who provide data in exchange for rewards via the network’s mobile application, COIN. “The vast majority of our 10 million nodes are mobile users, but some are IoT devices like smart speakers,” Levin told Cointelegraph. 
Approximately 80% of XYO’s users are non-crypto natives who are participating in Web3 for the first time, he added.
They include truckers, rideshare drivers, delivery people, and nurses among others, Levin said, adding that “95% convert after onboarding through the COIN app.”

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an over two-month high of $97,300 last seen at the end of February, before the “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in the US, bolstering analyst predictions for a rally driven by “structural” institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows into the world’s first cryptocurrency.
Risk appetite continued rising among crypto investors, as Chinese state-linked news outlets indicated that the Trump administration has quietly contacted Beijing to discuss tariff reductions.

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

On Jan. 11, 2024, it transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF following a landmark victory against the SEC. This marked a pivotal moment with the SEC’s view that ETFs can offer lower expense ratios and enhanced tax efficiency compared to traditional funds.

Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.
Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure. 
It enables developers and engineers to build a censorship-resistant and accessible open-data web to champion the cause of free speech. Open-source technology creates a paradigmatic shift in a fair and inclusive internet where centralized web companie…</span>

                              <span>As Ether’s price has struggled in the first quarter of 2025, a US-based investment adviser firm, Two Prime, has dropped support for ETH and adopted a Bitcoin-only strategy.
After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.
The firm’s shift to a Bitcoin-only approach comes as ETH has lost 45% of its value year-to-date, with some optimists speculating that ETH is potentially close to the bottom and reversing its negative trend soon.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP’s strongest spot premium phase suggests real buying demand, not just speculative futures trading. 

The number of XRP addresses holding ≥10,000 tokens has steadily climbed, even during recent price pullbacks. 

A falling wedge pattern points to a possible breakout toward $3 to $3.78, with up to 70% upside if confirmed.

XRP (XRP) is experiencing its strongest sustained phase of spot premium in history, a period where the spot market has been consistently trading at stronger levels compared to perpetual futures.
XRP’s 350% rally is backed by real demand  
Since 2020, most major XRP price peaks happened when the perpetual futures market was leading, noted market analyst Dom in his May 2 post on X.

Appetite for global risk assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) may take another hit, with analysts from Apollo Global Management predicting a recession by the summer.
“Apollo predicting Summer Recession: Sharpest decline in earnings outlook since 2020,” cross-asset analyst Samantha LaDuc wrote in an April 26 X post.
The progress on the tariff negotiations may be the most significant factor impacting a potential recession and Bitcoin’s price trajectory, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.

According to a May 2 Financial Times report, the ban on borrowing to fund crypto purchases is one of the upcoming crypto rules by the FCA. David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, told the FT that “crypto is an area of potential growth for the UK, but it has to be done right.” He added:
“To do that we have to provide an appropriate level of protection.”
Geale denied claims that the FCA is hostile to the crypto industry. Instead, he explained that he views the industry as offering high-risk investments with less consumer protection. “We are open for business,“ he said.

Asked about his tariff program, the president remarked, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.’”
But the toy stores where those dolls are sold might have something to say about it. 
Earlier in the week, Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota joined a growing number of American small businesses suing the president over his emergency tariff plan.
Throughout April, a groundswell of lawsuits led by 13 states further challenged Trump’s ambitious tariff program. Their success or failure rests on hundreds of years of judicial policy an…</span>

If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.
However, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.

                              <span>Key points:

Bitcoin long-term holders are about to hit a level of unrealized profit, which has traditionally caused them to sell.

That level coincides with the return to a six-figure BTC price.

Order book data suggests that bulls may not succeed in keeping the upside going.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “notable increase” in selling from its older investors if price rises further, warns onchain analytics firm Glassnode.
In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” researchers calculated that long-term holders (LTHs) are sitting on almost 350% unrealized profits.

Lately, stablecoins are everywhere — this time around, headed by “traditional” financial institutions. Bank of America and Standard Chartered are considering launching their own stablecoin, joining JPMorgan, which launched its stablecoin, JPM Coin — rebranded as Kinexys Digital Payments — to facilitate transactions with their institutional clients on their blockchain platform, Kinexys (formerly Onyx). 
Mastercard plans to bring stablecoins to the mainstream, joining Bleap Finance, a crypto startup. The aim is to enable stablecoins to be spent directly onchain — without conversions or intermediaries — seamlessly integrating blockchain assets with Mastercard’s global payment rails.

When the lines blur between man and machine, you’re looking at artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition.
AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality.

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin (BTC) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs. However, that’s since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post.
“Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a gamble mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach,” he said.
“This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains,” Quinlivan added.

                              <span>The US Securities and Exchange Commission has filed to drop another of its crypto lawsuits, this time its unregistered securities sales case against crypto influencer and YouTuber Ian Balina. 
The SEC said in a May 1 joint stipulation with Balina to an Austin federal court that it “believes the dismissal of this case is appropriate,” citing the work of the agency’s Crypto Task Force.
The agency didn’t give a reason for wanting to dismiss its case, but said its decision “does not necessarily reflect the Commission’s position on any other case.”
Balina told Cointelegraph in March that the SEC had informed him it would recommend the court dismiss the case and claimed the agency’s actions were based on a shift in the agency’s priorities.
“Obviously, the new administration is pro-crypto,” Balin…</span>

                              <span>Decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform Sky has pitched a proposal to finalize its upgrade from Maker by replacing its governance token and enabling staking.
The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token.
If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled.
Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.”

                              <span>US crypto exchange Kraken has detailed a North Korean hacker’s attempt to infiltrate the organization by applying for a job interview.
“What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role quickly turned into an intelligence-gathering operation,” the company wrote in a May 1 blog post.
Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview.
Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used.

Kraken said in a May 1 report that its NinjaTrader acquisition would give its US customers access to the traditional derivatives market, aligning with its plans to expand its offerings and be the go-to platform for all types of trading.
NinjaTrader is a registered Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Last month, it rolled out trading for over 11,000 stocks and exchange-traded funds to certain US clients.
The deal, which Kraken dubbed the largest ever between a crypto and traditional finance firm, allows NinjaTrader to expand to the UK, continental Europe and Australian market…</span>

Did you know the last commercial computer using 9-bit bytes was shut down only 30 years ago? That was the PDP-10—still running when C was dominant, C++ was just emerging (but not yet standardized), Java hadn’t launched (just one year before its release), and Python was still in development (two years before version 1.0).
That kind of diversity hasn’t gone away—it’s just shifted. Today:
There are 35+ active CPU architecture families: x86/64, Arm, MIPS, RISC-V, Xtensa, TriCore, SPARC, PIC, AVR, and many more

Some use unusual instruction widths (e.g., 13-bit for Padauk’s $0.03 MCU)

Not all CPUs support floating-point—or even 8-bit operations



And beyond the hardware:

Let&#x27;s be honest: AI is everywhere these days. From the apps on our phones to the tools we use at work, artificial intelligence is quietly (and sometimes not-so-quietly) reshaping how we get things done. But for many of us, the real magic happens when AI becomes a true partner, helping us brainstorm, automate the boring stuff, and even spark a little creativity when we need it most.
If you&#x27;ve ever wished you could have a super-smart assistant right in your terminal, or wondered how to use AI in ways that are actually practical (and not just hype), you&#x27;re in the right place.

                              <span>Creating your own cryptocurrency sounds expensive—but what if you could launch one without spending a single cent? Thanks to open-source tools, free resources, and a bit of creativity, it’s entirely possible to build a secure, functional crypto token or coin on a budget of exactly $0.
In this article, I’ll walk you through how to do just that—without sacrificing quality, security, or credibility.
If you&#x27;re building a cryptocurrency on a budget, the Ethereum blockchain is a great starting point. More specifically, the ERC-20 token standard lets you launch a new token by simply writing and deploying a smart contract.
You don’t need to build your own blockchain, manage nodes, or run any servers. Instead, you leverage the security and reliability of Ethereum’s existing infrastructure.

SQL. As you might have already heard, SQL (STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE) is the language used to interact with structured relational database engines eg PostgreSQL or MySQL. The interaction with database  using SQL may involve one or all of the following activities:
Retrieving records from database.-&gt; SELECT.
Adding new records to the database. -&gt; INSERT.

                              <span>Hi there, I wanted to make this post to recommend some tools that helped me personally as a React Developer over the past 3 years. 
LinkedIn 
This article will only cover VS code extensions that helped me during development. Some of these tools were introduced to me by a friend of mine. You can search for them in the VS extension marketplace 👍
It integrates Draw.io into your VScode. Making creating diagrams a lot easier. This tool is useful for creating a mockup design for the frontend of the web application. 
This is probably one of my favorite Git VScode extensions. A really great tool for visualizing your Git repository commits. I use it to track the commits I made. If you are working with another developer, you can see the commits made by each other in different color trees.
This is a tool that has helped me categorise my projects. I have made a lot of projects and they tend to be scattered. This tool helped me organise them into blocks. Clicking on them takes me to the project workspace immediately.
One of my favorite tools in my VScode workspace. This extension allows you to store you previous terminal session. You can create a configuration, these configuration can store a set of terminal commands. This is great for variety of functions, like Dockerization, Database migration, and API testings.
This is probably my favorite tool out of all the extensions. It prevents the need to add a console.log in my JS files. I can see the output clearly in the console. It boosts my productivity a lot , and I recommend it the most.
I hope this article helped with your workspace productivity. 
Happy coding ! 😄</span>

Permission Testing Toolkit is a CLI utility built with TypeScript that allows teams to validate, simulate, and test their fine-grained access control logic using Permit.io.
✅ It supports both manual test cases via JSON and dynamic test generation using your live Permit.io schema.

✅ It’s perfect for CI pipelines or security-conscious teams that want to &quot;test their policies before they break production.&quot;

✅ Oh — and it looks nice in your terminal too. 🎨
You write the rules. This CLI makes sure they&#x27;re followed.

                              <span>Let’s be honest—JavaScript has been misunderstood for too long. Too many people assume it’s complicated, messy, or only for “real” programmers. But that’s far from the truth.
The reality is: JavaScript is not that hard.
In fact, once you understand its core principles, it’s one of the most intuitive, flexible, and powerful languages you can learn. It powers nearly everything you see on the modern web. And with the right guide, learning JavaScript can not only be simple—it can be fun.
That’s exactly why I wrote the ebook JavaScript is Not That Hard—to prove that anyone can learn JavaScript, even if they’ve never written a single line of code before.
Let’s break this down:
The Syntax is Human-Friendly
if, else, and function—and they just make sense.

                              <span>Na parte 1 desta série, vimos como o Module Federation permite compartilhar componentes entre diferentes aplicações sem precisar instalar pacotes ou duplicar código. Agora, vamos dar um passo além: como enviar dados de uma aplicação para outra.
Imagine que você tem dois apps:
🔵 MF Consumer  — quem consome um componente remoto
🟢 MF Provider  — quem disponibiliza esse componente
conforme a imagem abaixo:

Vamos supor que o MF Provider tenha um componente chamado App que precisa exibir os dados de um usuário ( nome e email ). Esses dados vêm diretamente do MF Consumer.
No MF Consumer, tem o seguinte:

MF Consumer
Aqui, criei um objeto user e passei como props para o componente Provider , que está vindo do MF Provider.
No lado do MF Provider , defini o tipo das props ( ProviderProps ) e usei os dados recebidos normalmente, como faríamos em qualquer componente React, como segue:

MF Provider
Não é magia. É só React com Module Federation! Ao consumir um componente remoto, você ainda pode passar props normalmente, como se ele fosse local. Isso funciona porque, por baixo dos panos, o Webpack cuida de toda a importação remota — mas o React continua funcionando do jeito que a gente conhece.
Com isso, conseguimos:
Importar um componente remoto com Module Federation
Passar dados para esse componente via props
Exibir esses dados no MF Provider como se tudo estivesse rodando no mesmo app
Acompanhe AQUI como ficou o resultado final.
No próximo artigo, vou mostrar como esse padrão pode ser estendido para eventos e callbacks entre MF Consumer e MF Provider (ex: o usuário clica em algo no Provider e o Consumer reage).

With a simple .yaml file, this nifty tool is capable of providing a containerized workbench with PHP, a MariaDB/PostreSQL database, and Mailpit. It&#x27;s perfect for anything from WordPress to the most complex Symfony app. However, out of the box it&#x27;s not tailored to be used alongside Node. Granted, it does come bundled with Node pre-installed, but if you want to use your PHP backend with a TypeScript frontend, it requires a tiny bit of configuration. This is what this article is about. It is inspired by Andy Blum&#x27;s blog post over at Lullabot. My approach is similar but a bit simpler.

                              <span>No meu artigo anterior, mostrei como montei um projeto com Micro Frontends usando Rsbuild, Module Federation, pnpm e Lerna , tudo rodando num monorepo. Agora, quero dar um passo além e explicar o “porquê” dessa escolha.
É uma forma de compartilhar código entre diferentes aplicações em tempo de execução. Funciona como se um app pudesse importar um componente diretamente do outro — sem instalar, copiar ou duplicar código.
Exemplo real no meu repositório:
📦 mf_provider(chamo de componente filho): expõe um componente Button
📦 mf_consumer_(_chamo de componente pai): consome esse mesmo Header, remotamente, sem precisar tê-lo no código local
✅ Evita reescrever os mesmos componentes em diferentes apps (pelo menos tenta)
✅ Permite deploys independentes (independência de times)
✅ Melhora a escalabilidade de grandes projetos
✅ Facilita refatorações e testes A/B isolados
✅ Acelera o desenvolvimento com reuso real de UI e lógica
“Você não precisa de Micro Frontends… até precisar.”
Nem todo projeto precisa disso.
🔸 Se o projeto é pequeno e centralizado, pode ser complexidade desnecessária
🔸 Se as equipes compartilham tudo e fazem deploy juntos, MF talvez seja overkill
🔸 Se o bundle não é um problema, pode usar libs compartilhadas internas

There are clear wins: faster prototyping, more exploratory design conversations before touching code, and almost no actual coding (which is a huge relief, I&#x27;m more of an organize-ideas person, not a coder).
I followed the tools&#x27; lead intentionally, curious to see what they had to offer. But in doing so, I slipped back into early-career patterns, prioritizing feature work and not handling code smells up front. I lost my Monday-ness.
I&#x27;m a code whisperer. A wild west code wrangler. The one who could reshape entire systems by refactoring in their sleep.
In this post, I want to return to the process that made that kind of work possible. The one that helped me grow fro…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s me. I want to learn back end. If you do too, maybe I can help you out.
Lets back up a little bit. I am a front end web developer, and I have noticed a flaw in my peers. It is not always present, but it is certainly prolific. For a job that is existentially deep learning, there is very little focus on how we learn. As a college educator this has always stuck out to me. We know we want to learn backend. But how do we learn back end? That&#x27;s what I want to help you with. 
In my humble opinion our job isn&#x27;t necessarily to write code. Our job is to provide value to others by solving problems. Code just happens to be the most effective tool for that. I find it&#x27;s helpful to approach the the question of how do we learn backend like any other problem. Let me share one of the most valuable tools…</span>

                              <span>API versioning via headers is a powerful way to evolve your API without breaking existing clients. 
Here&#x27;s a deep dive into what it is, why you&#x27;d use it, and a step-by-step guide to implementing it in Express.
1.Separation of Concerns
Versioning in headers keeps your URL space clean - clients still call /users instead of /v1/users or /v2/users.
2.Content Negotiation
HTTP was designed around content negotiation. You can leverage the Accept header or a custom header (e.g. X-API-Version) to tell your server which variant of the response to emit.
3.Granular Control
You can version on a per-resource or even per-field basis depending on header values.

                              <span>💡 Quer estudar, prototipar ou estruturar um projeto com MF (Microfrontend) de forma modular e performática?
Nos últimos dias, mergulhei em um experimento que pode facilitar (e muito!) a vida de quem trabalha com micro frontends no dia a dia.
🎯 Criei um repositório open source usando:
Rsbuild (alternativa moderna e rápida ao Webpack)
Module Federation para isolar e compartilhar componentes entre apps
pnpm + Lerna pra orquestrar tudo de forma leve e organizada
📂 Estrutura simples, mas poderosa:
apps/mf_provider: expõe componentes
apps/mf_consumer: consome via Module Federation
Tudo rodando em paralelo com pnpm dev
🔗 Confere lá e, se curtir, arrocha um like ou manda feedback!
Repositório no Github
O pnpm tem um recurso bem legal chamado Catalogs. Ele serve para definir versões de dependências como constantes, que podem ser reutilizadas nos módulos internos dentro do package.json de cada projeto.
Exemplo:
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
# Define a catalog of version ranges.
catalog:
  react: &quot;^18.3.1&quot;
  react-dom: &quot;^18.3.1&quot;

# Nos módulos internos, consigo reutilizar a versão definida no pnpm-workspace.yaml
  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {
    &quot;react&quot;: &quot;catalog&quot;,
    &quot;react-dom&quot;: &quot;catalog&quot;
  }

Outra curiosidade bem legal é a praticidade que o Lerna oferece na criação de um monorepo, permitindo executar vários apps juntos de forma paralela com um único comando, como no exemplo abaixo:
&quot;dev&quot;: &quot;lerna run --parallel dev&quot;,

Rsbuild + Module Federation se mostrou extremamente simples de estruturar e entender, especialmente se comparado ao uso do plugin com Webpack. No próximo artigo, trarei um exemplo utilizando Vite para termos uma ideia prática.
Até mais.

  Historical Context


The Gamepad API represents a significant leap in web technology, providing developers with the ability to access gamepad inputs natively within a web browser. Before this API, developers often relied on browser support for other technologies, such as Flash or native applications, to create engaging gaming experiences on the web. The introduction of the Gamepad API in the late 2010s marked a paradigm shift; it allowed developers to create immersive gaming experiences that can fully leverage console-style gamepad controls within HTML5 applications.
The specification for the Gamepad API was drafted in the W3C Gamepad Community Group and has seen constant evolution since its inception. As of late…</span>

Data lakes and data warehouses each brought strengths and limitations to the way organizations manage analytics. Lakes offered flexibility and scale, but lacked consistency and performance. Warehouses delivered speed and structure, but often at the cost of rigidity and duplication. The data lakehouse aims to unify the best of both worlds.

In this blog post, i will walk you through the proces of installing and customizing an Apache web server on linux system (Ubuntu). this project has helped me understand the practical steps of web server setup and give me hands on experience with customizing a live webpage.
step1: Chosing the Web Server


For this project, i decided to chose Apache due to its long-standing popularity, extensive documentation and ease of usage.
step2: Installing Apache


First of all, i had to update my package list to make sure the latest software version is available.
sudo apt update

Next, i installed Apache with the command
sudo apt install Apache2

step3: verifying the installation


To verify that Apache is runing, i use the command 
sudo systemctl status apache2

In the growing creator economy, YouTube channels pump out tons of videos every week. and Creators need a simple dashboard that answers the following questions:
How has my channel grown over time?
What is the best day and time to post a video?
What are the most engaging videos in my channel?
To tackle this, I built an end-to-end data pipeline that automatically pulls, processes, and visualizes YouTube data.
In this article goes over the steps I took to archieve this.
Instead of using Docker,I installed everything natively because it gave me more control, better performance tuning, and more flexibility compared to containerized environments.

This post delivers a deep-dive into the fee structure powering Fragment Telegram—a decentralized messaging platform built on blockchain technology. We discuss the background, core fee components like transaction fees, service fees, and conversion fees, and explain the economic impacts these fees bring to user adoption, market competition, and revenue stability. Alongside a technical yet accessible analysis, we explore use cases, challenges, and the future of dynamic pricing models and regulatory compliance. This comprehensive guide is enhanced with tables, bullet lists, and authoritative links to provide both human readers and search engine crawlers with valuable insights.

As data systems grow more complex, understanding where your data came from, how it has changed, and who is responsible for it becomes just as critical as the data itself. It’s not enough to know that a dataset exists—you need to know how it was created, whether it’s trustworthy, and how it fits into the broader system.
In this post, we’ll break down three interconnected concepts—metadata, data lineage, and governance—and explore why they’re essential to building transparent, …</span>

Behind every useful dashboard or analytics report lies a well-structured data model. Data modeling is the practice of shaping data into organized structures that are easy to query, analyze, and maintain. While it may sound abstract, modeling directly impacts how quickly and accurately data consumers can extract value from the information stored in your systems.
In this post, we’ll look at the foundations of data modeling, the difference between OLTP and OLAP systems, and comm…</span>

Let’s upgrade that.
If you&#x27;re working on API testing, test metrics, or even CI/CD pipelines — you can automate beautiful chart-based reports and export them as PDFs. 
Stakeholders/ TL love visuals. 
Devs love clarity. You can have both.

In this blog, I’ll show you how to:
Generate charts (bar, pie, line) using Chart.js or QuickChart

Export those charts (and test data) to PDFs using Puppeteer, jsPDF, or PDFKit

Use them in API testing, test coverage reports, and performance metrics

                              <span>🧠 XRPL EP.1 — Hashing &amp; Encryption: Foundations of the Ledger


The fintech revolution is coming, and at its core lies one of the most underrated innovations of our time — the blockchain ledger. This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies or buzzwords. It’s about the raw cryptographic power that makes trustless, decentralized finance possible.
Welcome to Episode 1 of our new video series breaking down the XRP Ledger (XRPL) — one concept at a time.
🎥 Watch on YouTube
In this episode, we dive into the two cryptographic pillars behind the XRPL and modern blockchain systems:
Hashing: Immutable fingerprints for any data
Encryption: Protecting the integrity and privacy of transactions
Why Hashing ≠ Encryption (and why that matters)
How the XRPL uses these concepts under the hood
Whether you&#x27;re new to Web3 or building on XRPL, these are tools you must understand.
Most developers know what a hash function is. Fewer understand why it&#x27;s critical in blockchain consensus, how it supports immutability, or how encryption standards impact financial systems at scale.
This series will bridge that gap — starting here.
SHA-256
Public/Private Key Encryption
XRP Ledger’s core protocol
Blockchain developers
Fintech engineers
XRPL builders
Anyone curious about real-world cryptography in action






📢 Follow the series — we’ll be breaking down the XRPL layer by layer, from consensus algorithms to smart contract integration (Hooks), and more.

In this post, we’ll walk through creating a Pokémon type navigator (Fire, Electric, Water) using Angular 19 + lazy-loaded standalone components — no modules required.
✅ Use loadComponent() with Routes

✅ Declare and lazy load standalone components

✅ Create route-driven Pokémon screens
✅ No NgModule needed!

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide to get you set up:
Step 1: Set up your React Native project
If you already have a React Native project, you can skip this step.
If you&#x27;re starting fresh, create a new React Native project using your preferred method (React Native CLI or Expo).
React Native CLI:
npx react-native init MyAwesomeApp
cd MyAwesomeApp

Expo:
npx create-expo-app MyAwesomeApp
cd MyAwesomeApp

Step 2: Install NativeWind and Tailwind CSS
Now, let&#x27;s add the necessary packages:
npm install nativewind tailwindcss

You didn&#x27;t need a community.
You just needed to build it.
But today? Building is easy. Too easy.
AI writes your backend.
Execution is no longer your moat.
Everyone has the same tools.
You&#x27;re not competing on what you build.

That&#x27;s the new edge: emotional connection.
Not because it&#x27;s nice to have

Let&#x27;s be honest.
Most SaaS products today are perfectly functional.

It&#x27;s all so… sterile.
The most beloved products don&#x27;t just solve a problem.

We wrote docs assuming someone would read them. We wrapped our endpoints in auth flows and user interfaces. We expected a person, or maybe a service, on the other side.
But that’s already changing.
AI models are now consuming APIs directly. Not as passive data readers, but as active participants. They parse user intent, synthesize context, and trigger backend actions. They&#x27;re not just clients. They&#x27;re intermediaries.
And that changes everything.
When models call APIs, natural language stops being enough.
We like to imagine that models “understand” prompts, but in practice, they just compute probabilities over sequences of text. They don’t grasp nuance the way humans do. A tiny shift in phrasing can derail the whole interaction.

According to the report, 94% of employees have some familiarity with generative AI tools. Most execs estimated 4% of their teams already use AI heavily at work. However, the real figure is 12%, three times higher.

Even skeptics are on board. The report labels cautious employees as &quot;Gloomers&quot; (37% of the workforce), who want tight AI oversight, and &quot;Doomers&quot; (4%), who distrust AI outright. Yet 80% of Gloomers and 50% of Doomers say they’re comfortable using AI at work. That shows widespread readiness, not just enthusiasm from the usual suspects.

✅ Automated dynamic prompts and data modeling
from contextgem import Aspect, Document, DocumentLLM

# Define what to extract
doc &#x3D; Document(raw_text&#x3D;&quot;Your document text here...&quot;)
doc.aspects &#x3D; [
    Aspect(
        name&#x3D;&quot;Intellectual property&quot;,

# Extract with any LLM
llm &#x3D; DocumentLLM(model&#x3D;&quot;
/&quot;, api_key&#x3D;&quot;&quot;)
doc &#x3D; llm.extract_all(doc)

# Get results
print(doc.aspects[0].extracted_items)

Features a native DOCX converter, support for multiple LLMs, and full serialization - all under Apache 2.0 permissive license.

/**
 * Extracts the “plain” shape of your schema—
 * just the fields you defined, without Mongoose’s built-in methods or &#x60;_id&#x60;.
 */
export type User &#x3D; InferSchemaType;

/**
 * Represents a fully “hydrated” Mongoose document:
 * your fields plus all of Mongoose’s methods and metadata
 * (e.g. &#x60;_id&#x60;, &#x60;save()&#x60;, &#x60;populate()&#x60;, etc.).
 */
export type UserDocument &#x3D; HydratedDocument;

export const userModel &#x3D; model(&quot;user&quot;, userSchema);

InferSchemaType


• Produces a pure TypeScript type from your schema definition.
• Use it whenever you need just the data shape (e.g. DTOs, service inputs/outputs).
HydratedDocument


• Wraps your base type T with Mongoose’s document helpers.
• Use it for any function that deals with real, database-backed 
For example, in a repository interface you might write:
export interface IUserRepository {
  findOneByEmail(email: string): Promise;
  findById(id: Types.ObjectId): Promise;
  create(
    createUserDto: Pick,
  ): Promise;
}

Here, each method clearly promises a “live” Mongoose document (with built-in methods) while elsewhere you can rely on User for pure data shapes—keeping your boundaries and types crystal clear.

In contrast to batch processing, where data is collected and processed in chunks, streaming data processing deals with data in motion. Instead of waiting for data to accumulate before running transformations, streaming pipelines ingest and process each piece of data as it arrives. This model enables organizations to respond to events in real time, a capability that’s becoming increasingly essential in domains like finance, security, and customer experience.

For many data engineering tasks, real-time insights aren’t necessary. In fact, a large portion of the data processed across organizations happens in scheduled intervals—daily sales reports, weekly data refreshes, monthly billing cycles.

- UseMemo :
In JavaScript, objects and arrays are passed by reference. This means that during a re-render, even if their content doesn&#x27;t change, a new reference is created.
UseMemo come to address this issue and returns a memoized value.

Hybrid architectures combine elements of client-server and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems.

Goal:  
Take advantage of both models (client-server manageability + P2P scalability).

Solve the problems of purely decentralized systems (for example, low reliability or &quot;freeloaders&quot; in P2P).

Edge servers are located at the junction of networks:


Between the corporate network and the Internet (for example, for Internet service providers — ISPs).

Between users and the core of the Internet (for example, CDN servers).

An ML project to empower smarter agriculture decisions
GitHub Repo →
Agriculture remains the backbone of the Indian economy, yet farmers still face unpredictable yields due to varying environmental and input conditions. To tackle this issue, I built a machine learning model that predicts crop yield based on historical and input-based features.
This project is simple, beginner-friendly, and practical.
&quot;How can we accurately predict crop yield based on inputs like rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide use?&quot;
Farmers often rely on experience or guesswork. This model helps bring data-driven decision-making to the field.
The dataset includes:
Area
Production
Crop Year
Rainfall
Fertilizer
Pesticide
📌 Categorical features are label-encoded for model compatibility.
Python 🐍
Pandas &amp; NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (optional for plots)
I trained and evaluated three regression models:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor ✅ Best performer



  
  
  Evaluation Metrics:



R² Score
Adjusted R²
RMSE
Gradient Boosting gave the highest R² score on the test set and was chosen as the final model.
The script allows users to input values for the features and get instant yield predictions.
Clone the repo and run the script locally:
git clone https://github.com/h4ck3r0/crop-yielding-prediction
cd crop-yielding-prediction
python main.py

Add UI with Streamlit or Flask
Integrate with real-time weather APIs
Visual analytics for predictions
This is a practical application of ML in solving a real-world agricultural problem.

Simple experiment, obviously that 
This experiment shows that, ideally, a secure encryption scheme should give an attacker a probability of guessing bit b, tending to 1/2 (or 50%).

important:

Definition 3.18 says that a private key encryption scheme is secure when used repeatedly if an adversary (e.g. hacker) cannot distinguish the encryption of two different sets of messages.  
1.Security with multiple encryptions:
The enemy selects two sets of messages (for example, two lists).


One of them is encrypted, and the enemy is trying to guess which one it is.

If the scheme is secure, his chances of guessing are only slightly better than just flipping a coin (that is, 1/2 + very small value).

Once data has been ingested into your system, the next step is to prepare it for actual use. This typically involves cleaning, transforming, and storing the data in a way that supports analysis, reporting, or further processing. This is where data pipelines come in, and at the center of pipeline design are two common strategies: ETL and ELT.
Although they may look similar at first glance, ETL and ELT represent fundamentally different approaches to handling data transformation…</span>

It uses a permissive Apache 2 license and can be easily extended to create your own applications.
This is one of the few desktop applications (perhaps the only) to offer a multi-modal experience to non-technical users as they are able to download a packaged version from itch.io and run a setup wizard to get up and running without any technical barriers.

It&#x27;s important to prevent this information from being exposed in CLI output, logs, or source control. Terraform offers several features to help protect sensitive data and reduce the risk of accidental exposure.

Before we can analyze, model, or visualize data, we first need to get it into our systems. This step—often taken for granted—is known as data ingestion. It’s the bridge between the outside world and the internal data infrastructure, and it plays a critical role in how data is shaped from day one.
In this post, we’ll break down the types of data sources you’ll encounter, the ingestion strategies available, and what trade-offs to consider when designing ingestion workflows.

Using AI to Generate Seed Data for Supabase
Every developer knows the importance of having good seed data for fast testing and development. Manually crafting SQL queries to populate your database with realistic data can be tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex relationships between tables.
SupaSeeder connects to your Supabase instance, extracts the database schema, then you can either generate SQL insert statements or optimized prompts to use with any AI model to generate the seed data you need.
supaseeder.vercel.app 🔥



  
  
  ⚙️ How It Works




Provide Supabase URL &amp; Anon Key

Connects to your database and reads the schema.


Write a prompt

Describe the data you want (e.g. &quot;10 users with 5 posts each&quot;).


Pick mode





Prompt Mode: Get optimized prompts to use with any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
Direct Mode: Get complete SQL queries generated using OpenAI
Get SQL output
Copy &amp; paste to your SQL editor or Supabase SQL Runner.
Clone the repository:




   git clone https://github.com/mmvergara/supaseeder.git
   cd supaseeder

Install dependencies:




   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install

The controlnet-1.1-x-realistic-vision-v2.0 model takes a variety of inputs, including an image, a prompt, and various parameters to fine-tune the generation process. The output is a high-quality, realistic image that aligns with the provided prompt and input image.
Image: The input image that serves as a reference or starting point for the generation process.
Prompt: A text description that guides the model in generating the desired image.
Seed: A numerical value that can be used to randomize the generation process.
Steps: The number of inference steps to be taken during the generation process.
Strength: The strength or weight of the control signal, which determines how much the model should focus on the input image.
Max Width/Height: The maximum dimensions of the generated image.
Guidance Scale: A parameter that controls the balance between the input prompt and the control signal.
Negative Prompt: A text description that specifies elements to be avoided in the generated image.
Output Image: The generated, high-quality, realistic image that aligns with the provided prompt and input image.

                              <span>In the world of software development—especially with distributed systems and microservices—asynchronous messaging has become essential for building scalable and resilient applications. Two of the most common messaging patterns are queues and topics. While they might sound similar, their behavior and use cases are quite different.
In this post, I’ll explain what they are, how they differ, and when to use each one.
A queue follows a point-to-point communication model: messages are sent by a producer and consumed by only one consumer. Once a message is processed, it is removed from the queue.
Key characteristics:
Each message is processed by one and only one consumer.
Guarantees single delivery of each message.
Useful for load balancing between multiple consumers.
Maintains message order (FIF…</span>

  I’ve been vibe coding before it was a thing (Forbes wrote about it).



  
  
  Recently I’ve been finding extremely valid business ideas and sharing them with cool people. All of my ideas are validated by quantitative (trends/keyword search volume) analysis and qualitative (Reddit conversations) analysis.

Sounds funny though, doesn&#x27;t it?

My friend! 
The vibes demand far more of your respect.

                              <span>When working with Spring Boot and JPA, understanding how transactions and the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() operation interact can make or break your application&#x27;s data consistency and performance. Yet, I often see even experienced developers overlook the nuances!
Many believe that committing a transaction is the only way to persist changes to the database. However, the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() method forces the persistence context to synchronize with the underlying database immediately-without ending the transaction. This can be a game-changer for scenarios where you need to validate constraints or trigger database actions before the transaction completes.
But here’s the catch: improper use of 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() can lead to unexpected behaviors, performance overhead, or even data inconsistencies if not handled carefully. It&#x27;s crucial to know when and why to use it, especially in complex microservices or batch processing environments.
How do you approach transaction management and flushing in your Spring Boot projects? Have you ever faced a tricky bug or performance issue related to this? Share your experience or tips in the comments-let’s learn from each other!

I&#x27;ve always wanted to write a blog and create a tech YouTube channel — I think having a blog will have to be enough for now.

Well, my name is Rodrigo. I&#x27;m a recent CS graduate, and honestly, I&#x27;m just trying to understand where I fit in all of this.
I&#x27;ve always done a lot of things during college — organized events, created personal projects for the CS community at UFCG (which is the university I graduated from), and even joined a handful of partnership projects between the university and different companies.
It was great, don&#x27;t get me wrong. These were amazing experiences. But by the time I reached my final semesters, I thought I had everything figured out. I knew how to get into projects, how to organize events that really worked, and I felt like t…</span>

Conclusion
Dependency Injection (DI) is one of the most debated design patterns in software development. While opinions vary on whether it’s universally beneficial, one thing is certain: DI can be extremely useful if not treated as a &quot;golden hammer.&quot; Overusing it, such as blindly injecting every dependency, can lead to unnecessary complexity rather than cleaner code.
In this article, we’ll explore how DI can be effectively applied in Next.js, striking the right balance between maintainability and simplicity.

Hello friends, SQL (Structured Query Language) is one of the most essential skills for any Software Engineer. I would rate this skill as similar to system design and coding. 
If you are a professional programmer, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you are a Java, Golang, or .NET developer; you are bound to write SQL queries. 
Since the database is an integral part of any modern Java or Web application, the Interviewer always preferred candidates with excellent SQL skills. 
Now, the big question comes: How can a programmer learn SQL? Is knowing how to query a table enough? If you remember insert, update, delete, and select, then are you a…</span>

                              <span>Vector search is becoming a core workload for AI-driven applications. But do you really need to introduce a new system just to handle it?
We ran a performancebenchmark to find out: comparing PostgreSQL (using pgvector + pgvectorscale) with Qdrant on 50 million embeddings.
Sub-100ms query latencies
471 queries per second (QPS) on Postgres—11x higher throughput than Qdrant (41 QPS)
Head to the full write-up for a deep dive into our vector database comparison.

At 99% recall, Postgres delivers sub-100ms query latencies and handles 11x more query throughput than Qdrant (471 QPS vs. Qdrant’s 41 QPS).
The results show that thanks to pgvectorscale, Postgres can keep up with specialized vector databases and deliver as good, if not better performance at scale. Learn more about why Postgres wins for AI and vector workloads.
How? We built pgvectorscale to push Postgres to its limits for vector workloads—without compromising recall, latency, or cost-efficiency. It turns your favorite relational database into a high-performance vector search engine.
✅ No extra systems.
✅ No new query languages.
✅ Just Postgres.
We used RTABench to run a transparent, reproducible evaluation—designed for real-world, high-scale workloads.

                              <span>What is DevOps?


DevOps, as the name suggests, combines Development and Operations into a unified approach. A DevOps Engineer orchestrates the entire journey of an application: planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying, and monitoring. This comprehensive process ensures applications work seamlessly for end-users and integrate properly with other services.
I see DevOps Engineers as master planners who understand the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Success in this role requires both technical expertise and strong communication skills. Communication becomes crucial especially when coordinating across different teams – from developers to stakeholders.

                              <span>I was chatting with AWS Hero Matt Lewis on the topic of how to run MCP Servers via a container image, and realised that I had not actually tried this yet. So this post was inspired by that conversation, and I hope it helps anyone else who is looking to try it out.  In a previous post I introduced how Amazon Q CLI now supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) (check out Configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Amazon Q CLI for more details). 
This post will build on that and show you how to run MCP Servers via container images. As I switched to using Finch from Docker back in 2024, I will be using that - this means if you are using something different to Docker, like Podman for example, you should be able to follow along and use that tool too.

Welcome back to the last part peer review of the France Data Engineering Job Market Analysis pipeline. In Part 1, we explored the project’s infrastructure, cloud setup, and orchestration. Now, we’ll go deeper into the heart of the data platform: transformations, data warehouse design, dashboarding, reproducibility, and actionable feedback.
Modern data engineering pipelines are built on modular, testable transformations—and dbt (Data Build Tool) shines in this space. This project structures its dbt codebase into staging, core, and marts layers, following best practices for maintainability and scalability.
Staging Models: Clean and standardize raw job posting data.
Core Models: Build core analytical tables, e.g., fact_jobs, dim_company, dim_skills.

HTTP is the foundation of everything we build and interact with on the web — whether it’s a static website, a complex Single Page Application (SPA), a RESTful API, or a modern mobile app.
Every user action that triggers data exchange — from submitting a login form to loading an image — ultimately depends on HTTP.
Despite this, many developers treat HTTP as a black box: something that “just works” behind the scenes. While abstraction is useful, serious web developers must move beyond it.
Understanding how HTTP actually operates — from how requests are structured, to how connections are established, to how responses are transmitted — is essential for building high-quality, secure, and performant applications.

Welcome to the third peer review series for DataTalks Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp. In this post, I’ll be dissecting a real-world data engineering project that analyzes the French Data Engineering job market. The goal? To break down the project’s infrastructure, orchestration, and cloud design—spotlighting what works well, what could be improved, and, most importantly, what we can all learn as practicing data engineers.
Why do this? Because reviewing and sharing feedback on real-world projects sharpens our own skills, encourages open knowledge sharing, and helps us all grow together. Let’s dig in.

                              <span>The world of online dating has changed dramatically in the past few years — and artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a major role in that transformation. One emerging trend is AI dating pictures: profile photos generated or enhanced by AI to help users present their “best selves” on dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, or even social media platforms.
But what exactly are AI dating pictures, and are they a good idea? Let’s break it down.
AI dating pictures refer to profile photos that are either:
✅ Generated entirely by AI — using tools like AI portrait generators or avatars based on your real face.
✅** Enhanced or edited by AI** — improving lighting, removing blemishes, sharpening features, or even subtly reshaping facial features.
These photos aim to make you look more appealing wit…</span>

                              <span>When I started working with Dynamics CRM, ages ago, there were 2 topics that were the nightmare of all CRM devs:
Multi currency, aka exchange rate management
Time-zone management
Ages have passed, but those topics keep staying in the top 5 chart of my headaches-giver topics.
Just today, scrolling in my LinkedIn wall, I&#x27;ve found an interesting article from Nick Doelman that pointed to another article from 2021 where he solved the long-standing issue of updating exchange rates in the platform in an way that is
straightforward
elegant
deterministic
fast to set-up
and, above all, free!
It&#x27;s just a matter of leveraging the right tools, that in this case are:
https://exchangeratesapi.io/: a website that provides daily updated exchange rates with a compelling licensing model that allows up to 100 api calls per month for free!
a simple Power Automate flow.
Take a look at his article for details!
🙏🏻 Thanks Nick!

This is my story.
I had just graduated from university, full of fire and ambition. My degree wasn’t in tech, but I was drawn to the world of possibilities I saw in it. 
This was in the early 20-teens, and the buzzword floating everywhere was “Fullstack Developer.” YouTube was overflowing with success stories, “I went from zero to six figures in a year,” “How I became a Fullstack developer without a CS degree.” It was intoxicating.

                              <span>I have covered eBPF in my previous article. In this post, I&#x27;ll be covering Kepler specifically, which part of CNCF ecosystem.
Kepler is a monitoring and observability tool designed for Kubernetes clusters that uses eBPF to track the resource usage of containers and nodes. Unlike traditional monitoring solutions, which often rely on metrics collection agents running in user space, Kepler utilizes eBPF to gather resource consumption data directly from the kernel. This results in high precision and low overhead, which is essential for cloud-native environments.
Kepler is particularly useful for:
Resource Efficiency: Kepler provides detailed resource usage metrics for containers and Kubernetes workloads, allowing users to optimize resource allocation and avoid over-provisioning.

.json files?


You might be laughing a bit here. Of course .json and js goes hand in hand. Since the beginning of time we have used .json files to throw in config, mock data or see how many levels of data-indentation we can reach before we go crazy.
Well, what I want to do is have a data.json file where I &quot;mock&quot; all the data I want/need for a page so:
In practise this means I can simply import my file, and since I am not crazy and love using TypeScript, I can also type my data:
import rawData from &quot;./assets/data.json&quot;;

const myData: UserAboutMe &#x3D; rawData as UserAboutMe;

For developers working in blockchain and fintech infrastructure, this is more than a market headline—it’s a potential stress point for applications reliant on real-time price data, order execution, and network performance.
Understanding these macroeconomic triggers is critical for building resilient crypto-native systems.
Bitcoin is currently trading near the $59,000–$60,000 support zone after facing rejection from resistance at approximately $63,000 earlier this week. Despite brief recoveries, sentiment remains cautious ahead of economic data releases.

If you try to post on multiple platforms
The notation is slightly different.
Different tagging rules.
Different readerships (no one is nice to you)
Each ...... is so peculiar,
---.
So, I created this BlogTool.
--- ...
Markdown notation same as Qiita.


Word-like formatting buttons.


VSCode-like free layout


Automatic conversion for each service when posting


Automatic translation for overseas platforms


Graphically displays the number of views and likes after each post


Batch posting (API supported services only)



There are more things I want to implement, but I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to be Sakura da Familia, so I&#x27;ve released it once.
Just enter the API tokens for each platform from the configuration screen,

  1️⃣ Imagine a Pizza Menu 🍕


You walk into a pizza place and see a menu. The menu promises what pizzas they offer—but doesn’t make them yet.

An interface in Java is like that menu: it defines what a class should do, but not how!  
The menu says:  
&quot;All pizzas must have cheese 🧀&quot;

&quot;All pizzas must be bakeable 🔥&quot;
Any chef (class) who follows this menu must fulfill these rules! In Java, we call this &quot;implementing an interface.&quot;







  
  
  3️⃣ Multiple Menus, One Chef!


A chef can follow multiple menus (interfaces):  
Italian food menu 🍝

Fast food menu 🍔
Similarly, a Java class can implement many interfaces at once! (Unlike inheritance, where you only get one parent.)







  
  
  4️⃣ But… What If the Chef Cheats? 😱


If a chef says, &quot;I’ll follow the pizza menu!&quot; but doesn’t add cheese… BIG PROBLEM!

Java won’t allow this—it forces the class to implement every method in the interface, or the code won’t compile!  
What if some pizzas usually have tomato sauce, but not always?

Interfaces can now provide default methods—like a &quot;standard recipe&quot; that chefs can override if they want!  

java
interface Pizza {  
    default void addSauce() { System.out.println(&quot;Adding tomato sauce!&quot;); }  
}</span>

                              <span>From this article 2 Minute Tips: The Dark Secret of Optionals I got to know that the Optionals are nothing but an Enum . I started experimenting: How can we build Optional from scratch
You might have heard of Schrödinger’s Cat — the thought experiment where a cat in a box is both alive and dead until you check. That&#x27;s basically an Optional, right? A value that might exist... or not.
So, let&#x27;s turn this idea into code:
enum 📦 {
    case 😺(Value)
    case 😵

    init(_ from: Value) {
        self &#x3D; .😺(from)
    }
}

Now we can do:
let x: 📦 &#x3D; .😺(123)
let y: 📦 &#x3D; .😵

But that&#x27;s not quite as convenient as Swift&#x27;s native syntax: let x: Int? &#x3D; 123.
Can we make ours feel just as nice?
Swift lets types conform to ExpressibleByNilLiteral. Let’s do that:

Have you ever paused to wonder what really happens when you book a movie ticket online? What unfolds behind the scenes when you check show details or reserve your favorite seat? I’ve always been fascinated by the complexity beneath that simple click-and building SkyFox Cinema gave me the perfect opportunity to explore it firsthand.
SkyFox Cinema is a modern, full stack movie booking platform designed to help regional theaters embrace digital transformation. My goal was to empower local cinema owners with a robust, scalable system that leverages the latest in software engineering practices-while also challenging myself to solve real-world business and technical problems (this was a fictitious scenario I created for myself).

                              <span>The success of a mobile app heavily depends on its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). A well-designed app is intuitive, engaging, and keeps users coming back. On the other hand, a poorly designed app frustrates users, leading to uninstalls and negative reviews. With millions of apps competing for attention, a flawless UI/UX design can be the game-changer that sets your app apart.
Users appreciate an app that is easy to navigate. A cluttered and confusing interface overwhelms users, leading to higher bounce rates. Simplicity doesn’t mean your app should be bare-bones, but rather that it should be free from unnecessary elements that distract from the core functionality.
Minimize distractions by using a clean and structured layout. Every element should have a clear purpose.

Genymotion is by far the most widely used Android device emulation tool for auditing Android apps, due to its practicality and some of the features it offers. You can install it directly from the official website. It is worth remembering that Genymotion is, in principle, based on VirtualBox. It is worth remembering that Genym…</span>

                              <span>We need ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to enable communication between devices on a local network. Specifically, ARP is used to map an IP address (logical address) to a MAC address (physical address), which is necessary for data transmission at the data link layer.
ARP is a Layer 2 protocol used in IPv4 networks to map a known IP address to its corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) address. While IP addresses help devices find each other logically, MAC addresses are what Ethernet networks use to actually deliver packets. ARP acts as the translator between these two.
IP works at Layer 3 (Network Layer) but to actually send data over Ethernet (Layer 2), the system needs the MAC address of the destination device.

O Facade é um padrão de projeto do tipo estrutural. Ele consiste na criação de uma classe intermediária (ou fachada) que expõe uma interface simplificada para um conjunto de classes ou processos mais complexos.
Seu principal objetivo é desacoplar a lógica de negócios da complexidade de múltiplas instâncias e chamadas internas, permitindo que outras partes do sistema interajam com uma interface unificada e mais limpa. Isso melhora a organização do código, facilita a manutenção e reduz a dependência direta de implementações internas.

                              <span>Have you ever wondered how applications like hotkey managers or keystroke recorders work their magic? How do they intercept keystrokes even when they&#x27;re not in focus? The secret lies in something called &quot;keyboard hooks&quot; - a powerful yet somewhat mysterious feature of Windows programming.

In this blog post, we&#x27;ll demystify global keyboard hooks by building a simple WPF application that listens for the F1 key press anywhere in Windows. Whether you&#x27;re a beginner looking to understand Windows hooks or an experienced developer wanting to implement global hotkeys, this guide will walk you through the process step by step.
💪 Power in Your Hands: Once you master keyboard hooks, you can completely customize Windows&#x27; keyboard behavior - redirect keys to launch applications, block problematic keys,…</span>

In this guide, we&#x27;ll explore effective techniques for intercepting and blocking unwanted network requests in Puppeteer.
Blocking unnecessary requests offers several benefits:
Faster page loading - Skipping images, analytics, and ads can dramatically reduce load times
Reduced bandwidth usage - Especially important for cloud-based scraping or serverless functions
Lower memory consumption - Fewer resources to process means less memory used
Improved stability - Fewer network requests means fewer potential points of failure

                              <span>Hello everyone, today we are making a typography component for your Astro Js and Tailwind CSS project.
Originally posted : https://lexingtonthemes.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-typography-component-with-variants-with-astro-js-and-tailwind-css/
Why do we need a typography component?
Consistent typography is key to keeping your website looking clean and organized. Without it, things can start to look messy fast. A typography component helps keep text styling uniform across your whole site. The idea here is to make it both flexible and well-defined, so you get a good balance between structure and creativity, since not everything is just black and white. ‘</span>

                              <span>Welcome to part 4 in the series of shell scripting. Today we will look at a script that goes through an array with complex values. Complex values such as spaces, apostrophes, and quotes.
Scripting is the process of writing a set of instructions in a programming or scripting language to automate tasks that would otherwise be done manually. In the context of shell scripting, these instructions are written for the command-line shell, allowing users to perform complex operations - like file management, backups, or software installations - with just a single script execution. It&#x27;s a powerful tool for saving time and ensuring consistency in system administration and development workflows


Create the script in VIM, complex_list.sh



Write and save the script in VIM.



We can check whether it has been created  by doing ls -ltrh.



Give the permission so the script can be executed.



If we then do a ls –ltrh we can see the script has gained a green colour, meaning that it is now executable.



Output after executing the script by using the command ./




  
  
  Stay tuned, part 5 in the series coming tomorrow!

                              <span>Excelorithm, we build custom software solutions for startups, SMEs, and enterprise clients alike. And as the technical head here, I’ve seen a recurring pain point — many teams, including our own, spend way too much time setting up the basics of a SaaS product: authentication, subscriptions, dashboards, role management, notifications...
Sure, there are tons of SaaS starter kits out there, both free and premium. They promise speed — and often deliver — but usually at a hidden cost: vendor lock-in.
Many popular boilerplates rely on proprietary services, paid APIs, or tightly coupled ecosystems. That might be fine early on, but over time it limits your freedom, raises your costs, and ties you to someone else’s roadmap.
That’s why we built SaaSLaunchpad — a free, open-source Next.js SaaS starter kit with zero paid tool dependencies and no vendor lock-in.

Fair source software is a licensing model designed to balance the freedom of open source with the revenue potential of proprietary software. This blog post explores the history, core concepts, practical applications, challenges, and future innovations of fair source software. By blending aspects of open access with commercial monetization, fair source software offers an alternative ecosystem where developers can engage communities while earning sustainable revenue. We also compare fair source with traditional licensing models using tables and bullet lists for clarity. Furthermore, we discuss additional facets such as funding strategies and legal complexities that shape this emerging model in the digital landscape.

                              <span>INTRODUCTION:
But exactly is the purpose of the Node Operators in the Catalysis Ecosystem? well let&#x27;s get into that now.
They power the services (AVSs) by doing important technical tasks.
They also help protect the network by locking up funds (called 
staking)—this keeps them honest.
If they do something wrong, they can lose money so they have a 
strong reason to act fairly.
I&#x27;m pretty sure at this point you can fairly understand why they are called the backbone of the network. Basically without them nothing would work.
HOW DOES CATALYSIS WORK IN RELATION TO THE NODE OPERATORS?
Normally, running these services on many platforms is complicated and 
expensive.
Catalysis simplifies this by giving them one tool (Catalyst-CLI) 
to manage everything in one place.

Any service that&#x27;s meant to live more than couple of weeks eventually reaches the stage where you feel the need to properly monitor it. You usually start with simple console.log logging, but soon realize it&#x27;s not readable enough, it&#x27;s not searchable enough and it&#x27;s only available on your server. Probably inside Docker container.
I was exactly at that point, annoyed by constant need to ssh into my server to check one log line. I&#x27;ve wanted to play with Grafana ecosystem for a while, too. So it seemed to be the perfect moment.
In this post, I’ll walk you through a simple and minimal setup that streams my Node.js application&#x27;s logs into the Grafana Cloud dashboard using Grafana Alloy and Loki.

                              <span>As deep learning models grow in size and complexity, the demand for efficient computation has never been higher. One of the key contributors to computational efficiency in machine learning is the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). In 2025, PyTorch continues to set the benchmark for leveraging GPU acceleration. This guide delves into the steps and nuances of using GPU acceleration in PyTorch.
GPUs are designed to handle parallel operations, making them perfect for the complex computations required in training deep learning models. Using a GPU, you can significantly speed up processes such as matrix operations and tensor computations.
Before diving into GPU acceleration in PyTorch, ensure you have the following:

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Two Pointers, String, Dynamic Programming
There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.
After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.
You are given a string dominoes representing the initial state where:

                              <span>By default, Spring Data JPA loads related data lazily, which can cause the N+1 problem — one query for the main data and more for each related item. @EntityGraph annotation fixes this by letting you load related data in a single query, without changing your entity mapping. It’s simple, improves performance, and avoids writing custom JOIN FETCH queries.
Let’s say you have a Post entity that references an Author.
Entities
@Entity
public class Post {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String title;

    @ManyToOne(fetch &#x3D; FetchType.LAZY)
    private Author author;
}

@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}

Repository
public interface PostRepository extends JpaRepository {

    // attributePaths specifies related entities to eagerly load
    @EntityGraph(attributePaths &#x3D; {&quot;author&quot;})
    List findAll();
}

Now, if you create a simple controller to return all posts and have SQL logging enabled, you&#x27;ll see the queries printed in the console.
With @EntityGraph, only one query runs to fetch both the post and its author. Without it, multiple queries are executed — one for the posts and one for each author — which is the N+1 problem.
✅ Using @EntityGraph
Only one query — fast and efficient.
select p.id, p.title, a.id, a.name
from post p
left join author a on p.author_id &#x3D; a.id

🚨 Not Using @EntityGraph
N+1 queries — slow and wasteful.
select * from post;
select * from author where id &#x3D; ?;
select * from author where id &#x3D; ?;</span>

To explore this question, I launched an experimental project: a sommelier chatbot. Wine is a domain rich with variety and unfamiliar terms—perfect for testing how helpful an AI assistant can be in guiding users through complex needs and how naturally it can be integrated into a real application interface.
This project focused on:
Designing an AI chatbot that recommends wines through real-time conversation
Embedding the chatbot within an actual chat interface
Gaining insights on conversational UX—such as message flow, context awareness, and user engagement

                              <span>A construção de aplicações com Large Language Models (LLMs) evoluiu rapidamente. Frameworks como LangChain nos deram as ferramentas para conectar LLMs com fontes externas, memória, e agentes capazes de tomar decisões. Mas à medida que a complexidade dos fluxos aumenta, surge um desafio comum: como orquestrar o comportamento dos agentes de forma flexível, controlável e com lógica mais rica que simples pipelines lineares?
É aqui que entra o LangGraph.
O que é o LangGraph?


O LangGraph é uma extensão do LangChain que permite construir fluxos de execução orientados a grafos para LLMs e agentes. Em vez de seguir uma sequência fixa de passos (como num pipeline tradicional), você define nós (nodes) e arestas (edges) que representam o comportamento dinâmico do sistema.

Así nace este proyecto: una herramienta educativa, poderosa y funcional para convertir historias de usuario en:
✅ Casos de prueba manuales
✅ Escenarios BDD en Gherkin
✅ Pruebas automatizadas con Playwright + Python
Este proyecto está diseñado para mostrar que la Inteligencia Artificial puede integrarse de forma sencilla y efectiva en el ciclo QA.
A pesar de ser un proyecto básico, tiene bases sólidas que lo convierten en una excelente forma de:
Entender el potencial de los agentes IA
Automatizar tareas repetitivas (como escribir escenarios)
Adaptarse fácilmente a cualquier equipo o herramienta de gestión QA
Ahorrar tiempo real en tus procesos

                              <span>Issues with Existing Formatting Tools


When working with data structures like lists or NumPy arrays in Python,

the standard print or pprint, or even external tools like rich, often fail to provide a clear view of the entire structure,

especially when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or deeply nested data, making it easy to lose track of which element corresponds to which.
Let&#x27;s consider the following example as an illustration.
sample &#x3D; [
    {&quot;user&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;scores&quot;: [95, 88, 76]}},
    {&quot;user&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;002b&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;scores&quot;: [72, 85, 90]}},
    {&quot;bug_user&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: [3], &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;scores&quot;: [100, [50, 40], 70]}},
]

 — The “Pitfalls” of Data Structures


Python&#x27;s lists, dictionaries, and NumPy arrays are fine to work with for simple structures.…</span>

                              <span>Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has released its financials for the first quarter of 2025, disclosing nearly $120 billion in exposure to US Treasurys and over $1 billion in operating profit.
According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets.

According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company&#x27;s excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March.

Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “decoupling” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&amp;P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment.

In an interview with Cointelegraph&#x27;s Sam Bourgi at Token2049, Elissar said that stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, the intersection between AI and crypto, alternative use cases such as decentralized science, and Web3 gaming were all niches the company is exploring.
Gaming is &quot;part of our DNA,&quot; the executive said before reflecting on the current state of the Web3 gaming industry:

“I think it’s a missed opportunity,” Independent Reserve founder Adrian Przelozny told Cointelegraph. “Neither side has made crypto a headline issue because they’re wary of polarizing voters or sounding too niche.”
But the good news is that after more than a decade of inaction, both the ruling Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the opposition Liberal Party are promising to enact crypto regulations developed in consultation with the industry. 
In April, Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor promised to release draft crypto regulations within the first 100 days after taking office, while the Treasury itself h…</span>

Eisenberg was initially scheduled to be sentenced in July 2024 following his guilty plea on the child porn charge. In May 2024, the judge suggested the sentencing for both cases would occur simultaneously in a consolidated proceeding. However, as of May 1, the fraud sentencing remains …</span>

Michael Saylor&#x27;s Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has reported earning a year-to-date yield of 13.7% on its Bitcoin holdings as it missed Wall Street&#x27;s first-quarter estimates.
The company said in its May 1 earnings statement that its year-to-date Bitcoin (BTC) yield equates to a gain of more than 61,000 BTC, worth approximately $5.8 billion. Bitcoin yield and gain are unofficial accounting metrics Strategy uses to benchmark the success of its BTC buys. 
Strategy’s chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, said it would increase its Bitcoin yield target for this year to 25% and its Bitcoin gain target to $15 billion.

Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by August or September of this year if BTC breaks above the parabolic slope pattern. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price jumped to new quarterly highs at $96,700 on May 1, a day after the US GDP contracted -0.3% for the first time since Q2 2022. Amid heightened economic concerns, the probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut rose to 62.8% for the June 18 Federal Reserve meeting.

                              <span>Paolo Ardoino, CEO of stablecoin issuer Tether, addressed criticism over the company&#x27;s decision not to seek registration under the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework, arguing that the regulations were risky for stablecoins.
Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, Ardoino reiterated that Tether had no plans to apply for its US dollar-pegged stablecoin USDt — the largest by market capitalization — to be compliant under MiCA in European countries, potentially forcing exchanges to delist the stablecoin. He added that though crypto firms had to follow regulations, there was a “fear of compliance” among companies in the EU.

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security.

                              <span>The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

                              <span>Ethereum developers are working to improve blockchain interoperability with two new token standards: ERC-7930 and ERC-7828.
“There’s no standard way for wallets, apps, or protocols to interpret or display this information,” decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem development organization Wonderland wrote in a May 1 X post. Wallets, decentralized applications (DApps), block explorers and smart contracts follow different rules.
“The result? A messy, inconsistent experience that breaks cross-chain UX,“ Wonderland stated.
Wonderland is a group of developers, researchers and data scientists focused on improving the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. The organization partnered with multiple DeFi protocols, including Optimism, Aztec, Connext and Yearn.

21Shares on April 30 submitted the Form S-1 registration for a spot Sui (SUI) ETF to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Called the 21Shares Sui ETF, the proposed ETF will issue common shares of beneficial interest by seeking to track the performance of SUI held by 21Shares’ US subsidiary.
The US filing comes a year after 21Shares started trading the 21Shares Sui Staking exchange-traded product in Europe in July 2024, with its first listings on Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam.

Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…</span>

According to a May 1 Bloomberg report, the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026. The plan is still in early development, and the bank is said to be exploring partnerships with established crypto firms to power the service. Internal discussions about cryptocurrency support reportedly began in late 2024.

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates sooner than expected.

                              <span>Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX will use a stablecoin linked to US President Donald Trump’s family to settle a $2 billion investment in Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange.
The World Liberty Financial USD (USD1) US dollar-pegged stablecoin was launched by the Trump-associated crypto platform World Liberty Financial (WLFI) in March 2025.
MGX will use the USD1 stablecoin for its $2 billion investment in the Binance exchange, according to an announcement by Eric Trump during a panel discussion at Token2049 in Dubai. Trump, the son of the president, serves as executive vice president of the Trump Organization.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

                              <span>Trading platform Robinhood has still managed to beat Wall Street estimates as its first-quarter revenues fell and its crypto trading volume cooled from a record high in Q4.
Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.
Crypto trading volume on Robinhood also fell 35% over Q1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, which the firm attributed to a 10% drop in customer trades placed and a 27% fall in average notional volum…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

This technical blog post outlines the implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Amazon Nova Act on Amazon ECS Fargate platform as a container, providing browser automation capabilities as a service. 
Amazon Nova Act is an early research preview AI model and SDK designed to enable developers to build reliable web agents that can perform actions within a web browser. By integrating Nova Act with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), its browser automation capabilities can be standardized and exposed to diverse clients (e.g., AI assistants, web UIs, IDE extensions) through multiple communication channels:

Imagine you&#x27;re sitting in your favorite coffee shop, casually browsing your bank account on public Wi-Fi. Everything looks normal—padlock icon, HTTPS, the familiar interface. But in the shadows, a silent observer is watching, recording, and possibly altering everything you send. This is not science fiction; it&#x27;s the chilling reality of a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack.
With the explosion of remote work, IoT devices, and public connectivity, MITM attacks are more relevant than ever. For developers, IT professionals, and security teams, the danger lies in the illusion of secure communication. The article you&#x27;re about to read dives deep into how these attacks operate, the real-world damage they cause, and how to guard against them.

図２はDeepRAGの全体像であり、この仕組みでRetrieval Narrative(クエリ分解) と atomic decision(検索するかしないかの判断)を行う。
DeepRAGでは、検索強化推論のプロセスを以下の4つの要素からなるMDPとしてモデル化する：​
各ステップにおける状態は、元のクエリとそれまでのサブクエリとその応答の履歴

In React, conditional rendering allows you to dynamically render different UI components based on certain conditions. You can use JavaScript logic such as if statements, the ternary operator (? :), the logical AND (&amp;&amp;), or assign JSX to variables.
Using if Statements


The simplest way to conditionally render components is by using if statements inside a function component.
Example:





function AlertMessage({ show }) {
  if (!show) {
    return null;
  }
  return 
This is an alert message!
;
}

export default function App() {
  return ;
}

In this example, if show is false, the component returns null and nothing is rendered.
Using Ternary Operator (? :)


The ternary operator is a compact way to return di…</span>

                              <span>MongoDB has been a popular database choice for JavaScript developers for years, thanks to its flexible document model and natural fit with JavaScript objects. While MongoDB&#x27;s native driver and tools like Mongoose offer ways to work with the database, Prisma ORM provides a complementary approach that enhances the development experience.
MongoDB stores data in collections of JSON-like documents with flexible schemas. This flexibility enables rapid iteration and adaptability to changing requirements. Prisma ORM complements this flexibility by providing:
Type-safe database access: Generated TypeScript types based on your schema.


Clear schema management: A declarative schema that documents your data structure.

Let’s review the steps for setting up toasts:
User submits comment form (via Turbo).
Rails controller saves comment, sets flash[:notice]

Rails renders create.turbo_stream.erb

The turbo_stream.append renders the _toast.html.erb partial with the flash message
The browser receives the Turbo Stream response.
Turbo appends the new toast HTML (containing data-controller&#x3D;&quot;toast&quot;) into the 

Stimulus sees the new data-controller&#x3D;&quot;toast&quot; element
Stimulus initializes a new ToastController instance for this element
The controller’s connect() method runs
connect() uses Bootstrap to show() the toast
Bootstrap automatically hides the toast after 3 seconds</span>

                              <span>🚀 Introduction


Have you ever run a SQL query that just took forever and wondered, &quot;Why is this so slow?&quot; You&#x27;re not alone. Databases are fast until they&#x27;re not. And one of the simplest, yet most powerful performance tricks in SQL is indexing.
What indexing really means in MySQL 


Why indexes are performance game changers


The exact results of an experiment we ran on 80,000+ records in 


MySQL 5.7 on a local setup (8GB RAM, SSD)


When indexing helps and when it doesn&#x27;t



Let&#x27;s dive in.

Think of an index like a book&#x27;s table of contents. If you need Chapter 8, you don&#x27;t flip through every single page you jump straight to it. That&#x27;s what MySQL does with an index.
Primary Index(based on the primary key)
Unique Index (for ensuring uniqueness)
Composite Index (on multiple columns)

Hello everyone! Welcome to the second entry in my reading journey series. This time I have managed to read only 5 books. While I’m a little bit behind on my Goodreads goal of reading 52 books in the year, the last couple of months have been very busy with the end of the academic winter term. Now that I’m done with classes, I’m sure that I can have more time for reading and hopefully catch up to my goal. Let’s go into the reviews for this entry!

I briefly mentioned in the last entry that I was starting to read a collection of Celtic fairy tales and lore that my dad gifted me for Christmas. The first book in this collection is Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland by Lady Wilde. It contains a varied recollection of folklore and fairy tales.
Overall, I liked…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
After doing my first job as a frontend engineer in a startup for an year, I left my job. Their are multiple reasons for it, but that was the story of another time.
After that I decided to not pursue the tech career and start my chocolate factory - HAKI, a chocolate spread idea that crossed my mind.


If anyone is thinking, why making a chocolate spread would be so hard, like I thought initially, my 1st two variants caught fungus within a week.

Long time, messaging a hundred people for advice and many failed attempts, now I&#x27;m here finally — with the most delicious recipe made using clean, wholesome ingredients to keep it truly healthy.
Ahh and please follow Haki on @eathaki_ to know more about it.

We&#x27;re still on the lookout for a graphic designer who&#x27;s excited to help build HAKI — feel free to drop me an email if someone comes to mind.
Thank you so much for reading it till here 😊

Also, if there&#x27;s a better place to share this, please let me know.</span>

I previously served as the General Secretary of an association based in Brisbane. Throughout the year, we host around three events where professional photographers capture numerous high-quality images. Some of these photos can be as large as 18MB.
Once the events conclude, the pictures need to be uploaded to Google Albums and shared with our community. At our most recent event, the total upload size reached 5GB.
I had previously implemented an image resizer in php which I executed by running
php process.php imageprocessing  [ []]

The files in the input folder were processed sequentially, which worked well for a small number of images and for smaller file sizes—around 5MB. 
However, when handling a large volume of files, the process became …</span>

In this post, we explore how corporate sponsorship is driving blockchain innovation through financial backing, strategic partnerships, technological support, and marketing endorsements. We delve into the background of blockchain, explain its transformative capabilities, present case studies like IBM’s role in Hyperledger and Microsoft’s Azure Blockchain, and discuss challenges and future outlooks. Additionally, we offer practical examples, a comprehensive table comparing sponsorship types, and bullet lists of key benefits and challenges, all optimized for both search engines and human readers.

React&#x27;s component-based design enables developers to deconstruct intricate user interfaces into smaller, more manageable components. However, the quality of the React components could decrease as applications get bigger and more complicated, resulting in jumbled, difficult-to-maintain code.
The best approaches to developing cleaner React components will be discussed in this post. This useful tutorial will help you increase readability, maintainability, and performance whether you&#x27;re new to React or trying to make your current codebase better.
For a project to succeed over the long run, writing code that is clear, effective, and maintainable is important. Tests, refactoring, and comprehension are all made …</span>

                              <span>Modern .NET applications often rely on external services for data, messaging, and more.
Here are a few problems you can suffer when calling external APIs:
Transient failures: An external service might be slow or unreachable for a brief moment.
Partial outages: Another system could be in maintenance mode, limiting your access.
Network instability: Users with slow internet connections might experience short outages or timeouts.
Overloaded service: Another service could be overloaded with requests, leading to slow responses.
Networks are unstable, and you will suffer such problems sooner or later.
Here is the phrase that changed how I think about building resilient systems:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a modern approach to provisioning cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or OpenTofu. These technologies improve scalability, repeatability, and automation—but they can also introduce security risks if the code is misconfigured. For example, exposing an S3 bucket to the public or disabling encryption can lead to serious data breaches.
This article introduces CoGuard, a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool designed specifically to analyze configuration files used in infrastructure code. We’ll demonstrate how to scan Terraform code, interpret results, and automate the scanning process in a CI/CD workflow.

Firefox is a powerful, free, and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. The journey of Firefox began in **2002, when it was initially launched under the name *“Phoenix”. Due to trademark conflicts, it was later renamed *“Firebird”, and finally, in **2004, it became known as *“Firefox”*.
The main objective was to offer a lightweight, secure, and flexible browser alternative to the then-dominant Internet Explorer. Firefox quickly became popular due to its faster performance, tabbed browsing, and support for third-party **extensions (add-ons).
Over time, Firefox introduced several innovations such as:
Private Browsing Mode
Enhanced Tracking Protection
Reader Mode
Quantum Engine for improved speed and performance
Today, Firefox remains one …</span>

Even advanced LLMs often operate in isolation, limited by the data they were trained on and disconnected from live information or the ability to act within external systems. Connecting AI to these services traditionally involved building custom, difficult-to-scale integrations for each data source.

Let’s take your JavaScript skills to the next level! 💻🚀

Using var Instead of let and const


We all know JavaScript has come a long way, but some developers still rely on var. This can lead to unexpected behavior due to its function-scoped nature. let and const are block-scoped, providing better predictability in your code.

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, 2025 has ushered in a paradigm shift known as vibe coding. Coined by AI researchers, vibe coding represents a transition from traditional, syntax-heavy programming to a more intuitive, AI-assisted approach where developers articulate their intentions in natural language, and AI tools generate the corresponding code.
At its core, vibe coding is about conveying the desired functionality or behavior of software through conversational prompts. Instead of meticulously writing out code line by line, developers describe what they want the software to do, and AI models translate these descriptions into executable code. This method emphasizes clarity of thought and design over manual co…</span>

Will AI Take My Job?
Anita Olsen ・ Apr 22

Sure, we code daily and AI shines at spitting out code. But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.
Apart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:
Inter-team planning
Brainstorming sessions
Putting late sprints back on track
Designing requirements and user stories
Decomposing a full project into milestones
Scoping tasks with Product people
Reviewing architecture designs
Negotiating deadlines
Talking to clients
And that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can&#x27;t replace that human interaction yet.
But sure, our job as coders will change. Even if we&#x27;re skeptical about AI, we can&#x27;t ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us. We have to adapt.
We won&#x27;t be code monkeys anymore, cracking lines of code in exchange for bananas. AI will handle that. And if AI will change everything, let it at least kill dumb SCRUM ceremonies.

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

“In the early days, only a few companies approached compliance in a serious way,” Smith told Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event. “Coinbase was our first customer — they knew from the start that they wanted to build their business that way. But for most others, it just wasn’t a major priority.”Elliptic co-founder James Smith at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph

&quot;I think freedom of money is important, but to have freedom of money, you have to have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is kind of the bottom line. If you don&#x27;t have that, nothing — no other freedom — works.&quot;

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&amp;P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…</span>

                              <span>Bloomberg Intelligence has boosted its estimated odds of US regulators approving a Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2025 to 90%, according to an April 30 post on the X platform. 
The company also set more favorable chances of approval for other altcoin ETFs, including proposed funds holding XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in an X post. 
The estimates reflect an improved outlook from Bloomberg analysts. In a February analysis, Bloomberg pegged the odds of a Solana (SOL) ETF approval at only 70%. They ascribed a 65% and 75% chance of approval to funds holding XRP and DOGE, respectively. 
As of April 30, six asset managers — including Grayscale, VanEck and 21Shares — are awaiting clearance from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list ET…</span>

In an April 30 filing in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), lawyers for Coinbase argued that a First Circuit Court of Appeals decision set a “dangerous precedent” for crypto users, potentially allowing the government to “trace users’ every crypto transaction in the past and monitor every crypto transaction in the future.” The appeal to the Supreme Court stemmed from petitioner James Harper, a Coinbase user, who took legal action against the IRS after the crypto exchange was forced to turn over transaction data to the government using a sweeping “John Doe…</span>

Stablecoins’ cumulative market cap currently stands at roughly $230 billion, but “[e]volving market dynamics [have] the potential to accelerate stablecoins’ trajectory to reach ~$2tn in market cap by 2028,” the Treasury said in the April 30 report. 
A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar. According to the report, such tokens are already “ubiquitously utilized as ‘cash on-chain,’ effectively serving as a new payment mechanism.”

ETH is retesting its long-term parabolic support zone that preceded its historic 2017 rally.

The MVRV Z-Score has entered the accumulation zone, signaling undervaluation.

Ethereum’s native token, Ether (ETH), is flashing a combination of technical and onchain signals once seen in the early stages of its 2017 bull run, a cycle that produced over 25,000% gains.

Bitcoin’s price increased by sixfold each time its age increased by 40%.

If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could rally to $351,046 in 2025.

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.
Despite the dismal price action, dismissing Ethereum as a relic may be premature. The network continues to evolve, and th…</span>

                              <span>Blockchain payments firm Ripple has reportedly bid up to $5 billion in an effort to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle, but the offer was rejected.
According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally.

In an exclusive interview, Markova described the competition with dollar-pegged stablecoins as “all about sovereignty.” She compared the situation to earlier tensions between governments and US payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamic with stablecoins — on a smaller scale for now — but they’re definitely emerging as a new arena for sovereign concerns,” she said.

US GDP shrank -0.3% in Q1, far below +0.3% forecasts, sparking recession fears.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023. Polymarket odds of a recession in 2025 hit 67%, with consumer confidence at its lowest since May 2020.

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&amp;P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…</span>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it.

On April 2, Trump levied “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on 185 countries and territories. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,200 points on April 4, while the S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 6%, its largest decline since March 2020.

Prover V2 has 671 billion parameters, making it significantly larger than its predecessors, Prover V1 and Prover V1.5, which were released in August 2024.

In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy.
The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols.

                              <span>An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…</span>

                              <span>The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control can’t restore or reimpose sanctions against the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash, a US federal court has ruled.
Austin federal court judge Robert Pitman said in an April 28 judgment that OFAC’s sanctions on Tornado Cash were unlawful and that the agency was “permanently enjoined from enforcing” sanctions.
Tornado Cash users led by Joseph Van Loon had sued the Treasury, arguing that OFAC’s addition of the platform’s smart contract addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list was “not in accordance with law.” 
OFAC had sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, accusing the protocol of helping launder crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking collective, the Lazarus Group.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Richard Byworth says Michael Saylor’s Strategy could ramp up its Bitcoin buys by acquiring cash-rich companies and converting their cash into Bitcoin.

He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline.

Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy’s mNAV, benefiting shareholders.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says.
“Saylor’s strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast.

There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals.
The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they’ll be told to “use it or lose it.”

In an April 29 X post, tech commentator Jacob Canfield shared a scam letter sent to his home via post that appeared to be from Ledger claiming he needed to immediately perform a “critical security update” on his device. 
The letter, which uses Ledger’s logo, business address, and a reference number to feign legitimacy, asks to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s private recovery phrase under the guise of validating the device.
The letter threatens that “failure to complete this mandatory validation process may result in restricted access to your wallet and funds.”

                              <span>Key points:

Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.

If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.

Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening. 
According to a US Labor Department JOLTS report released on April 29, job openings in March approached their lowest levels in four years. US employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, below the…</span>

                              <span>Bettors on prediction platforms Polymarket and Kalshi are flipping bearish on the US economy. As of April 29, both platforms are predicting that the US will log an economic contraction during the first quarter of 2025 in an upcoming economic data release. 
The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession.
The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours.

Fidelity Digital Assets says Bitcoin is undervalued and the firm holds an optimistic mid-term outlook.

The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. 

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” 
As proof,  the firm cited the ‘Bitcoin Yardstick’ metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network. 
In Q1 2025, the metric stayed between -1 and 3 standard deviations, cooling from its Q4 2024 overheated levels. The number of days above 2-standard deviations dropped from 22 to 15, …</span>

                              <span>The Bank of Italy identified Bitcoin and other digital assets as emerging risk factors in a recent report, citing concerns for both investors and the financial system.
In its April 2025 Financial Stability Report, the Bank of Italy flags crypto volatility and rising integration with the broader economy, singling out stablecoins and non-financial firms’ crypto exposure as key concerns.
&quot;The strong growth of Bitcoin and of other crypto-assets with high price volatility means risks not only for investors but also potentially for financial stability, given the growing interconnections between the digital asset ecosystem, the traditional financial sector and the real economy,” the report notes.

                              <span>A court in India has ordered the encrypted email service Proton Mail blocked in the country for refusing to share information with authorities.
In an April 29 hearing of the High Court of Karnataka, Justice M Nagaprasanna ordered the government to “block forthwith” domain names associated with Proton Mail, citing authority under the country’s Information Technology Act of 2008. The order stemmed from a complaint filed in January by a New Delhi-based design firm, alleging that some of its employees received offensive emails through the service.  
It’s unclear whether the ban will take effect or face other possible challenges in court. The Proton team reported in March 2024 that Indian authorities had similarly proposed ordering the service blocked in response to alleged “hoax bomb threats,”…</span>

The US regulator has delayed its deadline for ruling on the proposed ETF listings until June, according to two filings reviewed by Cointelegraph. 
The filings were responses to March requests from US exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX Exchange to list Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and Franklin Templeton’s XRP (XRP) ETF, respectively. 
They came on the same day that Nasdaq, another US exchange, asked for permission to list a 21Shares Dogecoin ETF.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals.

In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.

Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors’ inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.

Fidelity Digital Assets’ report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum&#x27;s layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.
The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin’s favor.

The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF, shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Polkadot (DOT). 
Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund. The request amounts to a regulatory review process that could determine whether Dogecoin becomes accessible to a broader range of investors through an ETF structure.

AI has been a dominant narrative since 2024, but users and companies still cannot completely trust it. Whether it’s finances, personal data or healthcare decisions, hesitation around AI’s reliability and integrity remains high.
This growing AI trust deficit is now one of the most significant barriers to widespread adoption. Decentralized, privacy-preserving technologies are quickly being recognized as viable solutions that offer verifiability, transparency and stronger data protection without compromising AI’s growth.

Bitcoin’s most recently-moved supply segment is increasing as higher prices see an influx of “speculative capital.”

“Hot supply” has doubled in just five weeks versus local lows in March.

Active address numbers have yet to mimic a classic bull market comeback.

Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders (STHs) are back in the game as a “speculative capital” enters the market.
In an X thread on April 29, onchain analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”

Bitrace defines high-risk blockchain addresses as those used by illegal entities to receive, transfer or store stablecoins.
Crypto compliance firms typically score crypto wallet addresses based on their likelihood of involvement in illicit activities. The higher the risk, the higher the likelihood of foul play, and the less likely compliant crypto businesses are to accept the assets.
Per the report, the amount accounted for roughly 5.14% of all stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. This is down 0.8% from 5.94% the previous year, but significantly higher than the 2.8% reported in 2022 and 1.63% in 2021.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.

Miden closed its $25 million seed rounds led by a16z Crypto, 1kx, and Hack VC, with participation from Finality Capital Partners, Symbolic Capital, P2 Ventures, Delta Fund, MH Ventures, as well as from angel investors, including MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen and EigenLayer’s Sreeram Kannan.
