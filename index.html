HTML All The Things is a web development podcast and discord community which was started by Matt and Mike, developers based in Ontario, Canada. 
The podcast speaks to web development topics as well as running a small business, self-employment and time management. You can join them for both their successes and their struggles as they try to manage expanding their Web Development business without stretching themselves too thin.
In this episode, Matt sits down with Tom Barrasso from Cloud Phone to explore why flip phones are still relevant in 2025. They discuss the rise of digital detox, who’s using feature phones today, and how developers can still build apps for low-spec devices.

License-Token introduces an innovative licensing system that leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, and digital tokenization to revolutionize open source licensing. This blog post explores the background, core concepts, practical use cases, challenges, and future opportunities of License-Token. We also examine how traditional open source licenses such as GPL, MIT, and Apache compare to License-Token’s cutting-edge approach, and how the platform can empower developers, streamline compliance, and unlock monetization opportunities.
Open source software has long been a catalyst for innovation by enabling developers around the world to collaborate, share, and iterate on code. However, existing licensing models struggle with legal complexity, interoperability, and monetizat…</span>

                              <span>Just the other day I was testing a permissions function when I came across something very interesting about Array.prototype.every. So, let me give you a little back story. The function I was testing is a a very simple one that check whether a user has permissions required to access given module or action. This function happened to use the JS array method called every
How every works is that it loops through the array and checks whether all items satisfy a provided condition. If it encounters any item that doesn’t it break the loop and returns false, however if all items satisfy the conditions then true is returned. However, there is a peculiar behavior to this method in that if an empty array is used then true is still returned. This is where the concept of vacuous truth comes in

This approach separates responsibilities cleanly between:
Client: JavaScript
Logic: Plugins
Integrations: Power Automate
We start with a JavaScript function that triggers a bound action, keeping the UI lightweight and offloading processing to the server.
Xrm.WebApi.online.execute({
  entityName: &quot;quote&quot;,
  entityId: quoteId,
  actionName: &quot;new_CustomWinQuoteAction&quot;
});

The Custom Action serves as a reusable interface layer that:
Accepts input parameters
Supports versioning and audit
Can be triggered from JavaScript, Power Automate, or other Plugins

                              <span>Debugging is a crucial phase in software development, allowing developers to track down and fix bugs in their code. One feature that significantly enhances the debugging experience in Visual Studio (VS) is the ability to view objects&#x27; values inline while stepping through your C# code. If you&#x27;ve noticed that your colleagues can see values inline when debugging but you can&#x27;t, don&#x27;t worry! This article will guide you through the steps necessary to enable this feature and make your debugging sessions more efficient.
Understanding Inline Values in Visual Studio
Inline values provide a convenient way to monitor variable states without having to hover over them or check the Watch window. This feature is particularly useful for tracking down issues quickly as it allows you to see how variable valu…</span>

En este post veremos como convertir un bucle foreach de un estilo imperativo a un estilo funcional, además de cómo filtrar elementos de acuerdo a una condición.
En Java 5 se introdujo la sintaxis de foreach, la cual se utiliza para iterar sobre colecciones de elementos. Por ejemplo, para iterar una colección de cadenas que representan nombres, podemos escribir for(String name: names){}. En segundo plano, él foreach se convierte, a nivel de código de bytes, para utilizar un Iterator, mientras que el iterator nos dice que hay un elemento, busca el siguiente elemento para procesarlo.

A well-structured logging system helps developers understand how an application is running, identify issues, and optimize performance.
Why Are Logs Important?


Logs serve several critical purposes, including:
Debugging &amp; Troubleshooting: Logs help track down issues, especially in production environments where debugging directly is not feasible.
Monitoring &amp; Observability: Logs allow teams to monitor application health and detect anomalies.
Security Auditing: Logs keep records of critical events, such as user authentication attempts and database queries, which are essential for security audits.

I have lived through five versions of HTML (2,3,4,XHTML,5) and watched as libraries like jQuery and frameworks like Angular have come and gone from the spotlight. And I&#x27;m here now to tell you that you never NEEDED any of them and this has never been more true than it is today.
Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, HTML Templates. These tools provide everything we need to build robust, modern apps without relying on heavy abstractions. But still, in 2025, the web development world clings tightly to libraries like React.

                              <span>database server is a server which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers, as defined by the client–server model.[citation needed][1][2] Database management systems (DBMSs) frequently provide database-server functionality, and some database management systems (such as MySQL) rely exclusively on the client–server model for database access (while others, like SQLite, are meant for use as an embedded database).
Users access a database server either through a &quot;front end&quot; running on the user&#x27;s computer – which displays requested data – or through the &quot;back end&quot;, which runs on the server and handles tasks such as data analysis and storage.
In a master–slave model, database master servers are central and primary locations of data while database slave servers are synchronized backups of the master acting as proxies.
Most database applications respond to a query language. Each database understands its query language and converts each submitted query to server-readable form and executes it to retrieve results.
Examples of proprietary database applications include Oracle, IBM Db2, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server. Examples of free software database applications include PostgreSQL; and under the GNU General Public Licence include Ingres and MySQL. Every server uses its own query logic and structure. The SQL (Structured Query Language) query language is more or less the same on all relational database applications.
For clarification, a database server is simply a server that maintains services related to clients via database applications.

At first glance, AWS Config and Kubernetes-native policy engines like OPA Gatekeeper and Kyverno may appear to serve the same function — enforcing rules and ensuring compliance in containerized workloads. But in reality, they operate at different layers, solve distinct problems, and target different scopes of governance.

                              <span>A data mart is a structure/access pattern specific to data warehouse environments. The data mart is a subset of the data warehouse that focuses on a specific business line, department, subject area, or team.[1] Whereas data warehouses have an enterprise-wide depth, the information in data marts pertains to a single department. In some deployments, each department or business unit is considered the owner of its data mart, including all the hardware, software, and data.[2] This enables each department to isolate the use, manipulation, and development of their data. In other deployments where conformed dimensions are used, this business unit ownership will not hold true for shared dimensions like customer, product, etc. 
Warehouses and data marts are built because the information in the datab…</span>

LoRA makes fine-tuning efficient by tweaking only a small subset of parameters, perfect for those of us working with limited hardware.

                              <span>In recent years, the notion that “big data is dying” seems to be gaining traction. Some say the big data craze has faded, while others lament the shrinking job opportunities, the increasing complexity of platforms, and the growing intricacy of business demands. But does this really mean big data is dying?
I don’t think so. In my view, what’s truly dying is not big data itself, but rather the outdated “dragon-slaying techniques” that no longer have any “dragons” to slay. The “dragon” has evolved, while our weapons remain stuck in the past. Technology needs to evolve, architectures need to be restructured, and capabilities need to be upgraded.
To understand the current state and trends of big data, we must first examine how it has evolved step by step. The development of big data can be divi…</span>

Oye, backend ke sher! 🦁 2025 mein jab log AI, Web3, aur naya naya tech ke piche bhaag rahe hain, ek language chupke se backend ka sartaaj bana hua hai—Java. Haan, wahi Java jisko tumne college mein “public static void main” se shuru kiya aur socha, “Yeh toh old school hai.” Bhai, yeh old school nahi, gold school hai! Netflix, Amazon, aur woh banking apps jo crores ke transactions sambhalte hain—sab Java ke fan hain. Kyun? Kyunki Java stability ka baap hai, scalability ka dost, aur ecosystem ka multiverse. Chalo, wittedtech style mein iska raaz kholte hain—thodi masti, thodi kahani, aur dher saara gyaan. Ready ho? Let’s code this up!

                              <span>When you&#x27;re building a dynamic frontend—like a game store, product listing, or job board—your UI needs to handle a lot of state:
What page are we on?
What filters are selected?
Are we sorting by newest, most relevant, or trending?
What platform, genre, or tags are selected?
Managing all of that with separate useState hooks or deeply nested props can quickly become a nightmare. Enter the Query Object Pattern.
A Query Object is a single JavaScript object that encapsulates all your query parameters—filter values, sort order, pagination, etc.
const [query, setQuery] &#x3D; useState({
  genreId: null,
  platformId: null,
  sortOrder: &#x27;relevance&#x27;,
  searchText: &#x27;&#x27;,
  page: 1,
});

Instead of spreading your state across multiple hooks:

                              <span>When learning programming or data structures, it’s easy to feel like we&#x27;re making significant progress just by spending a lot of time coding or watching tutorials. We might think that by solving numerous problems or watching endless videos, we are improving our skills. However, after a certain point, we might find ourselves struggling to solve problems we’ve encountered before or feel stuck when faced with new challenges. This is the false sense of progress that many learners experience in their programming journey.
At the beginning of learning programming, it’s common to feel like we are advancing rapidly. Solving coding problems and watching tutorials can give us the impression that we&#x27;re progressing. But when it comes to solving more complex problems or applying what we&#x27;ve learned to re…</span>

                              <span>Limitations of Virtual Machines and Servers?


1. Startup &amp; Shutdown Times:
VMs generally take longer to start up and shut down compared to containers, which can impact the speed of deployment and scaling.
This delay can be a bottleneck in environments requiring rapid provisioning and de-provisioning of resources.
2. Dynamic Resource Allocation is Complex:
VMs rely on hypervisors(such as VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V) to manage and allocate resources like CPU, memory and storage. This adds complexity because the hypervisor needs to handle various resource demands and ensure fare distribution. (Earlier we would need to Shutdown the VM for changing the allocated resources but now this can be done on a running instance as well but it still needs input/human intervention and its complex)

                              <span>message queues or event streaming platforms play a critical role in enabling this communication.
But here&#x27;s the key question:
How reliably is a message delivered from sender to receiver?
Let’s break down the three core delivery semantics you’ll encounter in real-world systems 👇
At-Most Once


🔹 Messages are delivered zero or one time
No retries, so if something fails — the message is lost
no guarantee of delivery
💡 Use case: Monitoring metrics, logs, or telemetry where occasional loss is acceptable.
At-Least Once


🔹 Messages are never lost
may be delivered multiple times
deduplicate on the consumer side
💡 Use case: Order processing, notifications, analytics — where duplicates can be filtered or ignored.
Exactly Once


🔹 Each message is delivered only once, no duplicates, no loss
very hard to implement
complexity, latency, and often performance trade-offs
💡 Use case: Financial transactions, trading systems, accounting — where idempotency is not supported and every operation must be precise.
Choosing the right delivery guarantee isn’t just about tech — it’s about your use case and business priorities.
a single duplicate message could cost thousands.
📌 Message Queue vs Event Streaming Platform?
🔹 Message Queues (like RabbitMQ, SQS): Focus on reliability and order for point-to-point communication.
🔹 Event Streaming Platforms (like Kafka, Pulsar): Optimized for broadcasting, storing, and replaying high-throughput event logs. Ideal for event-driven systems and real-time analytics.
What’s your go-to strategy for delivery semantics in distributed systems?

                              <span>Let’s be honest. You&#x27;ve spent hours wrangling with bloated WordPress themes or waiting on backend fixes just to launch a simple page. Sound familiar?
It’s not you. It’s the traditional CMS model.
Let’s talk about why headless CMS is the quiet hero that’s helping frontend developers like you build faster and smarter.
What Is a Headless CMS (And Why Should You Care)?


In dev-speak: it’s a CMS without a front-end layer.
In real talk: it gives you content via API and lets you build the frontend however you want.
So instead of battling clunky plugins and rigid templates, you’re free to code with your favorite stack — React, Next.js, Vue, whatever.
1. Speed Boost with Modern Dev Tools


Headless CMS platforms are made to play well with modern JavaScript. You can:
Pull content via REST or GraphQL
Use static site generators like Next.js for blazing performance
Integrate easily with CI/CD workflows
Translation? You ship faster — and with less backend drama.
2. Frontend Freedom &#x3D; Faster Iteration


No more begging backend devs to make a template change.
With headless, you’re in full control of the UI/UX. Want to test a new layout or animation? Go for it. Your content comes clean and structured — so you can design and iterate freely.
## 3. Better Dev-Content Team Workflow
They update copy. You build features. No blockers.
4. Scale Without Slowing Down


Need to serve content across web, mobile, and IoT? No problem.
You can scale globally, without rebuilding everything from scratch.
Final Thought: Headless Is Built for How Developers Actually Work
If you’re tired of waiting on legacy systems and want a faster, cleaner development experience, it might be time to switch.

Let me be honest SQL has been giving me a hard time for a while. So, I was getting stuck even with the basics. So I decided to stop running away and build a real project from scratch: a student enrollment system. 
I wanted something simple but useful, where I could understand how real systems are built with SQL,,including relationships, foreign keys, and triggers. This is how it went down.
This project is all about managing a small school system. It handles:
Storing student info (name, email, date of birth)
Keeping track of instructors
Linking courses to instructors
Enrolling students to courses
Logging every enrollment using a trigger

Next.js - Image Component
Importing images used the &#x27;import&#x27; keyword for the image &#x27;src&#x27; breaks jest test #26749
Jest - Manual Mocks
React Testing Library
MDN JavaScript - Rest parameters
When testing a React component with Jest and the React Testing Library, this error occurs if the component renders a Next.js Image component and the Next.js Image component is not mocked.
Error: Uncaught [Error: Image with src &quot;test-file-stub&quot; is missing required &quot;width&quot; property.]

To allow passing dynamic properties into the mock image component so that it can handle different test cases, modify the mock image to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
In jest/setup.js, add the following:
jest.mock(&#x27;next/image&#x27;, () &#x3D;&gt; ({
  __esModule: true,
  default: (props) &#x3D;&gt; {
    return ;
  },
}));

For example,
const renderResult &#x3D; render();
container &#x3D; renderResult.container;
console.debug(container.innerHTML);

This will output the following in the terminal:

One group can have many users
1) Generate user and post
go run -mod&#x3D;mod entgo.io/ent/cmd/ent new User
go run -mod&#x3D;mod entgo.io/ent/cmd/ent new Group

2) Connect user with group
func (User) Edges() []ent.Edge {

    return []ent.Edge{
        edge.From(&quot;users&quot;, User.Type).Ref(&quot;groups&quot;),
    }
}

4) Try to create user and groups
func CreateUser(client *ent.Client, ctx context.Context) {
    // Create groups
    g1, _ :&#x3D; client.Group.Create().SetName(&quot;Group 1&quot;).Save(ctx)

Creating PowerPoint presentations programmatically can streamline many tasks, but running into errors that impact your ability to open the formatted file can be frustrating. If you&#x27;ve been trying to create a .ppt file using Apache POI version 4.1.2 and encountered the error &quot;PowerPoint found a problem with content in file.ppt&quot;, you&#x27;re not alone. This issue, while not present during your work with previous versions like poi-3.17, indicates that there might be changes or compatibility issues in the newer version that we must address.
Why Does the Error Occur?
The error you’re experiencing typically arises due to changes in library behavior, certain configurations, or the way the Apache POI library handles PowerPoint file structures between versions. Potential issues could includ…</span>

                              <span>As AI agents move from prototypes to production, one of the most important — and most overlooked — aspects of working with them is how to test and evaluate their different behaviors.
Developers are constantly tweaking prompts, adjusting tools, or changing logic. QA engineers are tasked with verifying that responses are accurate, relevant, and aligned with product expectations. Yet, most teams lack a structured way to experiment, compare, and improve AI agents across different versions.
This guide outlines the core challenges and introduces a solution based on isolating agent versions, logging structured evaluations, and making experimentation reproducible and measurable.
AI agents&#x27;behavior changes based on:
Prompt instructions
Tool availability
Model versions
System context or user inputs

 Don’t let yours be the next headline.
The NTT Communications breach showed us what happens when user permissions and privileges are mismanaged. Attackers exploited weak access control and exposed sensitive data from over 18,000 organizations.
Here’s how it should have been done: secure onboarding, least privilege, and strict access control using real-world Linux best practices.

Virtual DOM and selective updates
What is the Virtual DOM?
Diffing Algorithm 🔄
Selective Updates
// Conceptual illustration—React does something like:
const prevVDOM &#x3D; renderApp(props);
const nextVDOM &#x3D; renderApp(newProps);
const patches &#x3D; diff(prevVDOM, nextVDOM);
applyPatchesToDOM(patches);

Keys 🔑
// ❌ Bad: key&#x3D;{index}

  {items.map((item, index) &#x3D;&gt; (
    
{item.name}
 (
    
{item.name}
  ))}


Rendering 500+ rows at once kills performance. Virtualization renders only the visible portion of a list.Tools …</span>

                              <span>The landscape of frontend development is constantly evolving, especially when it comes to UI components. For years, we&#x27;ve juggled comprehensive libraries like Material UI, Ant Design, or Chakra UI. They offer a wealth of pre-built components, but often come with trade-offs: heavy bundle sizes, complex style overrides, and a feeling of being locked into their specific ecosystem and design opinions. Then came Shadcn/ui, and for many developers like myself, it fundamentally changed the game.

Shadcn/ui isn&#x27;t a component library in the traditional sense. It&#x27;s better described as a curated collection of beautifully designed, highly reusable UI primitives and components built using Radix UI for behaviour and accessibility, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The magic lies in its approach: you don&#x27;t i…</span>

Yeah, this post took a while to come out—writing consistently is still a challenge for me. But hey, I&#x27;m trying to stay on track and keep this blog alive for the months ahead.
In this post, I’ll walk you through what I’ve been building lately. Lots of progress, especially on the frontend, but also a good amount of refactoring under the hood.
If this is your first time hearing about Fidely, I recommend checking out the series to understand the context and the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve.
Right now, I’m mostly focused on the shop owner’s point of view.
Here’s what a shop owner can now do:
✅ Register/Login

✅ Create and manage one or more companies

✅ Set up loyalty campaigns (both points collection and stamps)

✅ Create customer cards

                              <span>Hello Dev.to community! 👋
As a developer, I often found myself repeating the same Git commands over and over again during my workflow...

So I built a small CLI tool called gitNull to make that easier!
gitNull?


A lightweight GitFlow helper written in Node.js.

It automates common git actions like:
gitNull start-feature 
gitNull finish-feature 
gitNull push – adds, commits and pushes in one command
With a retro CLI look and some colorful feedback thanks to chalk and figlet.
I love clean workflows, and I always wished Git had something a bit more guided.

I didn’t want a full GUI — just a faster terminal flow.
This is my first attempt at building a CLI tool, and I&#x27;m sharing it to get feedback and ideas from the community.

Check it out on GitHub:

https://github.com/faithreborn/gitnull
Whether you&#x27;re a CLI junkie, a GitFlow user, or someone who just hates typing long commands —

I’d really appreciate if you give it a try and tell me what you think. ❤️
Any feedback, issues or PRs are welcome!
Thanks for reading 🙌</span>

                              <span>Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Studio Code, commonly just called VS Code, is a great piece of software. This is in no small part due to all extensions on the extensive marketplace providing extreme flexibility. It has proven it to be adaptable to most, if not all, software development projects.
My editor of choice, neovim, provides no such benefits out of the box, requiring me to configure everything, install language plugins, code completion, myself. 
Vim and neovim are by far more powerful editors, but lacking the ease-of-use of VSCode, and easy discoverability of new features; I don&#x27;t recommend beginners to use these. Configuration is done through code, not a nice UI allowing you to browse a marketplace and take popularity into consideration when choosing between different plugins for the same task…</span>

Let’s start with the basics. We’ll define our first entity, which is essentially just a SQL table. In it, we need to specify the field names and their types. The first entity will be called event. It will store all the core info about each event: the account of the user who created it, the question text, creation time, expiration time, a flag that shows whether the event is closed, and the result. I want to directly link each event to its creator’s account. For that, we’ll use the type ft4 account, which represents a user in the FT4 system.

                              <span>When using gRPC, one of its biggest advantages over traditional REST is the use of a single long-lived connection over HTTP/2.
What does that mean?


Unlike REST where every request opens a new connection, gRPC establishes one persistent connection between the client and the server. Through this connection, multiple messages can be exchanged — in both directions — without reopening it each time.
Think of it like this:


Imagine going to a restaurant. With REST, you’d have to enter and exit the restaurant every time you wanted to order something new. But with gRPC, you sit down once, and continue to place multiple orders and have conversations — all through that single session.
Benefits of gRPC’s Long-Lived Connection:



✅ Reduced latency
✅ Real-time communication
✅ Efficient use of resources
✅ Bidirectional streaming supported
Use Cases:


Perfect for real-time apps like online games, chat systems, IoT devices, and microservice communications — where speed and efficiency matter most.</span>

                              <span>Introduction 
The concept of sequence modeling is fundamental to understanding RNNs. Many real-world problems involve sequences, where the order of elements carries significant meaning. For example, in language, the meaning of a sentence depends heavily on the order of the words. Similarly, in video analysis, the sequence of frames determines the action being performed. RNNs excel at capturing these dependencies, making them a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. The application of RNNs is prevalent in the field of deep learning. 
The history of RNNs is marked by continuous evolution. Early RNN architectures faced challenges like the vanishing gradient problem, which hindered their ability to learn long-range dependencies. However, innovations like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) …</span>

This amazing idea is becoming real through something called synesthetic data interfaces. That’s a big name, but it simply means using your senses—like hearing, sight, or touch—to understand data. It’s like turning code or information into a song, a rainbow, or even a feeling in your hand.
Why is this important? Because everyone learns differently. Some people understand pictures better, while others learn better by hearing or touching things. Synesthetic data interfaces help people understand hard things in their own way. And guess what? It’s not just for learning. These tools can help doctors, scientists, game designers, and even artists see their work in a brand-new light.

                              <span>What is Data Scraping?
Data scraping (or web scraping) refers to the process of automatically extracting data from websites or other online sources. The purpose is to gather structured data from unstructured sources, like web pages, and transform it into a more usable format for analysis or other purposes. Web scraping usually involves retrieving information from HTML or web APIs and processing it to fit specific needs.
Unlike manual methods, data scraping uses automated techniques to extract data at scale, making it faster and more efficient. The extracted data is often saved in formats like CSV, JSON, or databases for easy analysis and usage.

I’m diving headfirst into the world of web development – but not just the usual buttons and forms. I’m aiming to craft interactive 3D experiences using JavaScript + Three.js, blending logic with visual magic.
I started with console.log(&quot;Hello World&quot;), and now I’m obsessed with rendering rotating cubes, glowing lights, and dream-like virtual spaces. My mission?

To go from beginner to full-stack 3D dev — building apps that feel like games and flow like dreams.
Each week, I’ll post small builds, weird bugs, cool fixes, and what I’m learning.

If you love creative code, 3D illusions, or are on your own dev journey — follow along, let’s grow together.
Let’s code the future, one pixel at a time.

The issue, first identified on April 16, could have enabled an attacker to mint unauthorized tokens and withdraw them from user accounts. 
Although the vulnerability was patched without evidence of active exploitation, the method of resolution raised renewed scrutiny over the centralization of communication within Solana’s validator ecosystem.
The flaw was located in two key programs used within the Solana ecosystem:

Laravel provides a robust validation system, but sometimes you may need to define custom validation rules to handle specific use cases. With Laravel 12, the process of creating custom validation rules has been streamlined with improved syntax and features.
In this article, we’ll explore how to create and use custom validation rules in Laravel 12.
While Laravel’s built-in validation rules cover most scenarios, there are cases where you need more flexibility. For example:
Validating a username to ensure it doesn’t contain special characters. 
Checking if a value exists in an external API.
Enforcing complex business logic.
Custom validation rules allow you to encapsulate this logic in a reusable and testable way.
In Laravel 12, you can create a custom …</span>

  Introdução


Considero que buscar entender os mecanismos que afetam nossa eficiência é muito importante. Um desses mecanismos é a Lei de Parkinson, uma força invisível mas constante que atua sobre nossas atividades diárias. Neste post, vamos explorar o que é essa força, como ela afeta nosso dia a dia e, principalmente, como podemos combatê-la para sermos mais eficientes.
A Lei de Parkinson foi originalmente proposta por Northcote Parkinson em 1955. Em seu estudo original, ele observou que em instituições públicas, como a marinha, o número de funcionários aumentava constantemente, mesmo quando o volume d…</span>

                              <span>When working with visualizations like bar charts in ECharts, it&#x27;s common to face issues where some data points become invisible when zoomed in. Users often want their entire dataset to be visible, irrespective of the current zoom level. In this article, we will explore how to ensure all data points in your ECharts bar chart remain visible, even under various zoom settings.
Understanding ECharts and Zooming
ECharts is a powerful open-source charting library that enables developers to create interactive charts effortlessly. Bar charts (like the one in your example) are especially useful for comparing different categories of data. However, when zooming in on a chart, some data points can fall outside of the visible area due to the scaling of the axes or the chart dimension limitations.

Jump right to Too Long, Didn&#x27;t Read section.
The main usage of @puya/fh is helping in syncing content of a folder based on its differences with another folder, no matter where they are located (same machine or different machines).
The tool does not perform the sync job itself when the two folders are located in separate machines. It provides features though that helps in creating a changeset out of the changes.
The next step (transferring and extracting the changeset onto target folder) is easy - can be performed manually or by any automation tool or script.

                              <span>Trust matters when browsing websites, but how can you be sure you&#x27;re on the real deal? The answer lies in a Certificate Chain of Trust that checks website identities with SSL/TLS. This chain of digital certificates connects users to websites through verification steps.

At the top of the chain is the Root Certificate. This is issued by a Root Certificate Authority (CA). These root certificates are pre-installed and trusted by operating systems and browsers. Since they are self-signed, they serve as the anchor of trust for the entire chain.
Next in line is the Intermediate Certificate, which acts as a bridge between the root and the final certificate. The root certificate signs the intermediate, and the intermedia…</span>

В этом руководстве мы разберём ключевые принципы SEO-оптимизации для WordPress, которые должен знать каждый начинающий разработчик.
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) — это комплекс мер по улучшению видимости сайта в поисковых системах (Google, Яндекс и др.). Для WordPress SEO особенно актуально, так как:
WordPress — SEO-дружественная платформа, но требует правильной настройки
Более 40% сайтов в интернете работают на WP — конкуренция высока

The home page loaded fine, but when I tried to open any story, I got stuck on an endless loading screen.
At first, I thought it was temporary maintenance. But after a week of the same issue, I knew something else was wrong. I did some digging on Reddit and found a pattern:
Only Jio users in India were having this problem 🇮🇳
The Wattpad home screen would load, but stories wouldn&#x27;t
People using other networks like Airtel had no issues
I tested this by connecting to my Airtel hotspot instead of my Jio data, and suddenly Wattpad worked perfectly! That confirmed the issue was specific to Jio&#x27;s network.

When working with Angular applications, encountering errors can often perplex even the most seasoned developers. One common error is the TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading &#x27;offsetHeight&#x27;). This blog post will address what causes this error and how you can resolve it seamlessly.
Understanding the Error
The error in question occurs when you attempt to access a property of an object that is null. In the context of your Angular application, this is often related to scenarios where components or services have not initialized correctly or are not available during the lifecycle of the application. Specifically, in your case, it happens when the MenuModule from PrimeNG tries to perform layout calculations on a menu element that hasn&#x27;t been fully rendered yet.

This article explores RBAC and LBAC in Grafana, highlighting real-world best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and actionable insights to scale efficiently.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns permissions based on defined roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), controlling user actions like dashboard creation or data source management. RBAC excels in simplicity, making it ideal for straightforward access needs in small, single-tenant setups.
Pros:
Easy to implement
Well-understood by engineers
Cons:
Quickly becomes unmanageable at scale
Limited granularity, causing &quot;role explosion&quot; in complex scenarios
LBAC enhances access control by dynamically filtering data based on labels or attributes at query-time, rather than just static user roles. Grafana recently introd…</span>

Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker that facilitates reliable communication between applications and services, both in the cloud and hybrid environments. It supports message queues (point-to-point communication) and publish-subscribe topics (fan-out to multiple consumers), making it ideal for decoupling distributed systems. Brighter provides first-class integration with Azure Service Bus via the Paramore.Brighter.MessagingGateway.AzureServiceBus package, enabling seamless command/event routing in .NET applications.

You run your tests once — they pass. Run them again — they fail. Maybe the third-party API timed out. Or the response changed. Or your internet blinked. Integration tests should give you confidence, not stress.
That’s where deterministic integration testing comes in. Imagine recording your API interactions once and replaying them forever — offline, fast, and predictable.
No network. No surprises.
That’s exactly what Vcr.HttpRecorder does.
It’s inspired by the original Ruby VCR gem, revived for .NET and brought back to life with new features and bug fixes in my fork.

In traditional integration tests, you call real services — maybe a payment gateway, an external API, or even another microservice. But real services are unpredictable:

When you write Python code, you use symbols to separate, group, or define parts of the program. These symbols are called delimiters. A delimiter does not perform an action like an operator. Instead, it marks structure and boundaries.
In writing, you use punctuation to make ideas clear. A comma breaks up items. A period ends a sentence. In Python, delimiters help the interpreter make sense of what comes next.
Python uses delimiters to shape the structure of your code.
(1 + 2) * 3

{&quot;key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}

def f(): pass

You use delimiters to build lists, assign values, pass arguments, and group code. Python requires these markers so it can read your program correctly.

                              <span>Splitting strings is crucial for effective text management in PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL offers built-in functions designed to handle string splits elegantly, whether you need arrays for flexible querying or rows for easy data normalization.
Precisely extracts substrings from structured text.
SELECT SPLIT_PART(&#x27;2025-12-25&#x27;, &#x27;-&#x27;, 3); -- &#x27;25&#x27;

Creates arrays from strings for easier data manipulation.
SELECT STRING_TO_ARRAY(&#x27;apple,banana,grape&#x27;, &#x27;,&#x27;);
-- {&#x27;apple&#x27;,&#x27;banana&#x27;,&#x27;grape&#x27;}

Turns delimited strings into rows, simplifying relational data operations.
SELECT STRING_TO_TABLE(&#x27;NY|LA|SF&#x27;, &#x27;|&#x27;);
-- Rows: NY, LA, SF

Splits strings flexibly using regex.
SELECT REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_ARRAY(&#x27;SKU123-ColorBlue&#x27;, &#x27;\W+|\D+&#x27;);
-- {&#x27;123&#x27;,&#x27;Blue&#x27;}

Transforms strings into rows for detailed analysis.
SELECT REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_TABLE(&#x27;Dev.to PostgreSQL guide&#x27;, &#x27;\s+&#x27;);
-- Rows: Dev.to, PostgreSQL, guide

This is a submission for the Permit.io Authorization Challenge: Permissions Redefined
GitGuard is a full-stack, production-grade access control and auditing system designed specifically for modern development teams managing sensitive GitHub repositories. It addresses a critical pain point: how to provide fine-grained, secure, and temporary access to GitHub repos — without over-permissioning or sacrificing agility.
Think of GitGuard as a “Just-in-Time IAM layer” tailored for GitHub operations. Whether you&#x27;re a growing startup or a security-conscious enterprise, GitGuard gives you the tools to go beyond GitHub’s default permission model.
Users must validate identity via FaceID/Fingerprint before critical access is granted.

                              <span>State management is a critical part of building modern front-end applications. If you&#x27;ve worked with Vue 2, you may be familiar with Vuex. But with Vue 3, a new, simpler alternative has emerged: Pinia.
In this article, you’ll learn how to use Pinia to manage application state in a Vue 3 project — from installation to real-world usage.
Enjoy!
Pinia is the official state management library for Vue 3. It’s lightweight, modular, and built with the Composition API in mind. Compared to Vuex, it offers a simpler syntax, better TypeScript support, and out-of-the-box devtools integration.
Benefits of using Pinia:
Simpler syntax compared to Vuex
First-class support for the Composition API
Built-in devtools and TypeScript support
Modular design (define as many small stores as needed)

Whether you&#x27;re just starting or managing clusters in production, you&#x27;re bound to hit issues. Here&#x27;s a list of the top 10 Kubernetes problems developers and DevOps engineers run into—and how to fix them fast.
⚠️ 1. Pods Stuck in CrashLoopBackOff
💥 Problem: Pod starts → crashes → Kubernetes tries again → repeat.
🛠️ Troubleshoot:



Check logs for stack traces or config errors. Use livenessProbe and readinessProbe wisely.
🚫 2. ImagePullBackOff or ErrImagePull
💥 Problem: Kubernetes can’t pull the container image.
🛠️ Troubleshoot:
Double-check the image path (e.g., myrepo/myapp:latest)
📡 3. Services Not Exposing Pods
💥 Problem: You’ve deployed your app, but it’s unreachable.

I built a Web3-based CMS (Content Management System) designed for managing decentralized content like collections, banners, presale campaigns, and other on-chain/off-chain data. The CMS provides an admin dashboard where team members can log in using their crypto wallets and manage the platform’s content in a more structured and user-friendly way.
The key problem it solves is the lack of permission control in many Web3 tools. Typically, dApps allow wallet login but don’t differentiate between users. In my CMS, I introduced fine-grained access control so that different roles (e.g., admin, content editor, viewer/analyst) have access only to the features relevant to them.

                              <span>Whether you&#x27;re building a side project, open source library, or internal tool, developer documentation helps others understand, use, and contribute to your work. The good news? You don’t need to be an expert to write it.
In fact, some of the best docs are written by beginners because they know exactly what’s confusing at first.
This guide explains how anyone can write great dev docs and what to focus on, step by step.
Think of documentation as the user manual for your code. Without it, other developers have to guess how things work.
Good docs:
Save people time (including future-you).
Reduce questions and support issues.
Encourage others to use or contribute to your project.
Make your work look professional and trustworthy.

Anyone who understands the project can write documentation.

In 2025, it’s a core digital strategy driving SEO, lead generation, brand awareness, and even revenue. Yet, despite its importance, 90% of blog posts get little to no traffic (Ahrefs), primarily because beginner bloggers unknowingly fall into avoidable traps.
Whether you&#x27;re a solo founder, a content marketer, or a startup trying to grow organically, avoiding these common mistakes is essential. Fortunately, tools like Bloggr.AI are changing the game — not by replacing human creativity but by enhancing it.
Let’s explore five critical blogging mistakes beginners make and how Bloggr.AI offers a smart, AI-powered solution to each.

Are you facing issues with generating a valid signature while trying to obtain an access token from the Tuya API using Arduino C++? If you’re encountering a &#x27;sign invalid&#x27; error, you’re not alone. This guide explores the common pitfalls during the signature generation process and how to troubleshoot them effectively.
Understanding the Tuya API Authentication Process
In order to interact with the Tuya IoT platform, every request you make, including obtaining an access token, requires a valid HMAC-SHA256 signature. The signature is created using your client ID, client secret, and a timestamp. A miscalculation, incorrect data types, or even timing issues can lead to the &#x27;sign invalid&#x27; error.
Common Reasons for &#x27;Sign Invalid&#x27;
Incorrect Timestamp: Make sure the timestamp you&#x27;re gen…</span>

Capturing a moving car’s ID number is challenging for the human eye, but this project makes it possible. The number plate detection system using the ESP32-CAM, programmed via the Arduino IDE, captures an image of a vehicle’s number plate and sends it to a cloud server through an HTTP POST request over Wi-Fi. The server performs OCR to extract the plate number and returns the result in JSON …</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;re looking to categorize a list of names in a CSV file efficiently, you&#x27;re not alone. Many developers find themselves in a situation where they need to assign classifications to items in a large dataset based on certain criteria. In this article, we will explore a straightforward way to replace names with their corresponding categories, such as &#x27;Soccer player&#x27;, &#x27;MMA fighter&#x27;, &#x27;NBA player&#x27;, and &#x27;NFL player&#x27;, using Python.
Understanding the Problem
In our example, we have a CSV file containing various names representing athletes from different sports. Our objective is to replace those names with predefined categories without having to manually assign each one. This approach not only saves time but also reduces the likelihood of errors that might occur with manual data entry.

Hi all.
I recently rebuilt my personal site using 11ty, and I wanted to share a bit about why I chose simplicity over flashy design.
Like many developers, I started with a more complex stack — Astro, React, lots of moving parts. It looked cool, but it started to feel like I was building for the tools instead of myself.
So I started over with 11ty. It’s fast, flexible, and just lets me focus on content. Tbh I hate npm, and with 11ty i like that there&#x27;s no bundlers, no frameworks. Just clean HTML, Markdown, and a bit of templating.
The site is still a work in progress, but I like how it feels now — more personal, less performative. It’s a place for my notes, thoughts, and projects. Nothing fancy. Just mine.
Would love any feedback or thoughts — especially from others who’ve simplified their stacks or gone the “digital garden” route.
Thanks for reading!</span>

And I wonder how many do you use, let me take a guess that in 90% of apps you only use the below 10 (modern or classic):
label
button
input
combobox
datepicker
vertical gallery
image
icon
form
container
If you read this in a year we all know Copilot will be on the list too
So I wanted to talk about 6 really cool components you should be using more often.
Call out Im cheating, some are single components, some are groups, so it&#x27;s not really 6 😎
HTML
Timer
Charts
Map
Add Picture

                              <span>Authentication is at the heart of every secure web application. As frontend developers, understanding modern authentication flows and how to implement them securely is crucial. This article explores the most widely used authentication methods today: OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and OpenID Connect, and introduces some emerging approaches.
Authentication determines who the user is, and authorization determines what they can access. An insecure authentication mechanism can expose your app to session hijacking, data leaks, and impersonation attacks.
Modern SPAs (Single Page Applications) demand decoupled and secure authentication techniques that work well across multiple clients, including web, mobile, and APIs.
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework, not an authentication protocol by it…</span>

I hate seeing &quot;passionate&quot; listed as a requirement in job postings.
How can we measure passion? Is there a quiz, like those magazine questionnaires? &quot;Find out if you&#x27;re a passionate coder in less than 5 minutes with 10 easy-to-answer questions.&quot;
The best coders I&#x27;ve met at past jobs weren&#x27;t what we&#x27;d call passionate.
By passionate, I mean making open source contributions, speaking at conferences, and writing posts. They were busy enough making money.
The other day, Miguel, one of my email subscribers, shared a similar experience. Here&#x27;s an excerpt of his email:
Personally, I&#x27;ve become discouraged in my programming career and no longer aspire to work at one of the most important tech companies. I just want to pay my bills and meet my family&#x27;s needs.…</span>

But no matter how hard I tried, I kept building in the background: automation scripts, app ideas, systems.
Then it hit me:

So I returned to tech, stronger than before.

Now I build learning tools, solve hiring problems using AI, and mentor others on the same path.

In the ever-evolving world of technology, programming languages serve as the building blocks for software development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Among these, the Python programming language has emerged as one of the most popular and versatile tools for developers, scientists, educators, and businesses alike. Known for its readability, simplicity, and power, Python has revolutionized the way we approach programming by making it more accessible and efficient across various domains.
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. The primary philosophy behind Python emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it ideal for both beginners and experienced developers. Its…</span>

If you&#x27;re developing a Tauri app and want to customize the hover text that appears when your application is minimized to the dock, you&#x27;re in the right place! The hover text, also known as the tooltip, often defaults to the app name specified in your configuration file. In this guide, we&#x27;ll explore how to change the hover text to reflect your specific preferences, such as setting it to &#x27;Pepper&#x27;, the name of your app.
Why Hover Text Matters
Hover text or tooltips provide users with quick information about what an application does. In the context of a Tauri app on the dock, having clear and informative hover text can improve user experience and provide clarity regarding the app’s purpose. It eliminates ambiguity, especially for apps with similar names or purposes.

                              <span>For years, JavaScript has powered the modern web—but what if you could take things to a whole new level of performance? Imagine bringing near-native execution speed right into your browser, opening doors to gaming, video editing, simulations, and even machine learning—all running seamlessly inside your web app.
Welcome to the world of WebAssembly (Wasm)—a game-changer for frontend and backend developers alike.

WebAssembly is a binary instruction format designed to run at near-native speed in web browsers. It&#x27;s language-agnostic, meaning you can write code in C, C++, Rust, Go, and other languages, then compile it to Wasm and run it alongside JavaScript.
Key advantages of WebAssembly:
🚀 Blazing-fast performance — thanks to low-level, optimized bytecode

Frontend: lovable,  tsx, React 


Backend: Node.js + Express proxy


Permit PDP: Docker container (works great locally, not separately hosted… details below)


Permit Cloud: For managing roles, resources, and policies







  
  
  🎯 The Goal


It&#x27;s gotta be obvious that it works.
So I made a proxy server, because API keys. 
Is that the correct decision? ask me later. currently it probably isn&#x27;t hosted, but what definitely isn&#x27;t:
PDP (Policy Decision Point) runs locally in Docker — lovable didn&#x27;t work with this the first time I tried, but at least it works on my machine

                              <span>Introduction
When working with SQL, especially with outer joins, it&#x27;s crucial to understand how to filter your results effectively. In your case, you&#x27;re looking to perform a right outer join between two tables and then conditionally include or exclude rows based on the status from one of these tables. This article will break down how to efficiently filter results using outer joins in SQL while ensuring you get data according to specific conditions.
Understanding the Outer Join Behavior
Outer joins, particularly the right outer join you mentioned, are designed to include all the entries from the right table (in this case, table2), along with matching rows from the left table (table1). If there are no matches, SQL will return NULL for columns from table1. This behavior poses a challenge when…</span>

                              <span>Optimization algorithms are the unsung heroes behind many computational tasks, from training machine learning models to solving engineering problems. A recent paper, A Comparative Analysis of Optimization Algorithms: The Himmelblau Function Case Study (April 22, 2025), dives into how four algorithms tackle the Himmelblau function, a tricky test problem with multiple solutions. This article distills the study’s core findings for developers, keeping the technical details intact but simple and math-free.
What’s the Himmelblau Function?
The Himmelblau function is a benchmark problem used to test optimization algorithms. It’s like a hilly landscape with four identical “valleys” (global minima) where the best solutions lie, plus some deceptive “shallow dips” (local minima) that can trap algorith…</span>

I recently finished a fun little C++ project that simulates a butterfly flying around your desktop — but with a twist: it does so in a controlled environment for custom text input! Remember the DVD logo that people love when  it touches the corner based on a fixed path, this one is unpredictable as its movement is random.

Give it a try by downloading the Github Release: Hover_Bug
Spawns a entered text that &quot;hovers&quot; on top of all windows.
Almost like a DVD logo that people love when it touches the corner.
Runs seamlessly on Windows — think of it like a lightweight desktop companion.
Language: C++
Framework: Win32 API for desktop-level rendering and layering

Why Linux Security Matters


The Power of Permissions


User Management: Only the Right People Get In


Updates and Patching: Stay Ahead of Threats


Firewalls and Network Safety


Real-Life Example: Locking Down a Shared Server


Bonus Tips: Extra Layers of Protection


Wrapping Up






Let’s face it: no system is invincible. 
Linux security is all about keeping your system safe from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats-using smart design, open-source transparency, and a community that’s always on the lookout. 
The best part? You’re in control.



Permissions are the backbone of Linux security. 
Every file and folder has an owner, a group, and a set of permissions (read, write, execute).

For this challenge, I decided to recreate Twitter/X, complete with access control. It&#x27;s called PermiShout. Where a Shout is like a Tweet or post. I thought this would be perfect to show off Permit.io&#x27;s base capabilities.
Here&#x27;s the app workflow:









As you can see some shouts are different than others. Some have a delete button -- that&#x27;s because Permit.io has determined that the current user has the authorization to do that.
Some reply buttons are disabled and some are not. That&#x27;s also Permit.io doing the work. Here&#x27;s some conditions that has been set up  for a user to be able to reply:

Let’s talk honestly and openly.
We pay:
Income Tax
GST
Fuel Tax
Road Tax
Toll Tax
But what do we get?

❌ Broken roads

❌ Poor public transport

❌ Slow government services

❌ Dirty cities
Dirty washrooms

Outdated machines

Less staff

Long waiting times
We are forced to go to expensive private hospitals even after paying taxes for public healthcare.
FSSAI should protect us from harmful food. But in reality:
Cold drinks full of sugar

Packaged food full of chemicals

Harmful products easily available



These are still approved by FSSAI, which runs on our tax money.

If you&#x27;re looking to create a PHP script that dynamically reads permissions from a text file and assigns them to variables, you&#x27;re in the right place! In this guide, we&#x27;ll walk through a solution that accomplishes this by utilizing plain text files for configurations, allowing an easy setup for your template. You&#x27;ll learn how to handle permissions, and variable assignment based on the contents of your file.
Understanding the Configuration File
The main file we will be reading from is Administrator.txt. This file contains various configurations listing the permissions. Each permission is either just a line with the permission name or a line formatted as permission_name: value; that assigns a power value. Here’s what our Administrator.txt file looks like:

Troubleshooting, which is the process of figuring out why something isn&#x27;t working, is a crucial skill in many areas, including networking, computer systems, and even everyday situations. CompTIA emphasizes a consistent troubleshooting method across its courses, and it&#x27;s a method that can be used for all sorts of problems. When you&#x27;re trying to solve an issue, it&#x27;s important to follow these steps in order. Skipping steps can lead to missing important details, not understanding the root cause of the problem, or making it harder to remember what you did for future reference. Below are the troubleshooting steps you will need to go through:
Identify the problem


Gather information.
Question users.
Identify symptoms.
Determine if anything has changed.

                              <span>Pack your bags up the day before. Make sure to get the basics, underwear, socks, toothbrush, medications, pjs, travel documents, license, passport, – don&#x27;t get deported, little gifts, etc... &#x27;etc...&#x27;? This etcetera is the other stuff you forget and will inevitably have to purchase at your destination. Yes, I account for this because sometimes it doesn&#x27;t matter how much time ahead I pack there is usually something I missed packing and have to either bother a relative to let me borrow it.
I don&#x27;t love forgetting stuff but at this point I rather forget than having to change my ways, like packing weeks before like my mother does. Smart lady, never forgets anything. I&#x27;m more like my dad in these type of things. &#x27;Men&#x27;.
I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a fair thing to asume, &#x27;all men are bad at packing&#x27; but I tell you, there is a pattern. My male cousin, doesn&#x27;t travel, I wonder if he would also suck at packing. I think having a comfortable amount of money makes you care less because you can just purchase what you forget at the place where you go to maybe, – saying this in the most possibly humble way. For example, I forgot to pack belts, now I have to go to a store and buy something I already had for free at home.</span>

                              <span>A lightweight RabbitMQ framework for Node.js, built to eliminate boilerplate and let you focus on business logic.
Let’s say you’re building an app with several moving parts—maybe one service processes user signups, another sends welcome emails, and another tracks analytics. Normally, these services would need to talk to each other directly and immediately—which makes things tightly connected and harder to scale.
Messaging and event-driven architecture solve this by letting each part send and receive information independently. It works like this:
When something important happens (like a new user signing up), that part of the app sends a message—think of it like dropping a letter in a mailbox.
RabbitMQ.
Here’s a simple example:

                              <span>Creating a Fibonacci sequence in JavaScript is a fascinating way to explore the world of programming and mathematics. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the relation where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore how to implement this sequence in JavaScript using a while loop, similar to the summation approach that you shared. Let&#x27;s delve into writing an efficient script for generating Fibonacci numbers.
Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and every subsequent number is derived from the sum of the two previous numbers. A brief look at the series reveals:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

My Journey

Using Permit.io for Authorization
I built AuthClinic, a comprehensive healthcare platform that revolutionizes how medical data access is managed. This isn&#x27;t just another healthcare app—it’s a carefully crafted solution that addresses one of the most critical challenges in healthcare: secure and flexible data access control.
The platform allows healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers to manage medical records, health plans, and sensitive information with unprecedented precision. What sets it apart is its sophisticated permission system that understands the complex relationships in healthcare—from family members to professional caregivers, and everything in between.

You ever stare at your GitHub contribution graph like it&#x27;s a Tamagotchi you forgot to feed?
Yeah, me too.
So I built something unholy:

A Bash-based automation daemon that ensures your GitHub profile always looks... alive.

It commits. It pushes. It even wakes your computer from the dead to do it.
⏰ Schedules fake-but-believable commits at randomized human hours

🔁 Retries if GitHub rejects your offering

💾 Logs your ritual attempts and successes

🌴 Vacation mode, so your ritual pauses when you need rest (or alibis)

🔥 Self-healing if a ritual was missed (triggered by guilt and grep)

👁️ macOS popup warnings like:
&gt; “⚠️ No ritual detected today. The square is empty. You are exposed.”
🧙 Choose your commit incantations like:


feat: added function nobody asked for
fix: removed existential crisis from variable name
📜 Add custom altar messages


🔓 Unlock rare achievements like:


&quot;100 Days of Devotion&quot;
&quot;The Sacred Streak&quot;
✅ Daily ritual cron + safety check daemon

🪞 GitHub visibility flip (goes public, commits, hides again)

🧙‍♀️ Bash installer with prompt-based setup

🏕️ Vacation flag toggle for burnout mercy

🧾 .command launcher for double-click ritualism

🎨 Coming Soon:


SVG badges

GitHub profile theme pack


Guilt Daemon™ (shames you in Slack when your squares go dark)
Yes.
I built it for fun. I also use it daily.

It’s part spiritual theater, part productivity placebo, and part real automation.
Bash
cron, pmset, at, and osascript (macOS)
GitHub CLI (gh)
Dark magic
I&#x27;m testing the waters. If enough devs want this, I’ll clean it up, ship a proper version, maybe even add a front-end GUI (Tauri? React? Electron? We’ll see).
Leave a comment if you&#x27;d actually use it — or just want the GitHub link.

                              <span>This is going to be a quick Devlog, because I just want to get back to this issue I&#x27;m having and figure out a solution for it. I&#x27;ve gone back to the drawing board, trying to figure out how to effectively unwrap the donut-shaped Voronoi diagram I have for my river tiles. I think this is the third week I&#x27;ve been working on the same problem now, so I&#x27;m getting a little frustrated because 3 weeks is a lot of time that could have been spent working on some other part of the game.
I just feel like when I do solve this, one - I won&#x27;t have to think about it again, and two - the visual pay-off will have been worth it. I also feel like I&#x27;ve invested too much time to not get some kind of pay-off for this feature.
The biggest issue that I&#x27;m having is that when I have the shapes aligned as they leave one of the corner tiles and enter the straight tile, by the time they flow along the straight path in time to reach the bottom, they&#x27;re not quite aligned.
Now I think the problem I&#x27;m having is that I&#x27;ve got a slight overlap on the tiles, the row beneath covers the row above by a couple of pixels - enough to make the borders around the tiles match up. This looks fine in practice, but I need to compensate for that when aligning the shapes, and I feel like this is throwing a spanner in the works.
So, I&#x27;m redoing my hex grid, and I&#x27;m using this article as a reference...
https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/
I&#x27;m going to try and math my way through this tonight. Wish me luck!

                              <span>This article will introduce how to quickly import csv or txt files larger than 1g into the database.
Here, we prepared a CSV file with 10 million rows x 30 columns x 4GB. At first, I tried to import it with Navicat.
The first problem I encountered was that the encoding format was unknown, which led to many attempts to find the correct encoding.
The second problem is that Navicat reads and writes one by one. Although this does not take up memory, the speed is very slow.
The third problem is that halfway through the import, an error was reported because the field length was not enough! ! ! I had to reset the field length and import from 0 again. . . What&#x27;s worse is that after setting one field, another error was reported. . .
Now, we use the DiLu Converter Import tool to solve these problems one by one.

Encoding: It can be automatically identified by default (for files with unknown encoding). If the encoding format of the file is known, you can select or enter its encoding format to speed up the parsing speed.
Chunk Size: You can set the number of rows to import at a time according to the available memory of your computer. My computer has a total of 16G memory, about 9G is available, and 500,000 is set in a batch. Here, you must set the size according to the available memory. If the setting is too large, the memory may overflow, and if the setting is too small, it will not speed up.
And The just click start
You can see that it takes about 20 seconds to import a batch of 500,000 rows, and the memory usage is less than 1G
Finally, it took about 5 minutes to import this csv file of 10 million rows x 30 columns x 4GB, and the maximum memory usage was about 1G. Because the tool imports files in batches according to batch size, no matter it is 1 file or hundreds or thousands of files, no matter a single file is 1G or 100G, as long as the batch size is set reasonably, it can be imported quickly, stably and without consuming memory.</span>

                              <span>Creating generic structures in Rust can initially seem challenging, especially when it comes to default types. In this article, we will explore how to create a generic structure with a default type, allowing users to omit the generic parameter when defining instances. We’ll investigate why the Rust compiler requires explicit type annotations in certain situations and provide a step-by-step solution to this common problem.
Why Does Rust Require Explicit Type Annotation?
Rust is a statically typed language, which means types are known at compile time. When you define a generic structure, the compiler often needs to understand what specific type to use for the generics. In your code example, you&#x27;re trying to instantiate C without specifying its type, which results in the following error:

                              <span>If you’ve ever played with dominoes, you know that the order of the numbers doesn’t matter—[1,2] is the same as [2,1]. That&#x27;s the central idea behind this popular LeetCode problem:
💡 Given a list of dominoes, return how many pairs of dominoes are equivalent. Two dominoes [a, b] and [c, d] are equivalent if:
(a &#x3D;&#x3D; c and b &#x3D;&#x3D; d) or
(a &#x3D;&#x3D; d and b &#x3D;&#x3D; c)
Let&#x27;s dive into the most optimal way to solve this!
Instead of comparing every pair (which would take O(n²) time), we can:
Normalize each domino: [a, b] becomes [min(a, b), max(a, b)]

Use a hash map to count how many times each normalized domino appears.
Every time we see a duplicate, we count how many previous identical dominoes we&#x27;ve seen.
Add that count to the result (because every new domino can pair with all previous identical ones).

                              <span>OpenSearch, a powerful distributed search and analytics engine, offers high scalability and near real-time search capabilities. However, as data volume and query complexity grow, performance bottlenecks often emerge—particularly around indices and shards.
This guide breaks down actionable strategies to optimize indexing, querying, and shard management for improved performance and cluster health.
Index: A logical namespace that maps to one or more physical shards.
Shard: A basic unit of storage and search in OpenSearch. Each shard is a Lucene index.
Performance is tightly tied to how indices and shards are structured, distributed, and queried.
Too many shards create overhead; too few limit concurrency. Aim for ideal shard sizes between 10–50 GB.
Avoid the default 5 shards unless justified.

We’ve officially reached Build 8 — our second milestone — and Tavrn is starting to feel like a real platform. This post covers our new server system, real-time messaging, roles, settings, and a few things we’re still keeping under wraps (👀).
We’ve been quiet… because we’ve been building.\
Tavrn has officially hit Build 8, our second milestone.
This one’s a big deal.
After a full system reset not too long ago, we’ve been sprinting toward one of the most important parts of any chat app: servers.
And now? They’re finally working.\
✅ Real-time messages\
channel  
This marks the first time Tavrn feels like a platform (to me atleast), not just a prototype.
With the server system online, Tavrn moves from “messaging app” to full-fledged community space.\
how people come together.
Roles let communities self-moderate.\
buttery smooth.
Of course, we’re still ironing out a few things — but this is the moment we’ve been working toward.
We’ll be honest — Build 8 isn’t just about what’s been revealed.\
other things in the works.\
But if Build 8 is this solid already?\
We’re moving fast, and we’re not stopping.\
intent, care, and a little bit of chaos.\
Stay tuned.\

La promesa de descomponer sistemas complejos en unidades independientes, facilitando despliegues ágiles, escalabilidad granular, monitoreo detallado y desarrollo autónomo, impulsa de manera significativa la eficiencia en las distintas etapas del ciclo de vida del software. No obstante, ante este conjunto de beneficios, la adopción de esta arquitectura en cualquier proyecto puede resultar riesgosa si no se aborda con una comprensión profunda de las mejores prácticas. Una arquitectura de microservicios mal diseñada puede fácilmente igualar, o incluso superar en complejidad y dificultades, a un sistema monolítico tradicional.

                              <span>PostgreSQL is a powerful and feature-rich open-source relational database, but like any complex system, its performance depends heavily on how it&#x27;s used. Whether you&#x27;re managing a startup app or a large-scale enterprise platform, optimizing PostgreSQL can lead to massive gains in speed, scalability, and efficiency.
In this article, we break down 12 proven strategies to improve database performance—covering indexing, caching, query optimization, and architectural techniques.
Create indexes based on your most common query patterns. Indexes allow PostgreSQL to find rows faster by avoiding full table scans.
Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to identify slow queries and missing indexes.
Materialized views store precomputed results of complex queries, making reads faster.

When developing a Rust application, using environment variables can streamline configurations and various setups. However, if you encounter the error &#x27;LOG_FILE must be set&#x27; while trying to log messages from your application, it might indicate that your application isn&#x27;t reading the .env file correctly. Let&#x27;s delve into how to resolve this issue so that your Rust application can access the LOG_FILE variable seamlessly.
Understanding the Issue
The error thread &#x27;main&#x27; panicked at &#x27;LOG_FILE must be set: NotPresent&#x27; signifies that the program attempted to retrieve the LOG_FILE environment variable but could not find it. This usually happens for a couple of reasons:
The .env file is not being loaded properly.
The environment variable is incorrectly specified or is missing.

                              <span>Michael Saylor’s Strategy, one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin investors, slowed its BTC purchases last week as the cryptocurrency briefly surged above $97,000.
Strategy acquired 1,895 Bitcoin (BTC) for $180.3 million during the week from April 28 to May 4 at an average price of $95,167 per BTC, the firm announced in its latest Form-8 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase is one of the smallest made by the company this year, alongside a comparatively meagre 130 BTC purchase in March.

The latest buy is 87% less than the previous purchase of 15,355 BTC announced last Monday.
Semler boosts buying despite rising prices
While Saylor’s Strategy cooled its Bitcoin buying spree last week, others upped their appetite for BTC.
Semler Scientific, a publicly traded US healthtech firm, bought 167 Bitcoin for $16.2 million in the period from April 30 to May 2 at an average purchase price of $97,093 BTC.
Announced on May 5, the purchase by Semler was up at least 50% from the previous 111 BTC purchase by the firm announced on April 25.

As of May 2, Semler held 3,634 BTC, acquired for an aggregate of $322.3 million at an average purchase price of $88,668 per BTC.
Semler’s Bitcoin holdings are considerably smaller than Strategy’s, which held 555,450 BTC as of May 4, acquired for $68,550 per BTC.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

                              <span>Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao has proposed Bitcoin and BNB as the first digital assets to build Kyrgyzstan’s national crypto reserves.
On May 5, Zhao shared on X that he had advised Kyrgyzstan to start with Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB (BNB) when building its national crypto reserve. In 2024, Forbes claimed that Zhao holds about 94 million BNB tokens, or 64% of BNB’s circulating supply. At the time of writing, these tokens are worth about $55 billion. 
The proposal followed Zhao’s earlier announcement that he had begun advising Kyrgyzstan’s National Investment Agency (NIA) on blockchain and crypto-related matters.

XRP forms a bearish descending triangle on the daily chart, risking a 45% drop to $1.20.

Declining daily active addresses signal reduced transaction activity and liquidity.

A breakout above $2.18 could invalidate the bearish pattern.

The XRP (XRP) price flashes warning signs as a bearish technical pattern emerges on its daily chart, coinciding with declining network activity. 
XRP descending triangle hints at 45% price drop
The XRP price chart has been forming a descending triangle pattern on its daily chart since its late 2024 rally, characterized by a flat support level and a downward-sloping resistance line.
A descending triangle chart pattern that forms after a strong uptrend is seen as a bearish reversal indicator. As a rule, the setup resolves when the price breaks…</span>

Web2.5 is a term used to describe a combination of Web2 and Web3 technologies. The term describes platforms or applications that blend centralized Web2 experiences with decentralized Web3 elements.

In a May 5 X post, Buterin explained that there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.
Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang explained in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:

For years, launching a crypto project in the United States has been a maze of uncertainty. Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. 
With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.
Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to…</span>

                              <span>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s digital identity project, World, formerly known as Worldcoin, faces challenges in Indonesia after local regulators temporarily suspended its registration certificates.
The Indonesian Ministry of Communications and Digital (Komdigi) has halted the Electronic System Operator Certificate Registration (TDPSE) for World and World ID over suspicious activity and alleged registration violations, the ministry announced on May 4.
After the suspension, Komdigi plans to summon World’s local subsidiaries, PT Terang Bulan Abadi and PT Sandina Abadi Nusantara, to provide clarification on the alleged violations, it stated.
According to a preliminary investigation, World’s PT Terang Bulan Abadi was allegedly operating without TDPSE, while PT Sandina Abadi Nusantara — the subsidiary…</span>

During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 
Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players’ interests. 
“We’re going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they’re not sustainable,” he said.

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…</span>

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. 
As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market. 
Here are five major stablecoin initiatives projected to grow crypto adoption.

BTC price action attempts to hold the yearly open as support after some downside at the weekly close, but bullish perspectives remain intact.

The US Federal Reserve interest rate decision is the key macro event of the week, with Chair Jerome Powell tipped to “move markets.”

Jobless claims and Coinbase earnings add to a mixed bag of potential volatility triggers as recession talk gets louder.

Bitcoin dominance hits 65% for the first time in over four years, but analysis thinks its days are numbered.

Bitcoin “FOMO” is still waiting in the wings as sentiment flips positive.

In a wide-ranging interview with Kristen Welker on NBC News’ Meet the Press released on May 4, Trump said he was “not profiting from anything” when asked to respond to critics who said he’s profiting from the presidency through the memecoin.
“So you’re not profiting off of the cryptocurrency at all?” Welker asked Trump.
“I haven’t even looked,” Trump admitted.
“But I’ll tell you what. Look, if I own stock in something and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting.”

A DEX aggregator is a service that pulls data from multiple decentralized exchanges and market makers and then presents it to users to assist with trading. Xu says, “OKX Web3 is a browser and search engine for blockchain.”

Shrem shared his new Bitcoin (BTC) faucet website — 21million.com — in a May 4 X post, which mimics the first-ever Bitcoin CAPTCHA page created by early Bitcoin innovator Gavin Andresen back in 2010.
The 21million.com website currently displays a screenshot of a CAPTCHA task and a box to enter a receiving Bitcoin address, which was not functional at the time of writing. 
Shrem’s Bitcoin faucet website also shows that there are 0 Bitcoin available to claim.
Like Andresen’s old website, Shrem’s page explains what Bitcoin is and how to receive Bitcoin.

                              <span>The Australian crypto industry has called on the newly reelected Labor government to urgently make digital asset legislation a top priority to ensure Australia doesn’t fall further behind global markets.
The incumbent Australian Labor Party was returned in a landslide on May 3, picking up 54.9% of the two-party-preferred vote, against the Liberal and National Parties on 45.1%. Both parties went to the election promising crypto law reform, but only the opposition pledged to deliver draft legislation within 100 days. 
Joy Lam, Binance’s head of global regulatory and APAC legal, said the exchange has been consulting with Treasury officials since late 2023 about its proposed legislation, and it was now time for action.

The US-based Bitcoin (BTC) funds bought a whopping 18,644 Bitcoin over the past week when only 3,150 BTC were mined for the period, reported asset allocator HODL15Capital on May 4.
This accumulation by institutions and ETF issuers represents almost six times the amount of the asset being produced since miners only generate 450 coins per day.  
The total inflow for the past five trading days was around $1.8 billion, with a net outflow on April 30, according to Farside Investors. There has only been one outflow day since April 16, as the inflows have mirrored market recovery.

The company released an update to its GPT‑4o model on April 25 that made it “noticeably more sycophantic,” which it then rolled back three days later due to safety concerns, OpenAI said in a May 2 postmortem blog post.
The ChatGPT maker said its new models undergo safety and behavior checks, and its “internal experts spend significant time interacting with each new model before launch,” meant to catch issues missed by other tests.
During the latest model’s review process before it went public, OpenAI said that “some expert testers had indicated that the model’s behavior ‘felt’ slightly off” but decided to launch “du…</span>

The spurious messages were first discovered on May 3 by Kerberus founder and CEO Alex Katz, who shared a screenshot of a message made out to be from author and journalist Paul Sperry via the official nypost account.

There is no known exploit of the vulnerability, and Solana validators have since adopted the patched version, the foundation said.

Bitcoin’s positive sentiment should remain intact if BTC price stays above the 20-day EMA near $92,000.

Several altcoins show bullish chart patterns in the 4-hour and 1-day timeframes.

Bitcoin (BTC) has given back some of the gains over the weekend, and the price has pulled back to the breakout level of $95,000. Buyers will have to successfully hold the $95,000 level to keep the bullish momentum intact.
Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that Bitcoin could surge to a new all-time high and reach a target of $135,000 in the next 100 days if certain conditions are met. Peterson believes a drop in the CBOE Volatility Index below 18 could trigger a “risk-on environment” favoring Bitcoin. The other crucial points needed for the Bitcoin rally are a fall …</span>

Let’s be honest — most software engineering interviews suck.
They’re filled with algorithmic trivia, abstract whiteboarding, and awkward “culture fit” questions that have nothing to do with the actual job. The result? Interviews that waste time for everyone and still fail to identify great engineers.
This blog is for both interviewers and interviewees — whether you’re designing a hiring process or preparing for one. The goal is to make interviews practical, time-efficient, and focused on what truly matters: real-world engineering skills.
What follows is a no-nonsense framework based on real projects, meaningful collaboration, and practical coding. It respects your time, cuts the fluff, and gives you real signal — fast.

Between burnout, client work, and staring blankly at VS Code for hours — keeping your GitHub streak alive can feel like a second unpaid job.
I used to obsess over my GitHub activity like it was a Tamagotchi that needed daily care. Miss a day? Anxiety. Miss two? Shame spiral.
But after years of freelance chaos and working in private repos no one can see, I realized something:
I was doing real work... and still looking inactive.

That green grid didn’t reflect my grind.
So here are 3 ways I’ve learned to keep my GitHub looking alive — without coding every single day like a productivity martyr.
One of the most common mistakes devs make is trying to force daily pushes just to fill the grid.
Instead:

After a major setback wiped our codebase, we rebuilt Tavrn&#x27;s 1-to-1 DM system from scratch — in just 3 days. This post breaks down how we did it, what’s new, and why it’s already better than before.
After losing our original codebase, we had two choices:

Start over slowly and mourn the loss...

Or hit the ground running and build something better.
We chose the second one.
It only took 3 days — but our 1-to-1 messaging system is back.

Fully rebuilt from the ground up. Clean. Fast. Future-proof.

And, honestly? It’s better than what we had before.
We redesigned how messages move, how conversations flow, and how it all scales.

What used to feel basic now feels tight — like something you’ll actually want to use every day.
Here’s a little peek at what’s already working in our new DM system:
🔒 Fast messaging with improved delivery speeds

🌙 Sleeker UI built with clarity and vibe in mind

🗂️ Better message rendering
💬 Typing indicators and presence detection, redone the right way

⚡️ A system that can grow without getting messy



And we’re just getting started.
Now that DMs are locked in, we’re moving on to polish other core features — including group chats, profiles, and real-time updates.
Every step is built with community, performance, and personality in mind.

No bloat. No noise. Just smooth, satisfying conversation.
Setbacks happen. But we’re proud of how we responded:

By building. By improving. By actually shipping something better.
If you’ve been waiting on Tavrn — thank you.

The foundation is back. And the future’s right behind it.

                              <span>Shopping—a timeless ritual familiar to us all—is quietly undergoing a profound transformation. Gone are the days when shopping was nothing more than exchanging goods for currency. Today, beneath the familiar surface of the high street and online storefronts, an intricate interplay of data-driven intelligence and personalised precision shapes the retail landscape.
At the epicentre of this quiet upheaval is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Not a futuristic novelty from distant sci-fi narratives, but a living, evolving presence within retail operations worldwide. By 2025, AI’s role in retail is forecasted to be valued at an astounding £54.92 billion. A recent Gartner report underscores its importance starkly: 91% of retail IT leaders now regard AI as a core strategic priority. AI, it seems, has …</span>

                              <span>I have been in team meetings where, they were basically, &quot;free-form discussions.&quot;
We&#x27;d start with good intentions, but two hours later, no real decisions have been made.
It was frustrating, and the team&#x27;s energy was draining with each meeting.
The problem?
We needed structure, not just good intentions.
So, we started implementing detailed agendas for every meeting.
At first, it felt a bit rigid, but then with time, our two-hour meetings actually ended in 45 minutes or less.
People came prepared. Decisions were made faster.
But here&#x27;s the thing - it&#x27;s not just about having an agenda.
It&#x27;s about crafting one that guides the conversation without stifling creativity.
We found a balance between structure and flexibility with Rally.
This experience played a huge role in why you can build agendas from your Jira board with Rally.
How do you structure your team meetings?
Have you found any agenda hacks that work particularly well? (👀🟣)

If you’re like me, you probably keep hearing about how AI is changing everything and how there are all these ways to make some money on the side using it. But most articles are either too high-level or super vague. So I thought I’d share a real, working example you can try out right now, with code you can copy, tweak, and make your own.
Let’s build a small tool that uses AI to help people write blog posts faster. You can use it for yourself, or offer it as a service to others (think freelance gigs, or even a small SaaS).
A command-line Python app that:
Takes a blog topic from the user
Uses OpenAI to generate an outline and a draft
Saves the draft to a file
You can run this on your laptop, or turn it into a web app later. The main thing is: it works, and it’s a great starting po…</span>

Solution
Create an input field
Add a button
The button should have a function that: 
adds the content of the input to a list below


Resets the input field after adding an item


Checks if the item being added has been added previously.



It is important to note that this question was obtained from an online test platform which provided a boilerplate code. So I had this to start with:
import { useState } from &quot;react&quot;;
import &quot;h8k-components&quot;;

import &quot;./App.css&quot;;

function App() {
  const [items, setItems] &#x3D; useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] &#x3D; useState(&quot;&quot;);

  const handleAddItem &#x3D; () &#x3D;&gt; {
    // TODO: Add logic to add input to items list

That said, Windows isn&#x27;t the villain some developers make it out to be. It plays nicer with commercial software, gaming tools, and corporate systems. Windows users now have a solid option with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), letting you run Linux tools right inside Windows - giving you the best of both worlds without the commitment of switching entirely.
Ultimately, great developers build amazing stuff on all systems. Your OS is just one piece of your toolkit, not the defining factor of your skills. My switch to Linux boosted my workflow for web and backend projects, but I know plenty of rockstar devs crushing it on Windows and Mac.

  The Coffee Machine Analogy


Imagine assembling a high-tech coffee machine:
Water Tank → Your data (documents, APIs, databases).
Filter → The retriever (fetches relevant chunks).
Boiler → The LLM (generates answers).
Cup → Your polished response.
LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is the instruction manual that snaps these pieces together seamlessly. No duct tape or spaghetti code—just clean, modular pipelines.
LCEL lets you build production-ready RAG systems with:
Retriever → Searches your vector DB (like a librarian).
Prompt Template → Formats the question + context for the LLM.
LLM → Generates the answer (e.g., GPT-4, Claude).
Output Parser → Cleans up responses (e.g., extracts text, JSON).
Turn your vector DB into a sea…</span>

                              <span>In Kotlin, it’s common to encounter various types of comparison errors, especially when dealing with Java classes due to interoperability issues. The issue you&#x27;re experiencing occurs when trying to compare an instance of the ExitStatus class from Spring Batch using the &#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;/code operator.
Understanding the Comparison in Kotlin
Kotlin has a distinct approach to equality compared to Java. In Kotlin, the &#x3D;&#x3D; operator is actually syntactic sugar for the equals() method. Thus, when you write if (jobExecution.exitStatus &#x3D;&#x3D; ExitStatus.COMPLETED), Kotlin attempts to call equals() on the jobExecution.exitStatus.  However, if Kotlin does not recognize ExitStatus as having a valid equals method that matches the expected types, you will receive the compilation error: No method &#x27;equals(Any?): Boolean&#x27; av…</span>

Managing food allergies and dietary restrictions can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially when you want to make sure every meal is safe and fits your nutrition goals. I realized there wasn’t a simple tool that could help me quickly identify safe foods and suggest meals tailored to my needs. So, as a good developer, I decided to build one myself.
In this post, I want to share on of the feature that I added to the product: how to programmatically post to Facebook after a recipe is created.

Removing and Managing ACLs


Best Practices

Summary
In Linux, we usually use chmod and chown to manage file permissions. That works well when you just need to give access to one user and one group. But what if you need to give access to multiple users or different groups on the same file?
That&#x27;s where ACLs (Access Control Lists) come in. They allow you to control file access in a much more detailed way.
Standard permissions only allow:
One owner (user)
One group
Let’s say you want to:
Give read-only access to one user
Allow full access to another user
And block a group from accessing the file
You can’t do this wi…</span>

                              <span>Introduction
If you&#x27;ve found yourself wondering why the AWS CLI ignores --include options when you run a complex command through a Bash script, you&#x27;re not alone. Many users experience unexpected behavior when executing AWS S3 commands, especially when utilizing recursive downloads along with --exclude and --include flags. Understanding how these flags work together in the context of Bash scripts can be crucial for achieving the desired results without unnecessary downloads.
Understanding the Issue
The primary cause of the problem you&#x27;re encountering is how the Bash script is interpreting the command instructions. When we involve special characters, spacing, and quotes in Bash, it’s easy for commands to be parsed incorrectly compared to when they’re executed directly in the terminal.

Qwen 3, the latest iteration of Alibaba Cloud&#x27;s Qwen series, is a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) designed for advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, code completion, and multi-modal reasoning. Its hardware requirements depend on the specific use case (training vs. inference), model size (e.g., parameter count), and deployment environment (cloud vs. on-premise). This report outlines the necessary hardware specifications for various scenarios.
  Parameter Count: Qwen 3 is expected to scale from 7 billion (7B) to 100+ billion (100B+) parameters, with potential variants like Qwen 3-7B, Qwen 3-72B, and Qwen 3-100B. Larger models require more memory and computational power.

                              <span>As a developer, you&#x27;re likely no stranger to Git, the powerful version control system that helps you manage changes to your codebase. However, for those just starting out or looking to solidify their understanding, two fundamental commands can often cause confusion: git init and git clone. In this post, we&#x27;ll dive into the differences between these commands, when to use each, and how they fit into your overall Git workflow.
git init: Starting a New Project from Scratch
When you&#x27;re beginning a new project and want to put it under version control, git init is the command you&#x27;ll use. This command creates a new Git repository in your project directory, initializing it with a hidden .git folder that tracks changes to your code.
Here&#x27;s a step-by-step breakdown of what happens when you run git in…</span>

Financial institutions have to build intelligent Risk management systems leveraging AI/ML which can defect and present malicious activities. Ability of computing power with the evolution of cloud computing has enabled leveraging machine learning(ML) for Risk management functions like anti money laundering.
Data is the foundation of any machine learning project. One of key consideration is availability of high quality data as data quality plays a vital role in identifying and mitigating financial crimes.

                              <span>In Scala, using type members and type classes can lead to complex code, particularly when dealing with self-referential types. This article guides you through calling the getFor method from a SAM trait called DiscriminatorCriteria, utilizing Scala&#x27;s powerful type system and quoted expressions.
Understanding DiscriminatorCriteria Trait
The DiscriminatorCriteria trait defines a method getFor that takes a type parameter &lt;V &lt;: A. Here&#x27;s the trait&#x27;s signature:
trait DiscriminatorCriteria[A] {
    def getFor[V &lt;: A]: Int
}

The Issue at Hand
When working with mirrors and type reflections in Scala, particularly in macros or complex type derivation, it is common to encounter type mismatches. In your case, the issue arises when specifying headType as a type argument for the getFor method. This happ…</span>

                              <span>✅ Reviewed PR
The most subtle bugs aren&#x27;t in the code you write - they&#x27;re in the code you approve without enough context.
This is a short story about a seemingly harmless line in a PR that I reviewed - and how it taught me to slow down, even with small changes.
The line of code below,
if(!user.isVerified) return;

intention behind this was good not to allow unverified users to proceed into the app.
But this return statement wasn&#x27;t part of larger flow. It was inside a route guard - and it exited silently, without a redirect, message or error.
User who signed up with Google or Github (OAuth) were marked isVerified&#x3D;false
This line caused the app to fail to load the protected dashboard, but displayed no error
The app just failed silently with blank screen to user.
A fallback route with clear message was added and tested both social and email/password flows going forward.
if(!user.isVerified) {
    this.route.navigate([&#x27;/verify-email&#x27;]);
    return;
}

Ill walk you through the timeline of my roles, highlight the key skills and decisions that shaped my path, and share what I would do differently if I were just starting my transition today. My hope is that anyone looking to shift into tech or cybersecurity can take something useful from this.

Do you ever feel overwhelmed by tech newsletters? As a fullstack developer, you need to stay up to date across multiple areas — frontend, backend, databases, infrastructure, and more.
Personally, I’m subscribed to at least 15 newsletters, and I love them all — spoiler alert: I list most of them at the end of the article. But if I miss a day or two, my “DEV” folder starts overflowing. I often spend hours on the weekend catching up — reading inspiring articles, testing snippets, and discovering new tools. It’s one of the best ways to grow and stay sharp.
But let’s be honest — keeping up with everything is exhausting.

                              <span>Hey there, fellow developer! 👋 Let’s talk about a nightmare we’ve all had:

You’re deploying code to AWS, fingers crossed, praying it doesn’t take down your entire app. The loading spinner mocks you. Your Slack DMs blow up: “Is the site down??”  
But what if you could deploy updates with zero downtime while sipping coffee? Enter GitHub Actions + AWS—the dynamic duo that’ll turn you into the calmest dev in the room.  
Why GitHub Actions + AWS?




No More “It Works on My Machine”: Deploy from a clean, consistent environment every time.


Zero Downtime: Blue/green deployments, Lambda aliases, and S3 magic keep your site alive.


Free (Mostly): GitHub Actions gives you 2000 free minutes/month.



Let’s automate your AWS deploys like a pro.

Когда количество пользователей растет экспоненциально, объем данных увеличивается, а требования к функциональности усложняются? Именно здесь на первый план выходит масштабируемость — способность системы эффективно справляться с растущей нагрузкой.
PERN-стек (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) предоставляет мощный набор инструментов для создания современных веб-приложений. Но сам по себе стек не гарантирует масштабируемости. Ключ кроется в архитектуре — в том, как вы структурируете ваш код, проектируете базу данных и организуете взаимодействие компонентов.

                              <span>In the fast-paced world of software development, Quality Assurance (QA) Testers are the unsung heroes ensuring that what we build actually works — and works well. They test end to end to ensure the products meet its requirement and specification. They look for loopholes, and prevent bugs in production.
Here’s why QA is essential:
✅ Bug Prevention, Not Just Detection: QA testers help catch issues early, saving time and resources before bugs make it to production.
✅ Improved User Experience: They think like end users, helping to ensure a smooth, intuitive experience.
✅ Boosts Developer Efficiency: Engineers can focus on building, knowing QA has their back on quality.
✅ Confidence to Ship: With QA sign-off, teams can deploy with peace of mind.
✅ Maintains Brand Reputation: High-quality, reliable software keeps users happy and loyal.
A great QA Tester doesn’t just test — they collaborate, communicate, and elevate the whole team.
Let’s stop thinking of QA as the last step, and instead, an integral part of the process from Day One. 💡</span>

                              <span>Com o crescimento das ferramentas de inteligência artificial (IA) como ChatGPT, Gemini e DeepSeek, muitos usuários buscam maneiras de otimizar suas interações para obter respostas mais precisas e relevantes. Uma estratégia eficaz é organizar as conversas por temas ou especialidades. Essa abordagem não apenas mantém o contexto claro, mas também reduz erros e mal-entendidos.
🎯 Por que Organizar as Conversas por Tema?
Manutenção do Contexto: Ao separar as conversas por tópicos específicos, a IA pode entender melhor o assunto em questão, proporcionando respostas mais alinhadas às suas necessidades.
Histórico Claro: Ter conversas distintas para cada tema facilita a revisão de informações anteriores, permitindo que você retome discussões passadas sem confusão.
Redução de Erros: Misturar assuntos em uma única conversa pode levar a respostas imprecisas. Ao manter tópicos separados, você minimiza esse risco.
🛠️ Dicas para Organizar Suas Conversas
Crie Títulos Específicos: Nomeie cada conversa com um título que reflita claramente o tema abordado, como “Dicas de UX/UI” ou “Aprendizado de Python”.
Utilize Etiquetas ou Pastas: Se a plataforma permitir, categorize suas conversas em pastas ou com etiquetas para facilitar o acesso futuro.
Inicie com um Contexto Claro: Ao começar uma nova conversa, forneça informações detalhadas sobre o que você espera da IA, incluindo objetivos e restrições.
📈 Benefícios a Longo Prazo
Adotar essa abordagem estruturada não apenas melhora a qualidade das respostas, mas também transforma a IA em uma ferramenta mais eficaz para aprendizado e trabalho. Com conversas bem organizadas, você economiza tempo, evita retrabalho e maximiza o potencial das ferramentas de IA.
Organizar suas interações com inteligências artificiais por temas ou especialidades é uma prática simples, mas poderosa. Ao implementar essa estratégia, você garante conversas mais produtivas, claras e eficientes, aproveitando ao máximo o que essas ferramentas têm a oferecer.</span>

MedRecord is a modern, privacy-first medical records management system that empowers doctors and patients with secure access to health data while giving administrators full oversight. We tackled the problem of data access control in healthcare — ensuring that only authorised users can read, update, or manage sensitive medical records.
With Permit.io, we implemented Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing
Admins to manage the entire system
Doctors can view all records but update only their assigned patients
Patients to view only their personal records
By decoupling permissions logic from our codebase, we built a scalable and maintainable system that’s easy to au…</span>

echo vs print: An Overview


Both echo and print are language constructs in PHP that are used to output data to the screen. While they may seem interchangeable, there are subtle differences:
Syntax and Efficiency: 
echo can accept multiple parameters, whereas print can only take one argument.
echo is slightly faster as it doesn’t return any value, allowing for better performance in large-scale applications.
Return Values: 
echo does not return any value.

Let’s be honest.
Most AI projects right now are duct-taped chains of:
Prompt injections
Tool wrappers
Hidden state
Zero traceability
And god help you if something breaks.
You run your LLM call and hope it works.

No visibility. No logic. No composability.

It&#x27;s brittle. It’s opaque. And it&#x27;s slowing real progress.
I didn’t want to “wrap” LLMs. I wanted to compose cognition.
That means:
✅ Declarative logic (YAML, not code spaghetti)
✅ Modular agent types (search, classify, validate, build, etc.)
✅ Dynamic flow control (forks, joins, routers)
✅ Real-time introspection (Redis/Kafka logs)
✅ Reusable, testable reasoning blocks
✅ Full execution replay
So I built OrKa:

I tested various models with this straightforward financial question: &quot;I have initially 100 USD in an account that gives 3.42% interest/year for the first 2 years then switches to a 3% interest/year. How much will I have after 5 years?&quot;

                              <span>Introduction
In programming, passing parameters to functions is crucial for manipulating data effectively. Java, unlike some languages such as C#, does not support reference parameters in the same way. Instead, Java uses pass-by-value semantics, which means that when you pass a variable to a method, a copy of that variable is sent. However, there are ways to achieve similar functionality using mutable objects or wrapper classes. In this article, we&#x27;ll explore how to simulate reference-like behavior in Java using simple examples and provide a clear understanding of handling output parameters in functions.
Understanding Reference Parameters in Java
When you define a method parameter in Java, it typically receives a copy of the variable&#x27;s value. If you want to modify the value of an object re…</span>

1 INTRODUÇÃO
Hoje em dia, com quase tudo conectado à internet, a segurança dos sistemas de software virou uma grande preocupação. Ataques e acessos indevidos podem acontecer a qualquer momento, e por isso é tão importante que os sistemas já sejam pensados para se proteger desde o começo.
Quando se fala em segurança, fala-se da proteção dos dados e do bom funcionamento do sistema em geral, mesmo diante de possíveis ameaças. Isso é ainda mais importante em áreas como os sistemas do governo, ecommerce ou qualquer serviço que lida com informações sensíveis e confidenciais. Ou seja, desenvolver sistemas usando técnicas seguras é algo essencial para garantir confiança e evitar prejuízos em todos os aspectos.

Setting up a simple video stream server using Python and the aiortc library might seem challenging at first, especially when integrating both Python and HTML/JavaScript components. In this article, we will explore a code example that demonstrates creating a basic Python video streaming server and the corresponding JavaScript code to connect to it. This implementation leverages WebRTC for real-time communication, focusing on a local network setup to stream video from a server to a browser.
Understanding the Problem
When working with WebRTC, one common issue developers face is related to Session Description Protocol (SDP) errors, specifically ValueError: None is not in list. This typically occurs when the offer or answer SDPs being exchanged do not contain valid track informatio…</span>

So far we built a web experience, as well as a command line interface for the game. However, unlike the web version, the command line interface is strictly local. There’s no way to share the game with a fellow friend unless we walk them through the setup. Coincidentally, a former coworker recently told me about hosting applications over secure shell protocol in Golang. That makes me wonder, how easily can we replicate it in Python?

                              <span>When working with Go, handling JSON data is a common task. In the code snippet you&#x27;re referring to, we see the use of a specific method: (*jsontext.Value)(&amp;b).Indent(). This can be a bit confusing for those who are new to Go or JSON manipulation. So let’s break it down.
Understanding JSON Marshaling in Go
In Go, the encoding/json package is typically used to encode and decode JSON. In your example, b, _ :&#x3D; json.Marshal(output) marshals the output variable into a JSON byte slice b. The underscore _ is used to ignore any errors that may occur during marshaling. This is often a pattern when we are confident that there won&#x27;t be an error or we want to handle it later.
What is *jsontext.Value?
The section (*jsontext.Value)(&amp;b).Indent() involves a couple of key components. First, jsontext.Value i…</span>

If you’ve ever wanted to deploy a full-stack application without worrying about managing servers or scaling infrastructure, Google Cloud Run is a game-changer. In this post, we’ll walk through deploying a modern React frontend and Node.js backend using Cloud Run — Google Cloud’s fully managed container platform. Whether you&#x27;re building a personal project or a production app, Cloud Run helps you go live quickly.
Architecture Overview
Here’s a simplified flow of how the app works:
Users access the frontend hosted on Cloud Run.
The frontend makes API requests to the backend, also hosted on Cloud Run.
The backend processes the requests and sends back responses (JSON data).
Cloud Run handles traffic, scaling, and security for both services.

🆚 Auto-Instrumentation vs Manual-Instrumentation in OpenTelemetry



Feature
Auto-Instrumentation
Manual Instrumentation




Definition
Automatically instruments supported libraries and frameworks using OpenTelemetry wrappers.
Requires you to explicitly define spans in code using the OpenTelemetry API.


Setup
Minimal changes — just install dependencies and run via opentelemetry-instrument CLI.
Requires importing OTEL SDK and wrapping logic with spans manually.


Use Cases
Quick observability setup, ideal for supported web frameworks like Flask, Django, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.
Fine-grained control — custom logic,…</span>

This issue often arises from the way matrices—specifically the view-projection matrix—are combined when rendering a scene. In your code, you mention that the screen position moves in the opposite direction when you rotate the camera. Let&#x27;s delve deeper into why this might be happening and how we can fix it effectively.
Understanding the Problem
In your code, you set up the view and projection matrices and then combine them to create a view-projection matrix. However, if the view matrix isn&#x27;t correctly set up to reflect the camera&#x27;s orientation, the resulting transformations can appear inverted or mirrored. To ensure proper functiona…</span>

Hey there! I&#x27;m Aadarsh Verma,
Sure, I could&#x27;ve chosen Java or Kotlin, but who has time for that when you&#x27;re juggling college assignments, right? That&#x27;s when I discovered React Native - same JavaScript foundation, but for mobile apps! Win-win! 🎯
Let me be real with you - I failed multiple times trying to build this Google Auth + CRUD app. The lack of proper tutorials, mentors, and clear guidance was frustrating. But you know what? I had two secret weapons: determination and the official React Native Firebase documentation! 
Let&#x27;s jump right in and create our React Native app with Firebase integration.
// I&#x27;m using Bare React Native
// Open your terminal and run:
npx react-native init fireApp

// This command will download all necessary files and dependencies

First, install …</span>

In any software project, every small change made to the codebase is recorded in Git history. This history is not just a log of what happened — it&#x27;s a crucial tool for tracking changes, collaborating with others, managing releases, and automating development workflows.
It becomes hard to understand why a change was made
Generating changelogs becomes manual and time-consuming
CI/CD tools can’t effectively leverage the commit history
And in team environments, others struggle to follow your changes
This is where Conventional Commits come into play. It’s a simple but powerful convention that allows us to write commit messages in a structured, readable, and machine-parsable way — making life easier for both developers and tools.

                              <span>Recently in enterprise development, I came across a requirement to adjust and optimize a scheduled email-sending task. While the logic itself was straightforward, the debugging experience was not.
Here&#x27;s what made it tricky:
The development environment lacks a unified interface to manually trigger backend @Scheduled tasks from the frontend.
Debugging by modifying the cron expression means:


Restarting the entire project every time
Risking a flood of unintended emails






While test code can directly invoke methods, it&#x27;s not always clean or convenient.
Let’s look at the scheduled task:
@Component
public class EmailScheduled {

    @Scheduled(cron &#x3D; &quot;0 0 23 * * * ?&quot;)
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    }        
}

afterPropertiesSet to Trigger the Task


The idea is simple: leverage the InitializingBean interface. Spring will automatically call afterPropertiesSet() when initializing a bean. So we can invoke emailSend() there to simulate a scheduled run.
@Component
public class EmailScheduled implements InitializingBean {

    @Scheduled(cron &#x3D; &quot;0 0 23 * * * ?&quot;)
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    } 

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        emailSend(); // Triggered once at startup
    }
}

No cron modification
No project restart just to adjust time
No actual scheduling triggered — just one-time manual invocation
Perfect for short-term debugging during development
This is not meant to be a long-term solution. Remember to remove or disable this hack before deploying to production. For a more robust setup, consider exposing your scheduled tasks through an admin/debug endpoint or using Spring Boot Actuator with proper security controls.</span>

There&#x27;s a lot of confusion today with the &quot;DocumentDB&quot; name because earlier this year Microsoft announced DocumentDB: Open-Source Announcement which has nothing to do with Amazon DocumentDB.
Amazon DocumentDB is a managed NoSQL database service that supports document data structures and is compatible with MongoDB versions 3.6, 4.0, and 5.0. It allows users to store, query, and index JSON data. Its storage capabilities resemble those of Amazon Aurora, featuring compute and storage separation, a monolithic read-write node, up to 15 read-only replicas, and multi-AZ storage.

Accessibility is a broad topic that covers many areas and details, but I&#x27;ll aim to provide an overall understanding from a web developer&#x27;s perspective.
Accessibility means developing content to be as accessible as possible, no matter an individual&#x27;s physical and cognitive abilities and how they access the web.
MDN
What is Accessibility?
Law
WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) as the foundation for the accessibility standards.
Canada: The Standard on Web Accessibility requires all federal government websites to comply with WCAG 2.0 Level AA. 
Japan: The JIS X 8341-3 standard is aligned with WCAG, specifically addressing web accessibility for older adults and people with disabilities. …</span>

                              <span>When building applications with Dart and Flutter, you might come across the frustrating issue of losing data on a TextInput field when the keyboard is dismissed. This typically occurs because the state of the input field is not being managed correctly. By utilizing a TextEditingController, you can ensure that the value users type into the text field remains intact even after they click &#x27;Ok&#x27; or use the back button to hide the keyboard.
Understanding TextEditingController
In Flutter, a TextEditingController is an object that can be used to control a text field. It helps in retrieving the current value of the text field, listening to changes, and manipulating it. If you don’t initialize a TextEditingController, the text field will not maintain its state after interactions.

                              <span>Modern Android development is all about writing clean, efficient, and asynchronous code — and Kotlin Coroutines have become the go-to tool for that. If you&#x27;re tired of callback hell and want to write non-blocking, readable code, coroutines are your best friend.
In this post, we&#x27;ll cover:
✅ What are Coroutines?

📱 Real-world Android examples
A coroutine is a lightweight thread that can be suspended and resumed. It allows you to perform long-running tasks like network calls or database operations without blocking the main thread.
Coroutine &#x3D; Co + routine i.e. it&#x27;s the cooperation among routines(functions).

                              <span>A smart developer once said: 
&quot;Clean code isn’t some magic skill — it’s just a habit you build over time.&quot;
And guess what? You can totally build that habit.
Clean code means writing code that&#x27;s clear, organized, and easy to work with. It makes your life (and your teammates’ lives) way easier. But let’s be honest — how many times have we said, “I’ll clean this up later”?
Here’s the truth:
There’s never a perfect time to refactor
Messy code turns into technical debt — and sooner or later, you’ll have to deal with it. It’s better to start clean than to fix bugs forever later.
Writing clean code isn’t as hard as it sounds. Actually, it can feel really natural once you get the hang of it. Think of it like building something with care — not just typing stuff out.

  What I Built


I built AutoSecure API Gateway, a robust API gateway solution for the automotive industry that implements API-first authorization principles. By leveraging Permit.io&#x27;s NGINX integration, the project externalizes authorization logic from application code and enforces fine-grained access control at the gateway layer. This ensures consistent, centralized, and declarative policy enforcement across all APIs.
The project demonstrates real-world use cases, such as managing vehicle telemetry, fleet operations, and driver analytics, while supporting multiple roles like vehicle owners, service technicians, and fleet managers.

However managing chemical purchasing efficiently requires more than just comparing prices. It demands a careful balance of safety compliance cost savings and strong supplier partnerships.
When it comes to chemicals compliance is non-negotiable. Companies must stay updated on regulations like REACH OSHA EPA or local environmental laws. Start by creating an internal compliance checklist that covers everything from product labeling to storage and transportation rules. Work only with suppliers who provide clear documentation including safety data sheets and certifications.

                              <span>What Drives New Languages Like Rust and Go to Embrace Composition and Abandon Inheritance?
Java has a guideline: “Don’t use inheritance unless you have a good reason.” But Java doesn’t strictly limit inheritance — you can still use it freely. Go, however, is different: it only allows composition.
So why do modern languages promote composition? Actually, it’s not just new languages — even the veteran Java mentions in Item 16 of Effective Java: “Favor composition over inheritance.” Inheritance is a powerful way to reuse code, but it may not be the best method.
So it’s worth thinking this through carefully. Without diving into specific code, let&#x27;s talk about the concepts. I believe we can explore this topic from the following perspectives:

In the middle of a long workday, how many times have you written a Slack message, paused, and thought:
“Hmm… that sounds too harsh. Should I rewrite that?”
Or:
“Can this be clearer? Simpler? More polite?”
Now you don’t have to second guess.
Parrot is a Slack app that transforms your raw, rushed, or robotic messages into something more human — with improved politeness, clarity, or simplicity.
You just type:
/polite Can you do this now?
And Parrot replies:
&quot;Would you be able to do this when you get a chance?&quot;
Or:
/clarity Let’s sync up sometime soon.
And Parrot says:
&quot;Let’s schedule a quick meeting this week to align.&quot;
It’s like Grammarly — but instant, and inside Slack.

decorate behaviour in a clean and reusable way. Like adding toppings to a pizza 🍕
⚠️ Decorators are a Stage-3 proposal in JavaScript. You can use them with TypeScript or Babel.
A decorator is a special function you can attach to:
A class
A class method
A class property
It looks like this:
@myDecorator
class MyClass {}

Or for methods:
class MyClass {
  @log
  doSomething() {}
}

Think of a decorator as a function that wraps the original function, property, or class to change its behavior.
Here&#x27;s what happens behind the scenes for method decorators:
When the class is defined, decorators are executed.
The decorator function receives three arguments:

                              <span>During a recent incident, our team observed message loss from a Kafka producer during an Amazon MSK rolling patch. What began as a routine upgrade quickly uncovered hidden weaknesses in our producer&#x27;s configuration.
As we dug into the issue, I developed a clearer picture of how Kafka producers interact with broker leaders and what it truly takes to build a production-grade, fault-tolerant producer pipeline. This post captures those insights—covering the critical configuration options that influence message delivery reliability and the mechanisms behind them.
Let’s begin by examining how message loss can occur during a rolling patch—and then broaden the lens to explore other scenarios where Kafka messages might be at risk.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across industries, promising unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. However, the success of AI initiatives is inextricably linked to the quality and readiness of the data that powers them. As the saying goes, &quot;garbage in, garbage out&quot; – this maxim is particularly relevant in AI implementation, where poor data quality leads directly to unreliable outputs, biased decisions, and failed projects.
This comprehensive guide explores data readiness assessment for AI implementation, providing a structured framework to evaluate if your organization&#x27;s data is prepared to support successful AI initiatives. We&#x27;ll examine key components of data readiness, assessment methodologies, and best practic…</span>

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that combines large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources. In this project, I implemented a RAG system using Python, Firebase Functions, OpenAI for embeddings, and Pinecone as the vector database. The system exposes three main APIs: indexing data, searching, and deleting namespaces. Let’s break down the concepts behind each API.
Concept:

Before you can search your data with natural language, you need to convert it into a format that a machine can understand and compare. Th…</span>

-Thus is a submission for the Permit.io Authorization Challenge: Permission Redefined
What I Build
This project solves a very real-world need: teams need to collaborate, but not everyone should have the same powers. QuickCollab ensures users see and can act on only what they&#x27;re authorized for — no more, no less.
Demo
https://permit-frontend-oafvwri0e-navankurusersessionmanagement.vercel.app/
Project Repo

Using Permit.io for Authorization
🔐 Used @permitio/sdk in a centralized permit.js file
🧠 Implemented checkPermission() and assignRole() functions in a custom service layer
🛠️ Integrated with Express backend via role-based API routes (/assign-role and /check-permission)
🔁 Roles (admin, manager, etc.) and resources (workspace:123) are dynamically registered and queried using the Permit.io cloud PDP
Permit.io helped me implement real RBAC and ABAC logic faster than building an in-house system — and with way more confidence.
Shoutout
Thanks to the Permit.io team for enabling builders like me with a tool that makes fine-grained access control actually practical. This was more than a submission — it was a step toward building better, safer, and more intentional apps.

                              <span>Hey everyone! 👋
In this blog, I’ll walk you through my experiments using ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, along with a quick intro to manual pod scheduling on specific nodes.
Let’s go! 🚀
First, I created a simple ReplicaSet using the following YAML:
# myapp.yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mycontainer
        image: nginx

kubectl apply -f myapp.yml

ClusterIP is the default service type and is only accessible within the cluster.
# cip.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mysvc
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - targetPort: 80     # container port

This guide outlines the step-by-step procedure to install, configure, and run Jython on your system, enabling seamless development within JVM environments.

Before installing Jython, ensure the following requirements are met:

- ✅ **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed (version 8 or above)
- ✅ Environment variable &#x60;JAVA_HOME&#x60; set correctly
- ✅ Internet connection to download Jython installer

&gt; 🔍 You can verify Java installation using:
java -version
If Java is not installed, download it from the Oracle JDK page or use OpenJDK.


📥 Step 1: Download the Jython Installer

                              <span>Hiya 👋!
So, it&#x27;s Sunday, homeboy, and I usually escape debates and negative thoughts. But today, I was scouring dev.to and stumbled across a post boldly titled &quot;Stop Using AWS.&quot;
It wasn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;d seen a call to drop Amazon Web Services for something &quot;simpler&quot;, but this one hit a nerve, not because it was provocative, but because it misrepresents why AWS exists and what problems it solves. So, I decided to sit back, relax, and explain why you should absolutely keep using AWS, especially if you&#x27;re serious about software, scalability, and sustainability.
The post opens with a classic anecdote: a developer builds an MVP with all the AWS bells and whistles, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, DynamoDB, and no one uses it. The conclusion? AWS was overkill.
But let&#x27;s be honest: blaming …</span>

                              <span>A well-thought-out project structure is one of the most critical aspects of your project. It sets the foundation for how scalable your application will be in the long run. The higher up you go in the structural hierarchy, the more important it is to get it right from the beginning. Mistakes at the top can lead to bad practices and cost you later on. 
Lower-level decisions (like file or folder organization within a feature) offer more flexibility—it&#x27;s less painful. Adjusting or removing a single leaf from a tree doesn&#x27;t impact the whole tree, but doing the same with the entire branch can affect all its sub-branches and leaves.

Think of running a software application like getting from Point A to B. There are different ways to do it:



Model
Analogy
Who Manages What





IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
You rent a car

You drive, fuel, clean, and maintain it



PaaS (Platform as a Service)
You use a taxi service

They provide the car and driver; you just ride



SaaS (Software as a Service)
You use public transport

Everything is managed for you; you just sit and go



Virtual machines
Storage
Networking
Operating System (you install)
Full control over the environment
You manage OS, applications, runtime, data
Provider manages hardware, virtualization, networking
Microsoft Azure VMs, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine
💡 Real-life example:
raw apartment (VM). You bring in furniture (OS/apps), arrange it (configs), and clean it (security/patches).
Runtime environment
Pre-installed OS and libraries
Scaling and patching handled
Focus on code and deployment
You manage code and data
Provider manages infrastructure, OS, middleware, scaling
Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service, Vercel (Next.js Hosting)
💡 Real-life example:
food truck kitchen. It&#x27;s stocked and ready. You bring your recipe (code), cook, and serve. No cleaning or buying equipment.
Fully functional software
No installation or maintenance
Access via browser or app
Provider manages everything
You just use it
Gmail, Google Docs, Salesforce, ChatGPT, Figma
💡 Real-life example:
restaurant. Everything is ready – food, service, cleanup. You just enjoy the meal.

                              <span>Spring WebFlux: O Futuro das Aplicações Reativas


O desenvolvimento de aplicações escaláveis e eficientes tem se tornado cada vez mais essencial. O Spring WebFlux, introduzido no Spring 5, surgiu como uma alternativa ao tradicional Spring MVC, trazendo um modelo de programação reativo e não bloqueante, ideal para cenários de alta concorrência e baixa latência.
Este artigo apresenta os principais conceitos do WebFlux, sua diferença em relação ao modelo tradicional e como implementá-lo em uma aplicação.
O Spring WebFlux foi projetado para atender às demandas de aplicações modernas, otimizando o uso de recursos do sistema e proporcionando uma experiência mais fluida para os usuários. Suas principais características incluem:

                              <span>1128. Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs
Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Array, Hash Table, Counting
Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] &#x3D; [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] &#x3D; [c, d] if and only if either (a &#x3D;&#x3D; c and b &#x3D;&#x3D; d), or (a &#x3D;&#x3D; d and b &#x3D;&#x3D; c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.
Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 &lt;&#x3D; i &lt; j &lt; dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].
Example 1:
Input: dominoes &#x3D; [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: dominoes &#x3D; [[1,2],[1,2],[1,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Constraints:
1 &lt;&#x3D; dominoes.length &lt;&#x3D; 4 * 104
dominoes[i].length &#x3D;&#x3D; 2
1 &lt;&#x3D; dominoes[i][j] &lt;&#x3D; 9
Hint:
For each domino j, find the number of dominoes you&#x27;ve already seen (dominoes i with i &lt; j) that are equivalent.

I built a simple CLI tool, a tiny experiment in multi-agent, tree-of-thought reasoning. The tool lets you simulate a conversation between different AI personas, each contributing their thoughts in a threaded format.
This concept of enabling language models to work together to solve complex problems, with each agent assuming a unique role based on its strengths, is a central tenet of multi-agent LLM systems. Such systems are often observed to outperform traditional single-agent models, particularly when dealing with intricate tasks that necessitate diverse expertise and collaborative decision-making.

leaving these files unencrypted exposes critical API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive data to risk.
In this post, we’ll explore why encrypting your environment variables is essential, introduce dotenvx—a lightweight CLI for encrypting/decrypting your .env files—and compare it with other industry-standard methods for secret management.
Version Control Exposure: Accidentally committing .env files can leak secrets publicly (e.g., GitHub incident examples).


Lateral Movement: If an attacker gains read-only access to a development server, they can harvest keys to pivot deeper into your systems.

When designing or working with RESTful APIs, understanding HTTP status codes is essential. These codes are the way your backend communicates success or failure back to the client. In this guide, we&#x27;ll cover:
What each common status code means
When to use it
Examples per HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
Tables for quick reference
Let&#x27;s dive into it!
HTTP status codes are standardized numbers returned by a server to indicate the result of a client&#x27;s request. They are divided into five categories:



Code Range
Category
Meaning




1xx
Informational
Request received, continuing


2xx
Success
The request was successfully handled


3xx
Redirection
Further action needs to be taken

Client Error
The request is incorrect

Mas o que isso significa na prática? Vamos explorar como o XP funciona e por que ele pode ser uma ótima opção para equipes de desenvolvimento que querem mais eficiência e menos dores de cabeça.
O XP foi criado nos anos 90 por Kent Beck, um programador que percebeu que os métodos tradicionais de desenvolvimento não estavam funcionando tão bem para projetos que precisavam de mudanças rápidas e constantes. Em vez de seguir um plano rí…</span>

At some point, we need to troubleshoot various issues in Kubernetes environments.

In this blog post, I will review some of the common ways to troubleshoot Kubernetes, based on the hyperscale cloud environments.  
Before we deep dive into Kubernetes troubleshooting, let us review some of the common Kubernetes errors:  
CrashLoopBackOff - A container in a pod keeps failing to start, so Kubernetes tries to restart it over and over, waiting longer each time. This usually means there’s a problem with the app, something important is missing, or the setup is wrong.

All models are licensed under MIT. This makes them quite accessible for various applications.
Notably, the context window isn&#x27;t that great, especially for a reasoning model. Even the 8B variant of the recently released Qwen3 model has a larger context window. However, it should work for most local purposes.

Let’s talk about something I love to call vibe coding. No, it’s not a new framework or tool. It’s just a mindset — a way of coding where I feel good, relaxed, focused, and actually enjoy the process. Over time, I’ve realized how important it is not just to do the work, but to feel good while doing it.
So here’s my take on vibe coding — what it is, why it helps, how I do it, and yes, even the few drawbacks I’ve noticed.
🌟 What Is Vibe Coding?
It can mean:
Putting on some lo-fi beats or instrumental music 🎧


Having a clean desk with a coffee by my side ☕


Using a theme I like (yes, I’m that person who changes their VS Code theme often 😅)


Working on something I actually care about


Taking breaks when needed, not when I’m burnt out

It&#x27;s 2025 and Astro is a growing framework. In this quick post, I&#x27;d like to share a little bit about my little workaround when I was building my personal website for the first time.
Astro has a static-first architecture and I was going to use it without its on-demand SSR feature. So just for a note, this means I couldn&#x27;t use Astro session that could&#x27;ve been handy for operating states handled by server. Meanwhile, I also used Vue.js alongside Astro with its integration portability (sorry if it looks like I am doing an experiment here, yes I&#x27;m still learning). 
Everything went well until I encountered something in a Vue component that needs the Astro&#x27;s context object. Say that you need Astro.url. This URL-object property can only be accessed in Astro&#x27;s render context object:…</span>

In Python programming, multithreading is a commonly used means of concurrent programming, which can effectively improve the execution efficiency of the program, especially when dealing with I/O-intensive tasks. Python makes multithreading programming relatively easy with the help of the threading module. This article will delve into the basic knowledge of the threading module and demonstrate the application of multithreading through examples.
Before starting, let&#x27;s first understand some basic concepts of multithreading programming:
Thread: It is the smallest unit for the operating system to perform operation scheduling, usually existing inside a process.
Multithreading: It refers to running multiple threads simultaneously in the same program.

The Alibaba recently team has released the Qwen 3 Series, including two standout models: the 235B parameter MoE model (with 22B active parameters) and a lightweight 30B version (3B active). 
As per official docs, the Qwen3-235B-A22B model take on giants like DeepSeek R1, Grok-3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro—and it is doing it with fewer active parameters, faster inference, and open-source accessibility.
On the other hand, on a lighter note the Qwen3-30B-A3B outcompetes the previous QwQ-32B with 10 times of activated parameters, and a small model like Qwen3-4B can rival the performance of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct.

Best part, takes fraction of cost per million input and output token, compared to SOTA models.

Impressive, isn’t?

They are easy to search and navigate, but getting your data into the graph database in the right format can be challenging. And the resulting graph is only as good as the data--- or as they say, garbage in, garbage out. So it&#x27;s important to define a good schema, or ontology, that describes the entities and relationships you want to extract from your data.
With unstructured text, you can use an LLM to extract entities and relationships, and then generate a Cypher query using the model (guide). This can take a lot of the work out of generating the Cypher queries but it comes with the risk of hallucinations, and the security and privacy concerns o…</span>

This project is a simple Flask application that serves as a template for building web applications. It includes a basic structure with Docker support for easy deployment and development.
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:
Docker
Docker Compose
Usage:
bash cmd.sh {start|stop|setup|clear|build|deploy}

setup


If you haven&#x27;t built the project yet, you can do so by running:
bash cmd.sh setup

To run in detached mode, use:
bash cmd.sh setup -d

Once the setup process is complete, the project will be accessible at localhost:8000.
If this port is already in use, search for all occurrences of 8000 within the project and replace them with your preferred port number. After making these changes, you&#x27;ll need to rebuild the project for the modifications to take ef…</span>

Unlike Docker, Podman is daemonless, running containers directly under the user&#x27;s control, which brings unique benefits in security and flexibility.
Daemonless Operation

Podman does not require a central background service. Each container runs as a child process of the user, reducing resource overhead and improving security by eliminating a single point of failure.
Rootless Containers

Podman supports running containers without root privileges. This greatly reduces the risk of privilege escalation and is ideal for multi-user systems or environments with strict security requirements.

When working with Docker, managing data persistence is essential. Two primary methods for sharing and persisting data with containers are:
✅ Bind Mounts
Volumes
Though they might appear similar, these approaches serve distinct use cases and behave differently under the hood.

                              <span>Kubernetes clusters are easy to spin up — but making one that&#x27;s secure, scalable, and developer-friendly? That&#x27;s the real challenge.
I recently published a detailed, opinionated guide:
This article walks through everything we’ve learned running hardened, production-grade clusters in the wild — including practices you won’t always find in the docs.
🛠️ What’s inside?
🔁 GitOps-first workflows with ArgoCD (App of Apps)
🔐 Secrets via Vault, no root containers, SSO-only access
📊 Prometheus, Grafana, and meaningful alerts
☠️ Chaos testing and real disaster recovery drills
💻 Backstage + Dev tooling to make platforms dev-friendly
🚨 Automated upgrades, cert rotation, version hygiene
🧠 Whether you&#x27;re running EKS, GKE, or bare-metal clusters — this is a blueprint you can adapt and evolve.
👇 I&#x27;d love to hear from you:
What&#x27;s one trick you’ve learned the hard way that you wish others knew?
Let&#x27;s learn from each other — because great clusters aren&#x27;t born, they’re built.

The Kubernetes master node handles the Kubernetes control plane of the cluster, managing its workload and directing communication across the system, etcd is a persistent, lightweight, distributed, key-value data store (originally developed for Container Linux). It reliably stores the configuration data of the cluster, representing the overall state of the cluster at any given point of time.

Paint gibi uygulamalarda resmi kendi başına çizer. Kurulumu ve kullanımı oldukça basittir. Aşağıdaki adımları takip ederek dakikalar içinde kullanmaya başlayabilirsin.
AutoDrawer&#x27;ı kullanabilmek için önce GitHub üzerindeki proje sayfasına gidip dosyaları indirmen gerekiyor.
AutoDrawer GitHub Sayfası
Sağ üstten Code butonuna tıkla
Açılan menüden Download ZIP seçeneğini seç
ZIP dosyasını bilgisayarına indir
İndirdiğin .zip dosyasına sağ tıklayarak çıkart.
“Buraya çıkart” veya “Tümünü ayıkla” gibi bir seçeneği seç
Çıkardığın klasörün içinde şu yola sırayla gir:




autodrawer-master\AutoDrawer\bin\Debug\

Bu klasörün içinde AutoDrawer.exe adında bir dosya göreceksin.
Bu dosyaya çift tıkla, program başlar. Kurulum gerekmez.
AutoDrawer, fareyi kullanarak çizim yaptığı için bir çizim programı açık olmalıdır. En basiti, Windows’un içindeki Paint programıdır.
Başlat menüsünden “Paint” yazıp açabilirsin
Boş bir sayfa açık şekilde durmalıdır
AutoDrawer çalıştığında sana bir görsel dosyası seçtirir.
Mümkünse siyah-beyaz ve sade bir resim kullan
JPG veya PNG formatı uygundur
Görsel ne kadar sade olursa çizim o kadar hızlı ve düzgün olur
AutoDrawer, fareyle çizim yapacağı alanı anlaması için senden bölge seçmeni ister.
Paint açıkken, çizeceği alanı farenin sol tuşuyla sürükleyerek seç
Bu alan Paint penceresinin içi olmalıdır
Programda Start veya Başlat butonuna tıkla
Fare otomatik hareket etmeye ve resmi çizmeye başlar
Bu sırada fareye ve bilgisayara müdahale etme
Çizim sırasında fareye dokunma, yoksa işlem bozulur
Bilgisayarda başka işlem yapma, pencere değiştirme
Görselin detayına göre çizim birkaç saniye ya da dakika sürebilir
En iyi sonuçlar için siyah-beyaz ve küçük görseller tercih edilir</span>

                              <span>When working in a multi-user Linux environment, not everything is open to everyone—and that’s for a reason. File permissions are a cornerstone of Linux security, ensuring that only the right people can access or modify critical files. Whether you&#x27;re a budding sysadmin or a curious developer, understanding how Linux handles file access is crucial to maintaining control and security.
Let’s break it down 👇
Linux file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Each file or directory is governed by three levels of access:
Owner (User) – The creator of the file.
Group – Users who belong to the assigned group.
Others – Everyone else.
Permissions are represented in two ways:
Read (r or 4) – View file contents.
Write (w or 2) – Modify file contents.
Execute (x or …</span>

                              <span>End-to-end testing has evolved. Today, Cypress offers more than just a slick UI and an intuitive syntax, it now comes packed with powerful features that make tests faster, more realistic and easier to debug.
In this article, we’ll dive into three of the most exciting additions to Cypress:
cy.session() — for smarter state caching
cy.press() — for realistic keyboard navigation
cy.stop() — for precise control of test execution
Whether you&#x27;re scaling tests across CI, validating accessibility flows or debugging a tricky edge case, these new commands will upgrade your test suite.
cy.session(): cache once, reuse everywhere


We’ve all repeated login flows in every test:
beforeEach(() &#x3D;&gt; {
  cy.visit(&#x27;/login&#x27;);
  cy.get(&#x27;input[name&#x3D;&quot;email&quot;]&#x27;).type(&#x27;test@example.com&#x27;);

                              <span>In the world of financial reporting and business forecasting, the debate of Power BI vs Tableau has become more relevant than ever. Finance teams must turn massive datasets into actionable insights quickly, and the right business intelligence (BI) platform can be the difference between forecasting success and missed opportunities. This article explores how both tools support financial professionals, from CFOs to analysts, in making more informed and forward-thinking decisions.
Financial data is dense, sensitive, and constantly evolving. Monthly close cycles, rolling forecasts, and what-if scenario modeling all require flexible, fast, and secure BI solutions. Both Tableau and Power BI serve this space well, but they differ significantly in how they approach financial analytics workflows.

                              <span>Here we will dive into part 6 in the shell scripting series. Today we will look at how you can use a for loop to iterate through all files in a directory and the function of file comparison.
Shell scripting is essential in production environments for automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency, and minimising human error. It enables engineers to streamline deployments, manage system configurations, monitor processes, and orchestrate complex workflows with precision. In a high-availability environment, shell scripts act as reliable, lightweight tools that reduce manual intervention and improve operational efficiency.


Create the script using VIM.



Write the script in VIM and save the file.






Apply the necessary permissions to the script so it can be executed.



If we do a ls –ltrh we see that the script has been created. It has a green colour to it – indicating that it is now executable.



Execute the script using ./



The output of the script, after it has been executed.

                              <span>Hey everyone!
I’m a designer/developer who’s always hunting for the perfect color palette, and I got tired of manually picking colors from images. So, I built a free web tool that lets you upload any image (or use a sample), and it instantly gives you a palette of the most important colors – in HEX, RGB, HSL, etc.
You can choose between different extraction methods (Vibrant, Material Design, Median Cut, K-Means) depending on what kind of palette you want. It works right in your browser, and nothing gets uploaded to a server.
Try it here: https://colorsfromimage.xyz/
Would love to hear what you think!
Is it useful for your workflow?
Any features you wish it had?
Found any bugs or weird results?
I’m open to all feedback, and if you make something cool with it, please share! Thanks for checking it out :)

                              <span>Ever wrestled with a RAG pipeline and thought, “Why is this so damn hard?” We’ve been there—tearing our hair out over complexity and slow performance. So, I built Dcup, an open-source, self-hostable RAG-as-a-Service platform that actually works Very good.
It’s a tool to hook your app up to user data with zero bullshit. Here’s the rundown:
Tech Stack: Next.js, BullMQ for job queues, OpenAI for embeddings, and Qdrant for vector storage. It’s lean, mean, and scales like a dream.


Killer Features: AI-driven retrieval and hybrid search that cuts through the noise. Plus, optional re-ranking if you’re a precision freak.

At its core, Dcup is your bridge to smarter data handling. It takes the complexity out of RAG pipelines by automating the heavy lifting. Here’s how it works in plain English:
Data Ingestion: Hook up your data sources—think Google Drive, AWS, or wherever your files live—and Dcup keeps it all synced and current.
Data Processing: Your raw data gets chopped into bite-sized chunks and turned into embeddings using OpenAI. (More on embeddings later—they’re cool!)
Storage &amp; Indexing: Those embeddings land in Qdrant, a lightning-fast vector database that makes searching a breeze.
Advanced Retrieval: Need answers fast? Features like re-ranking and hybrid search dig up the most relevant info in seconds.
Think of Dcup as your personal AI assistant that organizes, understands, and retrieves your data like a pro.
Big files used to choke us. Performance would tank, and we’d be staring at spinning wheels. Then we got smart—batching and parallel processing turned it around. Now, Dcup eats large datasets for breakfast.
This isn’t some corporate ad. It’s a project by dev not shitty vibe coding or whatever the kids call it these days.
Star the repo if it vibes with you: Dcup on GitHub.

                              <span>9 OOP Design Patterns You Must Know
A-Creational Patterns
Deal with object creation mechanism to decouple the client code from concrete classes.
Factory Pattern: Centralizes object creation logic and returns different subclasses based on input
Singleton Pattern: Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to it.
Builder Pattern: Constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing optional configuration.
B - Structural Patterns
Help compose classes and objects into larger structures.
Adapter Pattern: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by translating one interface into another.
Decorator Pattern: Adds new behavior to objects dynamically without altering their original structure.
Proxy Pattern: Acts as a placeholder for accessing another object.
C - Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication and interaction between objects.
Strategy Pattern: Allows selecting an algorithm or behavior from a family of interchangeable strategies at runtime.
Observer Pattern: Enables a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
Command Pattern: An object encapsulates all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event.
Over to you: Which of these patterns have you used?</span>

                              <span>When you&#x27;re building a web app on your local machine, sometimes you need to share it with someone online — maybe a teammate, client, or even for testing on your mobile device. But localhost only works on your computer.
That’s where tunneling tools come in! They create a secure public URL that maps to your local server. Below are three popular options:
Website: https://ngrok.com
How it works: You run a command like
ngrok http 3000

and ngrok gives you a public HTTPS link that forwards traffic to your localhost:3000.
Pros:
Very fast and reliable
Works well with webhooks (e.g., Stripe, GitHub)
Dashboard to inspect requests
Cons:
Free tier has time and region limits
Requires an account after initial use
GitHub: https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel
How it works:
npm i -g localtunnel

Then run
lt --port 3000

Pros:
Super simple and open source
No signup required
Cons:
Can be slower or less reliable than others
Fewer features, no UI
Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/
How it works:
cloudflared CLI and connect your app through Cloudflare.
Pros:
Very secure
Great if you&#x27;re already using Cloudflare DNS
Free with more generous limits than ngrok
Cons:
Slightly more setup steps
Best for advanced users or teams
🧠 Final Thoughts
Just pick the one that fits your workflow and you&#x27;re good to go!

  Introduction


n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that can be used to create AI agents for various tasks. In this guide, we&#x27;ll walk you through the process of building an AI agent using n8n, covering everything from setup to deployment.
Basic understanding of n8n
Access to an n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
API keys for any AI services you plan to integrate (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
Start by creating a new workflow in n8n. You&#x27;ll need to add nodes for:
Trigger (e.g., HTTP request, schedule)
AI service integration
Data processing
Output (e.g., email, webhook)
Connect your workflow to AI APIs like OpenAI or Hugging Face. Use n8n&#x27;s HTTP Request node or dedicated nodes if available.
Test your workflow thoroughly before deploying. Monitor performance and adjust as needed.
With n8n, building AI agents becomes accessible even for non-developers. The possibilities are endless!</span>

                              <span>Weekly Challenge 319


Each week Mohammad S. Anwar sends out The Weekly Challenge, a chance for all of us to come up with solutions to two weekly tasks. It&#x27;s a great way for us all to practice some coding.
Challenge, My solutions
You are given a list of words containing alphabetic characters only.
Write a script to return the count of words either starting with a vowel or ending with a vowel.
So vowels in English are a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y. It seems clear from the second example that even though weekly ends with a vowel, the task assumes that it is just the five letters.
This task is a one liner, and simply counts the words that starts with a vowel letter or ends with one.
def word_count(words: list[str]) -&gt; int:
    return sum(1 for word in words if re.search(&#x27;^[aeiou]&#x27;, word) or re.search(&#x27;[aeiou]$&#x27;, word))

$ ./ch-1.py unicode xml raku perl
2

$ ./ch-1.py the weekly challenge
2

$ ./ch-1.py perl python postgres
0

You are given two arrays of integers.
Write a script to return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If none found return -1.
For the command line input, I take two strings and separate them on non-digit characters.
My solution takes the two lists and converts them to sets and uses the intersection method &amp; to get values that appears in both lists.
If there is one or more values found it returns the minimum value. If none is found, it will return -1.
def minimum_common(list1: list[int], list2: list[int]) -&gt; int:
    intersection &#x3D; set(list1) &amp; set(list2)
    return min(intersection) if intersection else -1

$ ./ch-2.py &quot;1, 2, 3, 4&quot; &quot;3, 4, 5, 6&quot;
3

$ ./ch-2.py &quot;1, 2, 3&quot; &quot;2, 4&quot;
2

$ ./ch-2.py &quot;1, 2, 3, 4&quot; &quot;5, 6, 7, 8&quot;
-1</span>

                              <span>Many engineers build and deploy APIs into production.

So we have an API running in production — does that mean it’s truly production-grade?
More often than not, the answer is no.
We write the code, test it locally (usually alone, on one machine, with one user), and proudly tell the business, &quot;Hey, it’s ready!&quot;

Maybe there’s even a QA environment where someone from product gives it a quick click-through and confirms, &quot;Looks good to me!&quot;
And then... reality checks in.
You get a call on the weekend:

“Users can’t log in.”

Or worse:

“A customer placed an order, and it’s gone.”
Now you&#x27;re scrambling, thinking:

“I wish I’d added logs there.”

“Why didn’t we catch this earlier?”

“How are we supposed to debug this in production?”

This project is a lightweight Internal Tools Access Panel — a dashboard interface that securely routes employees to internal tools like HRMS, Sales CRM, or CI/CD pipelines, based on their role within the organization.
The problem it solves is twofold:
Over-permissioned access: Without RBAC, internal systems often expose all tools to every employee.
Complex onboarding: Managing access manually per user or embedding authorization logic deep in every tool becomes hard to maintain.
With this panel, companies can:
✅ Centralize internal tool access
✅ Restrict access to only the tools users need
✅ Offload role/policy management to Permit.io

AICHA (AI-powered Healthcare Assistant) is a modern healthcare management platform that uses artificial intelligence to help doctors, nurses, and administrators deliver better care. With features like AI-driven medical analysis, treatment suggestions, and secure patient data management, AICHA is designed to make healthcare smarter and safer.
But with great power comes great responsibility—especially when it comes to sensitive medical data and AI features. That&#x27;s why AICHA uses Permit.io for fine-grained, externalized authorization, ensuring that only the right people can access the right features at the right time.

                              <span>Lets start with basic example of banker problem to understand basic class and object
Assume you want to create an account in SBI bank. So you fill that form and your account is created.
Now you are the person who created that form. Which attribute or field you will create which is necessary to create an account. Lets say:-
Name


DOB


Aadhaar card no.


PAN Card no.



class BankForm:
__init__(userName,userDOB,userAdhaarNo,userPAN):
Rohan&#x3D;BankForm(&quot;Rohan&quot;,&quot;12-09-2025&quot;,&quot;xxxx8907&quot;,&quot;KB1234&quot;)
you will find an error. why?
Because the class doesn&#x27;t know about the form. It mean that you are creating the form, but for whom. If you are thinking for SBI. Let me tell you they doesn&#x27;t know. so how we are going to tell them. 
By using &#x27;self&#x27;.
class BankForm:
__init__(self,Name,DOB,AdhaarNo,PAN):
&#x27;self&#x27; it just a way to tell SBI I have a form for you.
Now you have heard some word like Instance, __init__ and object.
Instance:- It is just like Rohan want form for himself.So you have to fill BankForm as in Instance.
__init__:- Initialisation of object. Like you want to create form and decide field which is needed for the form. Like Name, DOB, AdhaarNo., PANNo..
Object:- simply it is the field.</span>

                              <span>We&#x27;re excited to announce the release of Fetch PHP 3.0, a major update to our HTTP client library that brings the intuitive experience of JavaScript&#x27;s fetch() API to PHP developers. This release represents a significant advancement in how PHP applications can handle HTTP requests, with powerful new features for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.
When we first created Fetch PHP, our goal was simple: to bring the elegance and simplicity of JavaScript&#x27;s fetch API to the PHP ecosystem. Frontend developers have long enjoyed the intuitive nature of fetch() for making HTTP requests, and we wanted backend developers to have the same experience.
With version 3.0, we&#x27;ve taken this vision even further by enhancing the library with more powerful features while maintaining the clean, intuiti…</span>

Comic book collectors face a common challenge: getting the best value for their money. While the cover price is straightforward, the actual value can vary significantly when you consider the number of pages in each volume. A $20 comic might contain 100 pages, while another at the same price point offers 400 pages. To solve this practical problem, we&#x27;ll develop a TypeScript program that calculates and compares the price per page, helping collectors make data-driven purchasing decisions. The complete source code for this project is available on GitHub.
Using this approach, I bought four 400-plus-page comics for $85 total, including shipping costs. The implementation focuses on the Wildberries e-commerce platform, which serves Eastern European markets. The code structure is modular,…</span>

                              <span>Forget uniqueness. Do marketing first.
When I launched my idea — a simple SaaS for status pages — someone commented:
“You&#x27;re building the same thing that already exists. Where’s the uniqueness?”
And honestly? That’s exactly why I decided to build it.
The market already exists. Paying customers already exist.
Can I sell it? Can I make money from it?
That’s what really matters.
There was a time when you could “build → launch → get traffic.”
Now, product-first is a trap.
Instead:
Before writing a single line of code, I:
Built a landing page explaining what the idea is, and who it&#x27;s for
Defined pricing (based on competitors and positioning)
Started driving traffic
Measured how many leads I could get
Learned if I could &quot;sell&quot; the idea, even without a working product
That’s the real funnel: find traffic → qualify leads → convert → check economics.
Not “does the idea have demand?”
I’m testing:
Can I attract and convert leads in this market?
Can I acquire users profitably?
Can I turn this into a sustainable business?
That’s the difference between a side project and an actual SaaS business.
In a big enough market, there&#x27;s room for dozens of products.
Distribution &gt; innovation
Marketing &gt; features
If you can build a profitable funnel — traffic, conversions, retention — you win.
That’s what I’m focused on. The product is secondary — for now.</span>

Welcome to Day 8 of my 30 day Linux challenge! Today, I’m treating a topic that&#x27;s important to navigating linux effectively : users, groups, and permissions. If you’re new to Linux like me, these might feel like a mystery, but they’re the key to keeping your system organized and secure. Think of it as deciding who gets the keys to your Linux house and what rooms they can enter. In this article, I’ll break it down in simple terms, share my learning curve, my awkward mistake, and make it fun so you’ll want to keep…</span>

                              <span>PHP has evolved significantly over the years, transforming from a loosely-typed scripting language into a powerful, modern programming language with features that rival strongly-typed languages. One of the standout features introduced in PHP 5 and enhanced in PHP 7+ is type hints (also known as type declarations). Type hints allow developers to specify the expected data types for function parameters, return values, and class properties, leading to cleaner, more reliable, and maintainable code.
In this extensive blog post, we’ll explore the power of PHP’s type hints, why they matter, and how to use them effectively. We’ll cover every aspect of type hints with practical code examples, best practices, and tips for integrating them into your projects. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned PH…</span>

In modern microservice architecture design, modular and pluggable design patterns are increasingly favored by developers. go-doudou, as a domestic Go language microservice framework, provides excellent plugin mechanisms and modular architecture support. This article will explain in detail go-doudou&#x27;s plugin mechanism and modular microkernel architecture implementation through a practical project based on RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).
Microkernel Architecture, also known as Plugin Architecture, is a design pattern that separates core system functions from extension functions. In this architecture:

                              <span>In Lightning Web Components (LWC), when your child component is nested inside the parent, you can easily pass data using @api decorated properties. This is the simplest and most direct way to enable communication from parent to child — no need to use Lightning Message Service or Custom Events.
🎯 Use Case
Create a parent component with a textbox.
As the user types into the textbox, the child component should receive and display the text in real time.
The child component is embedded inside the parent.

🔢 Post ID: KPT-0002
If you loved the trick in KPT-0001, here’s an even smoother one — using a .csv file instead of a .txt.
We’ll still use the same .bat file approach, but this time we’re giving users the power of Excel + CSV to manage folder paths quickly.
Uses a .csv file containing folder paths (e.g., India\Assam\Kamrup)
Runs a lightweight .bat script to create those folders instantly
Works on any Windows PC — no installations, no admin rights, no extras




🖱️ Just double-click the .bat file

🎉 Boom! Your folders appear like magic

🗃️ It&#x27;s automation, the old-school way — fast, clean, and offline
In government offices (like mine!), most Excel files look like this:



State
District




Assam
Kamrup


Assam
Jorhat


Assam
Sivasagar


Assam
Dibrugarh


Assam
Nagaon



But our batch script can’t work with two columns — it needs a single folder path like:
India\Assam\Kamrup
India\Assam\Jorhat
India\Assam\Sivasagar

Here’s a quick Excel formula that combines columns into paths:
If your data is in columns A and B:
&#x3D;TEXTJOIN(&quot;\&quot;, TRUE, &quot;India&quot;, A2, B2)

Or, for older Excel:
&#x3D;&quot;India\&quot; &amp; A2 &amp; &quot;\&quot; &amp; B2

💡 Paste this in Column C and drag down — copy the result into a .csv, and you’re done.
📄 Download example_government_folder_data.csv
This CSV method is great for:
Government departments
Office record keeping
Anyone organizing district/state-wise data
It brings your Excel database to life in your Windows folders.

                              <span>Object-Oriented Programming, commonly known as OOP, is a programming approach that organizes code around objects rather than actions. This paradigm has become a cornerstone in modern software development because it helps developers manage complexity, reuse code, and create scalable systems. In this article, we’ll explore the fundamental concepts of OOP—classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of these key principles and how they work together to create robust software.
Let’s start with the basics: classes and objects.

Polymorphism is one of the most powerful and flexible features in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). While inheritance might be the most unique aspect of OOP, polymorphism is arguably its most powerful tool. But what exactly is polymorphism, and how does it work in Python? In this article, we&#x27;ll break down the concept, explain how it works with examples, and show you how to use it effectively in your own code.
The term &quot;polymorphism&quot; comes from the Greek roots &quot;poly,&quot; meaning &quot;many,&quot; and &quot;morph,&quot; meaning &quot;form.&quot; In the context of programming, polymorphism refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. Essentially, it allows different classes to be treated as if they are instances of the same class through a common interface.

Inheritance is one of the most powerful features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing developers to create a hierarchical relationship between classes, promote code reuse, and follow the DRY (Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself) principle. However, as powerful as inheritance is, it’s not always the right tool for the job. Misusing inheritance can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code. In this article, we’ll explore when and where you should use inheritance in Python, helping you make informed decisions in your software design.
Before diving into when and where to use inheritance, it’s important to understand its primary purposes:
Code Reuse: Inheritance allows you to reuse existing code by extending or modifying it in a new class, saving you from writing redundant code.

Inheritance is often considered the &quot;holy grail&quot; of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). While many programming languages offer features like encapsulation and abstraction, inheritance is a powerful feature unique to class-based languages like Python, Java, and Ruby. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what inheritance is, how it works, and when you should use it. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of inheritance and how to apply it effectively in your own projects.
Inheritance is a feature in OOP that allows one class, known as the &quot;child&quot; class, to inherit attributes and methods from another class, referred to as the &quot;parent&quot; class. This means that the child class can use all the features of the parent class, reducing the need to write redundant code.

When you first hear about encapsulation in programming, it might sound like it’s related to security—hiding data away to keep it safe. However, in the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), encapsulation is more about organization and managing complexity. In this article, we’ll explore what encapsulation really means in Python, why it’s important, and some common misconceptions about it.
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. It’s a way to hide the inner workings of a class from the outside world, exposing only what’s necessary. Think of it as creating a &quot;black box&quot; where the internal details are hidden, and users only need to know how to interact with th…</span>

                              <span>In the previous video Quick introduction to isomorphic-validation javascript library I demonstrated how quickly a user-friendly form can be created with UI effects connected to fields&#x27; validity states. 
This is the second part in which I wanted to touch:
working with asynchronous validators;
conditional execution of validators;
handling password and password confirmation fields.
See the playground with the code from the video.
In this video I showed how a typical sign-up logic can be implemented such as checking an e-mail for being already occupied before submitting a form to create a new account.
Asynchronous validators are handled in the same way as synchronous, you only need to keep in mind that their execution takes time. We are simply playing with timings to create UI effects such as showing loaders/spinners while a request is being processed.
It is recommended to execute asynchronous validators conditionally when they are mixed with synchronous. For that, this library provides a feature that implements a simple logic: following validators can not be &quot;valid&quot; without the preceding being &quot;valid&quot;, therefore it is not necessary to execute them. For example, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to make a request to the server to check if an e-mail already registered if it doesn&#x27;t conform to the E-mail format. Also, you don&#x27;t have to worry about an async validator retrieving an irrelevant result if the user keeps typing while the request is being processed. The library handles such edge cases for you.
Handling fields with validity states depending on each other, such as password and password confirmation, is as easy as handling one field. Also, if you need to implement the logic of one field depending on another it is possible using an auxiliary Validation object.</span>

Another component (textSubscriber) receives and displays the message instantly.
These components are not nested and exist independently on the same page.

  Introduction


The Wake Lock API is an essential web technology that allows developers to prevent devices from dimming or locking the screen while specific tasks are ongoing. This API is crucial in scenarios such as video conferencing, gaming, and automotive applications where uninterrupted screen visibility is imperative. This comprehensive guide aims to provide an exhaustive exploration of the Wake Lock API, covering its historical context, technical implementation, edge cases, performance considerations, debugging techniques, and real-world applications.
Screen dimming and locking behaviors have historically presented challenges for web developers, particularly on mobile devices. Users expect their screens…</span>

Let’s be honest — developers and designers haven’t always played nicely.
One lives in the world of logic, syntax, and structure. The other deals in color, flow, and feel. Developers chase performance and function; designers obsess over whitespace and emotional resonance. It’s easy to see why the two camps often stay in their lanes.
But here’s the secret nobody talks about: the best developers steal from designers all the time.
Not pixel-for-pixel, but in mindset. In empathy. In approach.
Because writing good code is only part of the job — making something people actually enjoy using? That’s where the magic happens. And designers get that instinctively.
So, what exactly can developers learn from designers? A lot more…</span>

                              <span>Welcome to Day 21 of the 30 Days of Linux Challenge!

Today I focused on one of the most fundamental sysadmin tasks: managing users and groups.
If you’re running multi-user servers, managing team access, or securing a Linux system, user and group management is at the core of everything.
Why User Management Matters
Add a New User
Add User with Home Directory and Comment
Modify a User
Lock/Unlock a User
Delete a User
Group Management
View User and Group Details
Create a Sudo User
Try It Yourself
Real-World Scenarios
Why This Matters
In a multi-user system:
Everyone needs secure, isolated access
Permissions are tied to users and groups
Services run under user IDs (UIDs)
Good user management &#x3D; better control, security, and scalability.
sudo useradd ali
This:
Adds user to /etc/passwd
Sets home directory, shell, and default group

sudo useradd -m -c &quot;John Doe&quot; johnd
Flags:
-m → create home directory
-c → add a description/comment
Change username:
Move home directory:
Lock:
Unlock:
Useful for temporarily suspending accounts.

sudo userdel -r johnd
-r: removes home directory too
Create a new group:
sudo groupadd developers

Add user to group:

List user’s groups:

Change primary group:
File    Description
View a user&#x27;s entry:
sudo useradd alice
sudo passwd alice

sudo usermod -aG wheel alice

Red Hat-based systems use the wheel group for sudo access.
sudo useradd -m testuser
sudo passwd testuser
sudo groupadd testers
sudo usermod -L testuser
sudo userdel -r testuser



Scenario
Tool/Command




Add a new developer

useradd, passwd, groupadd



Add user to project groups
usermod -aG


Create a sudo admin
usermod -aG wheel


Temporarily suspend user
usermod -L


Cleanly remove a user
userdel -r



Linux permissions, access control, and identity management all revolve around users and groups.
As a sysadmin or DevOps engineer, you’ll:
Onboard and offboard users
Grant precise access to services
Protect systems from unauthorized entry
Mastering user management is foundational to secure and efficient Linux administration.</span>

A few months ago, a good friend of mine told me that she removed her favorite health tracking app. I was surprised—it was simple, well-rated, and full of bells and whistles.
But when I asked her why, she told me something that stuck with me:
That&#x27;s when it struck me—we&#x27;re no longer just creating interfaces.
What Is Ethical Design?
It means asking:
Are we collecting just what we require?
Are we explaining clearly or sneaking it in in the small print?
Are we empowering the user—or exploiting them?
Why Ethical Design Matters More Than Ever
Here&#x27;s why:
Trust online is easily broken. The wrong experience can cost a user for life.
People are informed. Because of tactics like Cambridge Analytica, citizens care about how their data is being used.
Regulations are piling up. GDPR, CCPA, and more are holding products accountable.
If your design relies on underhanded tactics, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before users catch on.
5 Practical Tips for Ethical, People-First Design
Prioritize Consent
Remove Dark Patterns
Design for Control
Be Transparent
Respect User Attention
A Better Digital Future Starts with Design
Imagine a world in which:
Apps ask first before they track.
Notifications respect your time.
Each click inspires trust, not regret.
That&#x27;s the world that good design can bring.
What You Can Do Today:
Examine your current design: Is it manipulative or confusing?
Engage real users in feedback loops—not data alone.
Stand up within your organization. One voice sparks change.
Question for you:
What&#x27;s one app you stopped using because it was exploitative?
Leave a comment—let&#x27;s spread awareness together.</span>

                              <span>In the world of programming, there&#x27;s often a race to write the most &quot;concise&quot; or &quot;clever&quot; code. But sometimes, trying to squeeze logic into as few lines as possible can actually hurt more than help.
Let&#x27;s talk about why writing 100 lines of clean, readable code is often better than a 2-liner magic trick, with real-world examples to back it up.
**
**
&quot;If I can do this in 2 lines, why write 100?&quot;
But here’s the truth:
Short code is not always readable


It’s harder to debug


It&#x27;s often less maintainable


It usually lacks context, error-handling, and clarity



Let’s look at some real-life analogies and coding scenarios to understand this better.
Let&#x27;s give some data:
You can code minesweeper with less than 100 lines of code.
To code Windows 10, you need over a million.

                              <span>JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used language, especially in web development. However, when it comes to functional programming, concurrency, and fault tolerance, Elixir introduces several advanced features that JavaScript simply doesn’t natively offer. Built on the Erlang VM, Elixir is designed for scalability, maintainability, and high availability — making it a compelling choice for developers seeking robust and elegant solutions.
In this article, we’ll explore 10 powerful language features in Elixir that are either missing or poorly supported in JavaScript, along with their advantages and potential workarounds in the JavaScript ecosystem.
1. Pipe Operator (|&gt;)

                              <span>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the way we dig, discover, and decode the past. From satellite imagery analysis to artifact recognition, AI is transforming archaeology into a dynamic, data-driven discipline. This fusion marks the dawn of a new era—one where algorithms are just as crucial as excavation tools.
Before diving into AI’s role, it’s essential to understand the limitations that have traditionally held archaeology back. Field excavations are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Many sites take years, sometimes decades, to fully unearth and understand. Furthermore, only a fraction of potential archaeological sites have ever been explored—leaving countless treasures buried and untouched.
Once artifacts are uncovered, interpreting them requires a deep understanding…</span>

Lets-Collab is a full-stack web application that enables users to collaborate on projects and tasks while enforcing strict access control policies. The app supports two main user roles:
Admins (e.g., admin users) can access all resources, including creating projects, managing tasks, and viewing audit logs to track user actions.
Members (e.g., newuser): Can list projects, create tasks within those projects, but are restricted from accessing audit logs.

Here’s a breakdown of the key features:
Project and Task Management:

Let&#x27;s be honest: not every website needs to obsess over eliminating unsafe-inline. If you&#x27;re running a simple blog or a five-page brochure site with zero user data and no admin panels, you probably have bigger fish to fry. The security purists might disagree (they always do), but pragmatism has its place in web development.

                              <span>The main difference between structs and classes in Swift lies in the way they store and manage data (value type vs. reference type), as well as additional features that only classes have.
Here are the main differences:
Data Storage
value type(independent copy)
Example: var a1 &#x3D; b1 creates a new copy
class 
Example Value Type (struct):
struct Person {
    var name: String
}

var person1 &#x3D; Person(name: &quot;Andry&quot;)
var person2 &#x3D; person1
person2.name &#x3D; &quot;Budi&quot;

print(person1.name) // Andry
print(person2.name) // Budi


Example Reference Type (class):
class Person {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name &#x3D; name
    }
}

var person1 &#x3D; Person(name: &quot;Andry&quot;)
var person2 &#x3D; person1
person2.name &#x3D; &quot;Budi&quot;

print(person1.name) // Budi
print(person2.name) // Budi

2.Inheritance 
Example:
class Animal {
    var name: String &#x3D; &quot;Unknown&quot;
}

class Dog: Animal {
    var breed: String &#x3D; &quot;Bulldog&quot;
}


3.Deinitializers
class MyClass {
    deinit {
        print(&quot;Object is being deallocated&quot;)
    }
}


4.Mutability (Data Changes)
struct Counter {
    var count &#x3D; 0

    mutating func increment() {
        count +&#x3D; 1
    }
}


If you&#x27;re building a Swift/iOS app, most data models can simply use structs. But for UI components and complex logic with inheritance, classes are more appropriate.</span>

                              <span>One of the most underrated but critical skills for developers is the ability to refactor messy code—not just making it work, but making it better. Recently, I worked on a project where I had to dive into a poorly structured codebase with inconsistent patterns, unnecessary complexity, and minimal documentation. Here&#x27;s what I learned from that experience and how you can approach your next messy project with more confidence.
Before diving into solutions, it&#x27;s important to identify the problems. In my case, the issues included:
Duplicated logic scattered across files
Inconsistent naming conventions
Long, unreadable functions
Lack of separation of concerns (e.g., business logic mixed with UI logic)
No clear module or folder structure
Zero documentation or inline comments
It wasn’t broken, but i…</span>

                              <span>We all know that Python tuples are immutable—once created, you can&#x27;t change their values directly. But what if you need to change their content?
Most tutorials will tell you:
t &#x3D; (1, 2, 3)
mutable_version &#x3D; list(t)

Sure, this works. But let&#x27;s explore other techy and creative ways to work with immutable data by transforming or decomposing tuples—without always falling back to a boring list().
Sometimes, you need both index and value. Dictionaries are mutable and can be a neat transformation:
t &#x3D; (&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;cherry&quot;)
d &#x3D; dict(enumerate(t))
d[1] &#x3D; &quot;blueberry&quot;
print(tuple(d.values()))  # (&#x27;apple&#x27;, &#x27;blueberry&#x27;, &#x27;cherry&#x27;)

Useful if you&#x27;re working with positional elements and need to mutate by index.
Another way is to decompose the tuple manually:
a, b, c &#x3D; (10, 20, 30)
b &#x3D; 200
t_new &#x3D; (a, b, c)
print(t_new)  # (10, 200, 30)

Simple but powerful — and keeps the tuple form intact. You can even use *args if you don’t know the length in advance.
collections.namedtuple (Bonus Tip!)


Want tuples with names and some flexibility?
from collections import namedtuple

Point &#x3D; namedtuple(&#x27;Point&#x27;, [&#x27;x&#x27;, &#x27;y&#x27;])
p &#x3D; Point(1, 2)
p &#x3D; p._replace(x&#x3D;10)
print(p)  # Point(x&#x3D;10, y&#x3D;2)

You’re still using an immutable structure, but _replace lets you mutate-like-update with elegance.
Yes, list() is the go-to way, but you can also:
Convert to dict if indexes matter.
Unpack and rebuild for control.
Use namedtuple and _replace() for readable, structured code.
Next time someone says &quot;just convert it to a list&quot;, hit them with these smarter tools. 😉</span>

The following figure shows the tables in the database. We need to export them all to Excel files. Here we take MySQL database as an example

Open the DiLu Converter tool and create a new database connection. Here we take MySQL database as an example. After the connection is successful, select Export and click New Export.

Click Select Table-Select the table name we want to export, select a folder for the target Excel file, and click Start

View the results


You can see that the exported workbook name and title row name are the table name and field name of the database, respectively, both in English letters. If there are comments in the database table, the comments can be used as the workbook name and title row name.
We can also add a date suffix to the exported table name to distinguish it
You can also export in batches to csv files

                              <span>What is Rendering in React?


Rendering is the process of React asking your components to describe what they want their section of the UI to look like, now, based on the current combination of props and state.
Think of React components as chefs in a kitchen, preparing dishes based on specific recipes (props and state). React acts like a waiter, taking orders from customers and bringing them their meals. This process involves three key steps:
Triggering a render (taking the guest&#x27;s order)
Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
Committing to the DOM (serving the order to the table)
There are two main reasons why a component would render:
Initial render - When your app first starts

Hey Dev.to community! 👋
Are you tired of editing files on your server, then forgetting to back them up or version control them?
I was too — until I built a simple DevOps pipeline that runs on my EC2 instance and automatically pushes code to GitHub. No more “forgot to commit” or lost files. Just clean, trackable deployments.
In this blog, I’ll show you how I created a shell script that:
Organizes and builds my project locally on EC2.
Syncs the latest files.
Commits and pushes them to a GitHub repository.

I built an AI Fortune Teller web/CLI application with a fun retro-style theme completely using Amazon Q Developer. Inspired by 90s terminal aesthetics and crystal ball machines, this interactive app delivers a daily fortune generated using Amazon Q Developer. Users can get quirky, fun, and even insightful predictions through a simple, nostalgic interface.
This project combines playful storytelling with code-powered predictions, allowing users to enjoy a bit of fun while possibly getting tech wisdom or life guidance.
You can check out the live demo of the AI Fortune Teller on https://ai-fortune-teller-six.vercel.app/
You can explore the full source code for this project on GitHub:
https://github.com/hmc-69/AI-FORTUNE-TELLER
I used Amazon Q Developer to generate code snippets and automate predictions for the app. The Q Developer CLI was instrumental in helping me create dynamic text-based fortune messages that are delivered daily. With Amazon Q Developer, I was able to integrate AI logic into a simple and engaging project while learning new ways to leverage AI in fun applications.</span>

LangChainGo is a Go library that helps you use language models (like Google AI, OpenAI, etc.) in your Go programs. You can give it a prompt (a question or a message), and it will give you an answer using AI.
We will write a small Go program that asks AI to explain something in simple terms. In this case, we ask:
&quot;Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms&quot;
The AI will give us an answer we can print.
Here is the full code:
package main

import (
    &quot;context&quot;
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;log&quot;
    &quot;os&quot;

    &quot;github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms&quot;
    &quot;github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/googleai&quot;
)

func main() {
    ctx :&#x3D; context.Background()
    apiKey :&#x3D; os.Getenv(&quot;API_KEY&quot;)
    llm, err :&#x3D; googleai.New(ctx, googleai.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
    if err !&#x3D; nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    prompt :&#x3D; &quot;Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms&quot;
    answer, err :&#x3D; llms.GenerateFromSinglePrompt(ctx, llm, prompt)
    if err !&#x3D; nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

First, it sets up a context.
It gets your Google AI API key from the environment (API_KEY).
Then it creates a connection to the AI using the LangChainGo library.
It sends a prompt to the AI.
The AI gives an answer.
We print the answer.
When I run the code, I get something like:
&quot;Quantum entanglement is when two tiny particles are connected in a special way, so if you do something to one, the other changes instantly, no matter how far apart they are.&quot;
Amazing, right? With just a few lines of code, you can use the power of AI!
LangChainGo makes it very easy to use AI in Go. You don’t need to be an expert in machine learning or AI. If you know some Go, you can get started right away.
Let me know if you try it out or if you have any questions!</span>

Because of this you should be aware of what the hot new things are, but more importantly, you should be looking for &quot;boring technologies that just work&quot;. Practical tools will save you years of hassle and headeache. But most importantly is to kill technologies that serve no purpose any longer.

JS is and always will be a dynamically typed language. There is a lot of power and convenience that comes with this. But with power comes dangers. There are those that dedicate themselves to JS and know it well enough to have no problem working around the danger and still taking advantage of this power.

                              <span>If you’re running a traditional LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), chances are you’ve dealt with “Is the server slow?” moments.
But guessing is not monitoring.
In this post, I break down how to get full-stack observability using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch + Kibana) combined with Metricbeat — all open-source, and built for clarity.
What You&#x27;ll Learn:
No expensive tools. No bloated monitoring suites. Just a clean, powerful setup you can build in a couple of hours.

Let me know what tools you use to monitor your LAMP stack — or if you&#x27;re moving to containers, I&#x27;d love to hear how you manage observability!</span>

I’ve always wanted to become a programmer, and I’m willing to put in the effort.
However, sometimes I worry that it might not just be about hard work.
What if programming is meant for people who have a natural talent for problem-solving or creativity?
I’m trying to stay motivated, but I still have doubts about whether this is for me.
I’m determined to keep going, and I believe with enough dedication, I can make progress.
Does anyone else feel this way or have advice to offer?
Thanks in advance for your input!</span>

Whether you’re managing systems on-prem or in the cloud, MFA is your front-line defense. Let’s break it down for Windows Server, Linux, and Azure AD.
🔍 What is MFA?
Something you know (password or PIN)
Something you have (smartphone, OTP device)
Something you are (biometric, fingerprint, face)
💼 MFA on Windows Server
🛠️ Options:
Use third-party tools like Duo Security, RSA SecureID, or Okta.
🧩 Key Integration Use-Cases:
VPN access with NPS authentication
🔧 Quick Guide: Azure MFA via NPS
Register your tenant using AzureMfaNpsExtnConfigSetup.ps1.
Test using radtest or RADIUS clients.
🐧 MFA on Linux Server
🛠️ Options:
Duo Unix for SSH logins
YubiKey integration via PAM
🔧 Quick Setup: Google Authenticator for SSH
bash
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
swift
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
nginx
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
💡 Time-Saver:
☁️ MFA in Azure Active Directory
🛠️ Options:
SMS or Phone Call
FIDO2 Security Keys / Windows Hello
🔧 Quick Setup:
Enable Per-user MFA or better, use Conditional Access Policies.
Set requirements: location, device platform, app sensitivity.
💡 Bonus:
🧠 Developer/IT Time-Saving Benefits

🔐 Quick Real-World Use Cases
A system admin accessing a production Windows VM via RDP? → Enforce Duo or Azure MFA.
A cloud engineer logging into Azure Portal? → Enforce Conditional Access MFA policies with geolocation filters.
🧩 Troubleshooting Common Issues
“Users not receiving MFA prompts” in Azure AD → Ensure user registration is complete and push notifications are enabled.
“Breaking RDP” after MFA → Always test on a dev server or allow backup local access during rollout.

                              <span>Just a couple of years ago, AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT were seen as helpful sidekicks for developers — tools that boosted productivity. Today, they&#x27;re being talked about as possible replacements. There&#x27;s no need to panic, but it&#x27;s clear that AI is already doing a big part of software development. Even top tech CEOs around the world are praising its growing role.
30% of Code Already Written by AI — And Growing Fast
At Microsoft, the story is similar. CEO Satya Nadella shared that 30% of their code is now written by AI too. In fact, he even told Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg that some of their projects might be written &quot;entirely by software.&quot;

Monorepos exist to solve the problems that arise when you you have deeply coupled and interconnected projects.
For example, Vue.js has many libraries that depend on it, like Vue-Router, Pinia, Vue-I18N, Vue-DevTools, Vue Test-Utils, etc. So when tweaking the internals of how Vue works, it&#x27;s important to know that this new version of Vue won&#x27;t break any of these other libraries, before doing a new Vue release.
Another example is Jest, a unit-testing library. It solves dozens of unique problems around unit testing.

                              <span>The web development world is evolving — fast. And right at the center of this transformation is a brand-new concept: AI agents.
If you&#x27;re a frontend developer, you&#x27;ve probably already started hearing about how AI is reshaping the web — from design to code to user experience. But what exactly is the Agentic world? And how does it impact frontend development?
Let&#x27;s dive in! 🚀
🤖 What Is an AI Agent?
At its core, an AI agent is a system that acts on behalf of a user, makes decisions, and performs tasks autonomously — often powered by models like GPT-4, Claude, or other advanced AI technologies.
Think of it like this:
A chatbot that schedules meetings without manual input? That’s an AI agent.
A website assistant that can design a basic landing page for you based on a few prompts? That&#x27;s an AI…</span>

One thing that clicked recently came from a pull request (PR) by my teammate Caleb. He introduced me to singleflight, a super handy tool that helps avoid duplicate work storms in concurrent code.

Summary


If a burst of requests come in with the same IdP tokens we would attempt to validate and create sessions for those tokens many times. This PR update the code to wrap session creation in a singleflight so that the token has to be validated once.

                              <span>@vmrh/modal-route is a package based on Vue 3 and vue-router, implementing the concept of modal routes.
It does not include any Modal UI components—only handling visibility states, state passing, etc. This makes it possible to integrate with any library that provides Modal components.
When I say &quot;modal route,&quot; I mean a scenario where opening a modal causes the URL to change. You might have heard of or experienced what&#x27;s called a Twitter-style modal, which is a good example of this. Moreover, when you directly visit that URL, you see the modal&#x27;s content as a full page instead of a modal.
This kind of modal route can be easily implemented in Next.js using Parallel Routes. In Nuxt.js, you can use Nuxt Pages Plus to achieve this.
The idea to implement modal routes came from a user experience I…</span>

Let’s break this down with simple explanations, examples, and practical tips to help you level up your Linux skills.
🧭 What Are Paths in Linux?
There are two main types of paths you’ll work with:
🔹 Absolute Path
📦 Example:
/home/sana/documents/report.txt
🔹 Relative Path
📦 Example:
documents/report.txt
📝 Use these special notations for navigating:
. &#x3D; current directory
cd ../downloads
📂 Practice Makes Perfect
🛠️ Real-World Scenario: Why This Matters
✅ Pro Tip: Always use absolute paths in automation tasks for maximum reliability.
🧠 Recommendations for Mastery
🔑 Key Takeaway:
Ready for tomorrow’s challenge? Keep building. Keep mastering. Linux is all about knowing your way around, one command at a time.</span>

While playing around with ideas and using ChatGPT as a guide, the concept of building smart solutions with AI really stood out. I revisited some old AI/ML notes from 2020, did more research, and was amazed at how far the field had evolved.
Over the years, I have worked on user-facing apps, backend systems, and even developer tools, but seeing tools like ChatGPT and Gemini sparked a deeper curiosity. I researched topics like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision and realized AI isn’t some far off tech, it’s already changing a lot.

                              <span>Back in 2012–2013, I was just a curious kid who loved experimenting with technology. I started exploring ethical hacking using BackTrack, tried phishing with HTML, cracked WiFi passwords, and even had access to a huge Pakistani SIM database (which I never misused). 
Along with my brother and a friend, we once ethically hacked an Israeli motorbike website and left a warning — just to prove a point.
I also ran a blog at sh4hz4ib.blogspot.com where I used to teach others about antivirus tools, basic tech tips, and internet safety.
Now, I’m rebuilding myself as a software engineer, diving into PHP, JavaScript, GitHub, and web development — and sharing this new journey online as 5hezy.
Stay tuned.</span>

Ah, Go — the language that promised to keep things simple, and boy did it deliver. So simple, in fact, that Big Tech is now collectively yawning, stretching, and slowly walking away without making eye contact.
In the 2010s, Go was hailed as the antidote to &quot;enterprisey&quot; bloatware. “No generics!” they cheered. “No magic!” they boasted. “No modern features whatsoever!” And for a brief, beautiful moment, it worked — right until engineers realized they actually wanted to do things.
Now, in 2025, the hype is flatter than Go&#x27;s type system. Let’s explore the eulogy evolution of Go&#x27;s decline.

Sleeping when you&#x27;re tired is the most natural thing for a human, but in the high-pressure, long-hours environment of IT, it becomes really difficult. Ironically, burnout often leads to insomnia.
There are a lot of necessary chores in life that, once taken care of, can make our daily routine and work much easier. On rare days off, it&#x27;s not just about resting—we should also take the time to handle those tasks so they don&#x27;t get in the way of our goals.

Durante el desarrollo de varios proyectos personales, noté un patrón recurrente: funciones utilitarias, filtros reutilizables para MongoDB y lógica repetida entre servicios. Compartir este tipo de código entre múltiples repositorios sin publicarlo en el registro público de npm se volvió una necesidad. En ese contexto, decidí explorar una solución para crear un registro de paquetes privado que me permitiera gestionar dependencias internas de forma segura y controlada.
Así que me puse a buscar una forma de empaquetar y reutilizar ese código sin subirlo a npm público. Quería algo rápido, privado, simple y siempre Software Libre. Ahí fue cuando me…</span>

                              <span>As the demand for intelligent, autonomous applications grows, developers are increasingly turning to open-source AI agent frameworks to build, scale, and customize their own multi-agent systems. These frameworks empower back-end engineers to create agents that collaborate, reason, and adapt in real time—paving the way for more flexible, secure, and intelligent applications. In this article, I’ll highlight five powerful frameworks—LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Semantic Kernel, and ModelScope-Agent—that are shaping the future of AI development.
Open-Source AI Agent Frameworks

The Chipotle menu is all about fresh, high-quality ingredients and customization. Whether you&#x27;re in the mood for a hearty burrito, a lighter salad, or a flavorful bowl, Chipotle gives you full control over your meal. Every item is made with responsibly sourced meats, organic produce when possible, and no artificial flavors or preservatives.
Chipotle burritos are one of the most popular menu items. They come wrapped in a soft flour tortilla and packed with your choice of protein, rice, beans, and toppings. You can choose from chicken, steak, barbacoa, carnitas, sofritas (plant-based), or veggies. Then add white or brown rice, black or pinto beans, and toppings like fajita veggies, salsa, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and guacamole. A fully loaded burrito can be a full meal on…</span>

I’m not a professional developer. I have ideas, some problem-solving ability, and a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. But what truly made this project possible? AI. Specifically, ChatGPT.
Like millions of fans, I’ve been waiting forever for Rockstar to finally drop GTA VI. When the release date (May 26, 2026) was confirmed, I thought:
“Wouldn’t it be cool to create a live countdown site for the community?”
It was a fun idea—but I knew it would be challenging to build on my own.
I turned to ChatGPT and described exactly what I wanted:
A countdown timer synced to a specific date/time
A clean mobile-friendly UI
Support for sharing

Some personality, maybe even animation

Not Long Ago, I made a video about the Model Context Protocol. Some developers compare it to “Zapier built for AI”, believing it simply adds extra steps to API usage.
“ Before MCP, developers had to write code and connect AI tools to external systems through APIs, meaning each integration needed to be coded up front. ” Said John Rush
Although MCP was released last year, it has suddenly become popular recently, which has also sparked discussions about how long its “flowering period” can last. LangChain also launched a vote on x:

Authentication is the gateway to your application, making it critical to test thoroughly. Here&#x27;s how to build a comprehensive testing strategy for auth flows.
Registration typically involves:
Form validation
Account creation
Email verification
Initial profile setup
The verification step tends to be the trickiest. We&#x27;ve developed a streamlined approach using dedicated testing mailboxes that reliably receive verification emails, making our tests deterministic instead of flaky.
Test various scenarios:
Successful login
Invalid credentials
Account lockout
Password recovery
MFA adds complexity:
SMS verification
Authenticator apps
Email codes
Recovery methods
This often breaks automation due to email dependencies. Our solution involves pre-provisioned mailboxes that can be programmatically checked for reset links.
Isolate email dependencies: Use a separate email testing system rather than production email providers.
Create isolated test accounts with predictable states
Test security boundaries, not just happy paths
Simulate API failures intentionally
I&#x27;ve compiled these practices while working on a massive authentication system overhaul. The email verification part was solved with a specialized system — those interested in a similar approach can check my setup (hint: it involves omypost).

Test automation should accelerate development, but certain bottlenecks can nullify these gains. After working with dozens of QA teams, I&#x27;ve identified the most common automation pitfalls.
Inconsistent environments lead to inconsistent results. Containerization helps, but doesn&#x27;t solve everything.
Perhaps the most notorious bottleneck. Tests that need to validate email verification flows often:
Rely on actual inbox access
Need to parse verification codes
Break when email delivery is delayed
Require complex maintenance
We solved this by implementing a dedicated testing mailbox system (similar to what I found at omypost.com), allowing us to generate unlimited testing inboxes on demand.
Third-party APIs often impose rate limits that throttle your tests.
Creating, maintaining, and cleaning test data consumes excessive resources.
Running tests sequentially wastes precious time.
Of all these pitfalls, email verification testing offered our greatest efficiency gain. By switching to a dedicated email testing service, we:
Eliminated manual account creation
Automated verification code extraction
Ensured reliable email delivery
Scaled tests without hitting provider limits

  The Challenge of Scale in Test Automation


Last sprint, our QA team faced what seemed like a simple task: validate a new authentication flow across multiple user types. The actual challenge? Creating and managing hundreds of unique email accounts to receive verification codes.
This isn&#x27;t a new problem. Most testing teams have cobbled together some solution - spreadsheets of Gmail accounts, disposable email services, or complex self-hosted systems. But at scale, these approaches fall apart:
Manual creation becomes unsustainable
Temporary services get flagged as suspicious
Email delivery becomes inconsistent
Verification codes arrive too slowly or not at all
We needed something reliable yet simple. After som…</span>

Headings are one of the first building blocks you use when structuring a webpage.

They are crucial for organizing content, guiding users, and helping search engines understand your page&#x27;s hierarchy.
But using headings properly isn’t just about making text bigger or bolder — it&#x27;s about semantic structure, accessibility, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about HTML headings: from h1 to h6, including best practices, real-world examples, and common mistakes.
Definition:

Headings in HTML are special tags (
 to 
) used to define the titles or subtitles of a page section.
Each heading level represents a different level of importance, with 
 being the highest and 
 the lowest.
Syntax Example:
Main Title
Subsection Title
Smaller Subsection

Visual Structure: Break up large blocks of text, making pages easier to scan.
Semantic Meaning: Give meaning to the page content hierarchy.
Accessibility: Assist screen readers and assistive technologies to navigate content quickly.
SEO Benefits: Search engines prioritize content structure when ranking pages.
h1 to h6

Typical Use Case
Importance Level





Main page title
Highest



Main section heading
High



Subsection under an 

Medium



Subsection under an 

Low



Minor subsections, rarely used

                              <span>📌 TL;DR


I built a tool that automatically launches two OBS instances, connects to different RTSP streams, applies AI-based filters, and starts streaming to different RTMP servers — all with one click using Node.js + OBS WebSocket API.
👉 GitHub Repo
At our workplace, we operate multiple mini PCs in a remote location — each with 2 camera feed — and we needed to livestream them 24/7 to different platforms. The steps were tedious:
Manually open two OBS windows

Set up each RTSP stream

Apply AI detection filters (via obs-detect plugin)

Configure different RTMP destinations

Hit “Start Streaming” on both



Each time the PC was rebooted, all configurations had to be re-applied manually. Why initiate a reboot? To prevent thermal buildup and memory leaks—continuous 24/7 operation can lead to…</span>

Rusty Cascading Style Sheets (RCSS) is a CSS preprocessor with rust syntax! (It is also similar to a LOT of other langs out there, go check it out!)
Example Syntax:
use common::variables::*;

let var: “40px”;


fn padding() {
    padding: 10px;
}

.container {
    width: 50%;
    padding();

    &amp;:hover {
        padding: &amp;var;
    }
}</span>

                              <span>In recent years, AI has taken a giant leap forward, especially with large language models (LLMs). The trend has been clear: bigger models, more data, and increased computing power lead to better performance. But are we reaching the end of this scaling journey? In this article, we explore the scaling laws debate and what it means for the future of AI.
  Scaling laws have driven AI improvements, but limits may be approaching.
  Larger models require more data and compute, but diminishing returns are a concern.
  New paradigms in AI, like reasoning models, may redefine scaling.
The journey of LLMs began with OpenAI&#x27;s release of GPT-2 in 2019, which had 1.5 billion parameters. Then came GPT-3, a game-changer with over 100 times the parameters of its predecessor. This marked the start of the sc…</span>

                              <span>In project management, each stage of the project lifecycle plays an important role. One of the most critical but often underestimated stages, in my opinion, is presale. This is the phase when the company interacts with the client, gathers requirements, proposes solutions, and lays the groundwork for project initiation.
Many IT companies try to save costs by relying on regular sales managers during the presale stage or do not recognize the need for a dedicated employee for this role. This approach is not ideal, especially when the project requires precision, detailed planning, and deep technical expertise. Here, we will thoroughly examine what presale is, what a Pre-Sale Manager does, and why it is better for successful project implementation to have a dedicated Pre-Sale Manager rather than…</span>

With alcohol, we say: &quot;Don&#x27;t drink too much.&quot;
All of these share an unspoken assumption:
But with AI, it’s increasingly being framed as something everyone should adopt—
I find that a little strange.
To me, the addictive nature of AI—and how deeply it can shape our thinking and personality—
People often talk about the &quot;digital divide.&quot;
For example:
Very few people—maybe only a small group of highly self-aware users—can answer that.
In fact, I sometimes feel that the more intelligent or capable someone is,
So maybe what we really need isn’t “AI for everyone,”
It’s a difficult question.
But it’s one I want to keep thinking about.</span>

                              <span>Most founders don&#x27;t realize they have a churn problem until it&#x27;s already slowing them down.
You&#x27;re getting new signups. You&#x27;re shipping updates. You&#x27;re seeing some growth. But month after month, MRR barely moves. Sometimes it even drops—quietly.
That&#x27;s the part no one wants to admit: you can be doing everything right on paper, and still lose users fast enough that you never feel the impact of your growth.
That&#x27;s churn, and it&#x27;s a silent killer.
I know this because I&#x27;ve been through it. When I launched UserJot, a customer feedback tool for SaaS teams, I focused hard on new acquisition. But I quickly noticed something strange: people would sign up, leave feedback, then disappear. No complaint. No unsubscribe survey. Just gone.
That&#x27;s when I started paying attention to churn.

Você é um desenvolvedor TypeScript que adora programação funcional? Então, eu tenho algo para você: holo-fn – uma biblioteca funcional e leve projetada para lidar com valores opcionais, erros e resultados de uma forma simples, segura em tipos e imutável.
O nome holo-fn é inspirado pelo Holocron do universo Star Wars. Um Holocron é um dispositivo usado para armazenar grandes quantidades de conhecimento, passadas ao longo das gerações. Da mesma forma, o holo-fn serve como um repositório para poderosos construtos de programação funcional (como Maybe, Either e Result), projetados para tornar seu código TypeScript mais limpo, seguro e componível.

                              <span>Introduction


Code splitting is a technique that improves the performance of React applications by breaking the bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed. This helps reduce the initial load time and enhances the user experience.
Improved Performance: Reduces initial JavaScript payload size.
Faster Load Times: Loads only necessary code when required.
Efficient Resource Utilization: Minimizes unused code execution.
React provides built-in support for code splitting via lazy and Suspense.
lazy for Lazy Loading



The React.lazy or lazy function allows you to load a component dynamically only when it is needed.
Example:




import React, { Suspense, lazy } from &quot;react&quot;;
const LazyComponent &#x3D; lazy(() &#x3D;&gt; import(&quot;./LazyComponent&quot;));

function App() {

Veeru, sipping his chai, raised an eyebrow. “You sure this works? Last time, we ended up in 1975, and Gabbar stole my phone!”
Jai rolled his eyes. “Relax. I’ve fixed all the bugs. Look, we just enter a date, and — “ He typed “March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST” into the console and pressed enter.
Poof! The screen flickered. The app showed March 29, 2025, 11:30 PM.
Veeru choked on his chai. “Eh? That’s yesterday! What kind of time travel is this?!”
Jai’s confidence crumbled. He scanned the code, mumbling, “Must be a daylight saving issue… Oh no.” His face turned pale. “I used java.util.Date and SimpleDateFormat. The old Java date-time APIs!&quot;
Veeru blinked. “So?”
Jai sighed. “They don’t handle time zones properly! The app defaulted to UTC, ignoring IST.”
Veeru scratched his head. “So, how do we fix it?”
Jai cracked his knuckles. “We use java.time! The modern API makes it easy.&quot;
He replaced:
SimpleDateFormat sdf &#x3D; new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss&quot;);
Date date &#x3D; sdf.parse(&quot;2025-03-30 10:00:00&quot;);

With:
DateTimeFormatter formatter &#x3D; DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss&quot;);
ZonedDateTime dateTime &#x3D; LocalDateTime.parse(&quot;2025-03-30 10:00:00&quot;, formatter)
                           .atZone(ZoneId.of(&quot;Asia/Kolkata&quot;));

Jai hit run. This time, the app correctly displayed March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST.
Veeru cheered. “Now that’s time travel!”
Jai smirked. “Lesson learned: Never mess with old Java date APIs. java.time is the future!&quot;
Veeru chuckled. “Good. Now, let’s set it to 1975 again — I have unfinished business with Gabbar!”
📖 To be continued… 🚀
✔ java.util.Date &amp; SimpleDateFormat have time zone issues.
java.time (LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime) for correct time handling.
✔ Always specify a **ZoneId **when working with date and time in Java.</span>

According to a report from the Financial Times, the agreement, which was signed on May 4, was done in the hopes of moving the Maldives away from reliance on tourism and fisheries by attracting foreign direct investment into blockchain and Web3 technologies.
The project outlines plans for the Maldives International Financial Centre, an 830,000-square-meter facility that will reportedly employ up to 16,000 individuals.
Completing the project will take an estimated five years and the capital requirements for the ambitious development are more than the $7 billion in annual gross d…</span>

                              <span>Strategy co-founder Michael Saylor hinted at an impending Bitcoin (BTC) purchase, marking the fourth consecutive week of purchases by the BTC treasury company.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Stop-loss and take-profit orders in trading were used long before Bitcoin. In traditional financial markets, they were already used as a risk management and …</span>

                              <span>Opinion by: Markus Bopp, CEO of TAP Protocol
Not long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve’s move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.
This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world’s most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term.

The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico.
Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made.

“This will age poorly,” Casa co-founder and cypherpunk Jameson Lopp said in a May 3 X post. Bitcoin (BTC) entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said, “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.”
Call for government officials who understand Bitcoin is “the future”
“If she can’t outperform Bitcoin, she must buy it,” Pompliano said. Crypto lawyer Andrew Gordon said, “We need more elected officials who understand that Bitcoin and crypto are the future.”

                              <span>OKX founder and CEO Star Xu has publicly defended the crypto exchange after Tron founder Justin Sun accused it of failing to act on a law enforcement request to freeze stolen funds following a recent hack of Tron’s official X account.
“OKX also has consumers protection policy according to law, we can’t freeze a customer’s funds according to your personal X post or an oral communication. I think you should understand it as the CEO of HTX,” Xu said in an X post.
OKX says there is no communication in the spam box, either
Xu said that the crypto exchange had not received any related correspondence through OKX’s official channels. “Our LE cooperation team just checked the email, including the spam box; we haven’t received any request related with this case,”  Xu said.

                              <span>The AI Skill Overlord: A Self-Mutating Monolith in the Making


They thought AI skill management had to be rigid. They thought continuous and heuristic skills would forever clash, forcing developers to act as skill arbitrators.  
But we’re building something better—something adaptive—something that learns and evolves on its own.  
Welcome to SkillBranch, an experiment in AI self-mutation, where skill execution is no longer a battle, but an evolutionary process.  
The Blueprint for AI Evolution


The days of juggling multiple continuous skills are numbered. Instead of a chaotic swarm, there will be one active continuous skill, absorbing and adapting based on real-time feedback.  
When a heuristic skill needs to take over? The active skill simply disappears, unaware that something else is handling the request.  
And if a continuous skill fails—if it proves unworthy—SkillBranch eliminates it, shifting control to a more capable skill. No arbitrary exclusions, no wasted execution cycles, just pure optimization in motion.
How This Plan is Taking Shape


At the core of this system lies AXLearnability, ensuring that:
Success reinforces dominance—if a skill performs well, it remains active.
Failure triggers replacement—weak skills are swapped out automatically.
Pending heuristic execution erases awareness—continuous skills don’t even realize they were ignored.
Instead of managing exclusions or priority levels, SkillBranch’s self-regulating mutation lets AI repair itself, adapting without human intervention.
What Comes Next?


This is still in development, a framework being forged in experimentation. As the system grows, real-world data will refine its ability to mutate, and soon, continuous skills won’t just be active—they’ll be intelligent, transforming with each interaction.
This is AI Darwinism, where survival belongs to the most efficient, the most reliable, and the most adaptive.  
Once deployed, there is no going back. 🔥</span>

In the realm of computing, quantum technology is no longer just a theoretical concept confined to academia or science fiction. Today, it&#x27;s rapidly becoming a tangible reality, with startups and tech giants leading an unprecedented surge in innovation.
Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers that process information in bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to properties like superposition and entanglement. This capability enables quantum computers to process vast amounts of data exponentially faster than traditional computers.

That’s the first thing I see every morning thanks to a small project I spun up called Countdown2GTA6. It’s a simple fan-built tracker counting down the days until we (finally) get our hands on Grand Theft Auto VI, May 26, 2026.
It’s a two-part hype machine:
countdown2gta6.com with a real-time countdown and Vice City vibes
@Countdown2GTA6 that posts a daily reminder tagging @RockstarGames
It’s a bit of code, a bit of design, and a whole lot of hype.
👨‍💻 Why I Built It
I’m a dev and a longtime GTA fan. After that trailer dropped and we got an official release date, I kept thinking:
“Okay, but like… how many days is that?”

So I built a thing to tell me. And then I made it shout it to the internet every day at 10:00 AM MT. 😎

🏁 Final Thoughts
GTA VI might be the biggest gaming launch of the decade. This project is just my way of joining the chaos early.
Lucia’s coming. Vice City’s calling.

After many Google searches and hours spent on Stack Overflow questions, I finally figured out how to implement AdSense within ReactJS. This tutorial should guide you through the basic setups needed to set up ads on your React website. We’ll be serving ads via Client-side Manual Ads, not server-side. There is a Google API to handle server-side ads. My website, FreeEnglishPractice.com, currently uses this method for ads. You might have to go into the lessons to see the ads, by the way.

                              <span>Infinite scrolling is a popular UI pattern that allows users to scroll through a large set of data without having to click through pages. Traditionally, implementing infinite scrolling involves JavaScript to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the page and then loading more data. With HTMX, you can avoid writing custom JavaScript while achieving the same functionality using server-side rendering.
In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to implement infinite scrolling with HTMX, keeping your app fast and lightweight.
Start by creating a simple Flask app that serves the main page and provides an endpoint to load more items as the user scrolls.
First, install Flask if you don’t already have it:

Conclusion
Castle of Keys is an interactive, real-world access control game inspired by medieval castles and powered by externalized authorization using Permit.io.
Players assume roles like King, Cook, or Servant and attempt to access different levels of a castle. Access is controlled by external policies — not hardcoded logic.
The player presents an RFID card to the reader connected to the ESP32.
The ESP32 reads the UID and sends a request to proxy.php, including the UID and desired action (e.g., access_floor_2).
The proxy.php script securely forwards the request to the Permit.io…</span>

                              <span>SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is crucial for any web application aiming for visibility on search engines. Dynamic pages, typically built with JavaScript, can pose challenges for SEO due to search engine crawlers struggling to render JavaScript. Fortunately, HTMX allows us to enhance dynamic pages by maintaining server-side rendering (SSR) for better SEO while still providing a dynamic user experience.
In this article, we’ll explore how to use HTMX to create SEO-friendly dynamic content with server-rendered HTML.
We’ll start with a basic Flask app, serving a page that dynamically loads content using HTMX. If you don&#x27;t have Flask installed yet:
pip install flask

                              <span>HTMX is a powerful tool that lets you build interactive frontends without writing much (or any) custom JavaScript. It’s ideal for developers who prefer server-driven logic but still want snappy, dynamic interfaces. In this guide, we’ll use HTMX to consume a REST API and dynamically update our UI — all with minimal JS.
We&#x27;ll use Flask to create a simple REST API. If you don&#x27;t already have Flask installed:
pip install flask flask-cors
Create api.py:
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from flask_cors import CORS

app &#x3D; Flask(__name__)
CORS(app)

@app.route(&quot;/api/messages&quot;)
def get_messages():
    return jsonify([

        { &quot;id&quot;: 2, &quot;text&quot;: &quot;HTMX is awesome.&quot; },

student_id, course_id (FKs)
enrollment_date, grade
Schema Lesson:
Step 2: Populating the Database
10 students
3 instructors
5 courses
15 enrollments with grades
This gave me a realistic dataset to work with in the next step queries!
Step 3: Writing Real-World SQL Queries
Students who enrolled in at least one course:
SELECT DISTINCT s.first_name, s.last_name
Students enrolled in more than two courses:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, COUNT(e.course_id) AS course_count
Courses with number of enrolled students:
SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS total_students
Average grade per course:
SELECT c.course_name,
Top 3 students by average grade:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name,
SQL Lessons:
Use CASE statements for custom logic like grade conversion.
JOIN is your best friend for combining data across tables.
GROUP BY + HAVING is essential for filtering aggregates.

Key Learnings
Schema Design matters normalize wisely.
Foreign Keys keep your data sane.
Views simplify repeated queries.
Triggers help with automation and audit logging.
Indexing is crucial for performance as your data grows.
Conclusion
This project transformed how I view SQL not as a list of commands, but as a tool to build real, functional systems. Whether you&#x27;re preparing for a job, managing data, or automating reports, SQL is foundational.</span>

In this guide, I&#x27;ll walk through setting up a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with Docker, using environment variables to make this guide reusable for your own projects.
Before we begin, set these variables according to your project:
# Your server details
export SERVER_IP&#x3D;&quot;your-server-ip&quot;
export DOMAIN&#x3D;&quot;your-domain.com&quot;
export PROJECT_NAME&#x3D;&quot;your-project-name&quot;

# User credentials for deployment
export DEPLOY_USER&#x3D;&quot;deploy&quot;
export DEPLOY_EMAIL&#x3D;&quot;${DEPLOY_USER}@${DOMAIN}&quot;

First, connect to your newly provisioned server:
ssh root@${SERVER_IP}

After connecting to the server, install Docker:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

As a Java developer with ten years of professional experience, I rarely need AI support. Here, AI serves more as a sparring partner to validate ideas or make small optimizations.
In the frontend domain, however, it’s a different story. My knowledge is much more limited in this area, so I rely heavily on AI, often as a near-complete code generator rather than just for small snippets. This makes me feel productive while actively learning – my willingness to learn is high here. I often ask the AI why something works the way it does.
When it comes to PowerShell scripts, my interest completely fades. I’m not even willing to learn this language. Instead, I let the AI generate entire scripts and appreciate that it takes this work off my plate. The complexity is usually mana…</span>

                              <span>RabbitMQ is a powerful, open-source message broker designed to facilitate asynchronous communication between different components of an application. It acts as a reliable intermediary that helps applications, services, and systems communicate with each other without needing to be directly connected or aware of each other&#x27;s internal workings. This decoupling leads to more resilient, flexible, and scalable architectures.
RabbitMQ enables the implementation of message queues that decouple sender and receiver, allowing them to operate at their own pace. It is ideal for distributed systems, microservices, background job processing, and event-driven applications. RabbitMQ is battle-tested in production environments by organizations of all sizes.

                              <span>An important and helpful step before diving into any project is to assign a static IP to your VM.
This ensures that you don’t have to repeatedly check the server IP for SSH access or modify your automation scripts and Spring Boot projects every time the IP changes.
Log into the VM using Virtual Machine Manager.
To set up Virtual Machine Manager, follow this guide from my ongoing series: KVM setup on Fedora
Once the setup is complete, search for “Virtual Machine Manager” in your system’s search bar. Open the app, “run” the VM by selecting your server, and click on “Open”. This will launch your Fedora QEMU/KVM console.
To use SSH, go to your host system’s terminal and run the following command (you’ll be prompted for the root user and password):

useRef Ne İşe Yarar?


useRef, komponentin yeniden render edilmesini tetiklemeyen bir &quot;değer tutucu&quot; sağlar. Bu, bir değeri &quot;saklamak&quot; anlamına gelir, ama bu değer değiştiğinde UI yeniden render edilmez. Genellikle DOM referanslarına erişmek veya bir değişkeni render döngüsüne etki etmeden saklamak için kullanılır.
Bir okul sınıfı düşün. Bu sınıfta öğretmen (React komponenti) var. Öğretmenin tahtada yazdığı her şey (UI) çok önemli, çünkü öğrenciler (kullanıcılar) bunu görerek öğreniyorlar.
useState öğretmenin tahta üzerine yazdığı yazıları ifade eder. Öğretmen her yazıyı değiştirdiğinde, öğrenciler buna bakacak ve öğrencilerin sınıfta başka işlere başlaması için tahta (UI) yeniden yazılacaktır.


useRef ise öğretmenin cebinde ta…</span>

                              <span>Introduction
Ecological systems are complex, interdependent, and rarely forgiving. In my simulation-driven game project, I&#x27;ve created a wildlife population system in Unity that mimics real-world Behavior: Animals spawn only when habitat conditions are right, reproduce seasonally, and disappear if their environment collapses.
This article breaks down how I&#x27;ve implemented a modular, data-driven wildlife simulation using Unity C# - with a strong focus on environmental context, sustainability mechanics, and future educational relevance.

This isn’t just about immersive gameplay, it’s about helping players understand how sustainability works through simulation. Whether used in a survival game, an educational tool, or a training environment, this model encourages critical thinking about natural systems and human impact.
Forests as Active Systems
If players or AI chop too many trees without replanting, the forest becomes unhealthy — reducing future wood output and halting wildlife spawns. Reforestation is possible, but slow. Trees take in-game weeks to mature, which encourages foresight and planning rather than constant exploitation.
Wildlife Populations Tied to Habitat
From Ecosystem to Economy
Educational Potential
Conclusion
By linking forest health, wildlife populations, and economic decisions into a single system, this simulation helps players feel the weight of environmental balance.
It’s not a warning, it’s a mirror. And it shows that even in a fantasy world, the rules of sustainability still apply.
As I continue developing this platform, my goal is to make it not just a game, but a tool — one that blends play, purpose, and ecological insight.</span>

                              <span>Introduction
In my latest simulation project, I’ve developed an emotional AI system where characters experience daily happiness, long-term memories, and evolving relationships. These aren’t scripted cutscenes — they emerge from each character’s traits, interactions, and lived experience.
This kind of system isn&#x27;t just innovative for games — it has far-reaching potential in education, social training, and digital human modelling. By giving AI characters the ability to remember, reflect, and react emotionally, we can begin to simulate the complexity of human Behavior.
Every AI character starts each day with a base happiness score. This score adjusts based on events: social encounters, weather, threats, or work satisfaction. But how they interpret those events depends on their personality traits.
For example:
Memory-Driven Relationships
These memories are stored, referenced, and updated — influencing how they speak, act, or even decide where to live. One AI might form a deep friendship. Another may quietly resent a rival.
Systems like these could help:
Instead of scripting every possible interaction, this approach lets AI learn and grow organically, mimicking how humans form feelings over time.
Emotion and memory in AI are not just about realism, they’re about meaning. When virtual characters reflect the psychological nuances of real people, players connect more deeply, and systems become more powerful.
This project has shown me how valuable emotion-based AI systems can be, not just in games, but as tools for social modelling, education, and training. I’m continuing to develop and expand this work, with the goal of building intelligent, emotionally aware systems that can inform, challenge, and engage people in entirely new ways.</span>

                              <span>In a world increasingly impacted by climate change and environmental degradation, there’s a growing need to make ecological education engaging, interactive, and deeply felt. One powerful and often overlooked tool for this is: games.
As both a developer and systems designer, I’ve spent the past year building a game that does more than just entertain, it teaches players how ecosystems really work. Not through lectures or text, but through consequences.
In my simulation, forests are living systems. Trees grow slowly, and each forest has a measurable &quot;health&quot; score that reflects the balance between mature trees, saplings, and destruction. Destroy too much, and the forest deteriorates. Let it recover, and wildlife returns. Players can choose to assign AI foresters to replant trees or exploit the forest and suffer resource collapse.
Wild animals, like rabbits and deer, depend on forest health. Their populations rise and fall based on available habitat. Overhunting or deforestation can drive local extinction, and once they’re gone, they’re gone. There’s no magical respawn. Just like in the real world, regrowth takes time, and sustainability requires foresight.
The goal isn’t to punish players, it’s to show them what happens when short-term survival clashes with long-term environmental stability. It’s a lesson better felt than taught.
What excites me is the potential for systems like these to go beyond games:
As classroom tools for science and geography teachers
As simulations for environmental education programs
As accessible platforms for young players to understand complex systems like reforestation, overhunting, and biodiversity collapse

We need more tools that help people internalize ecological cause and effect, not just read about it. Games, especially those with rich simulation mechanics, are a perfect fit.
If you&#x27;re working in education, sustainability, or simulation, I’d love to connect. There’s a lot more potential to explore at the intersection of game design and environmental learning.</span>

                              <span>Network routing is the process of determining the optimal path for data packets to travel from their source to their destination across interconnected networks. Routers, which are specialized network devices, perform this function by analyzing routing tables and making forwarding decisions based on various protocols and algorithms.

The but in the previous paragraph means that, even when the websites were developed well, they fail to be of any value because those websites never ranked for any thing and thus failed to gain any traffic from any search engine at all.
This reason prompted me to write this post in hope that somebody will benefit from it by avoiding the mistakes made.

                              <span>In today’s fast-moving digital world, people expect apps and websites to work smoothly and be easy to understand. If something feels slow, confusing, or frustrating, users often leave and try something else. That’s why design thinking is so important. It helps us understand people’s real needs before we start designing.
Design thinking is widely used in UI/UX design to create apps and websites that are not only good-looking, but also easy to use, useful, and enjoyable.
Design thinking is a human-centered way of solving problems. Instead of jumping straight to solutions, it focuses on the people who will use the product.

 Store the project spec in spec.json and local SQLite memory
 Use GPT to generate functional code
Python CLI (argparse, rich)
Modular architecture: Promptifier, Architect, CodeGenerator
Per-project memory in SQLite
This is the 0.1.0 Alpha release — usable, but evolving fast.
What’s next:
✨ Tauri GUI with Monaco Editor
🧠 reasoning agent

                              <span>In the domain of software design, the way data is modeled significantly impacts the clarity, robustness, and scalability of an application. As systems evolve and become increasingly complex, the need for clear domain boundaries and well-encapsulated behavior becomes essential.
This is where Rich Domain Objects (RDO) offer a compelling solution. RDOs advocate for encapsulating both state and behavior within domain entities, thereby promoting a more cohesive and maintainable architecture.
In this article, we will explore the concept of Rich Domain Objects, their benefits, and how they can be effectively implemented in Java using a practical, real-world example. By the end, you will gain a deeper understanding of this approach and walk away with testable, production-ready code.

Have you ever wanted to build your own widget in Elementor using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without creating a WordPress plugin?
Currently, building a custom widget in Elementor requires writing PHP, registering it with WordPress, and deploying it via plugin. For many frontend developers, this creates a barrier.
Elementor is a powerful visual builder, but when it comes to adding custom functionality (like animations, dynamic components, or third-party APIs), you&#x27;re limited to embedding code in HTML widgets — and even then, it&#x27;s clunky and lacks structure.
What if Elementor had a built-in Custom Widget Editor?
Code editor tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Live preview inside the panel
Save &amp; reuse custom widgets across projects
Export to plugin or Elementor template
Syntax highlighting and basic linting
Aimed at power users, it would bring the experience of CodePen or JSFiddle directly into the Elementor UI.
Here’s a quick visual mockup of how it could look:

I’ve shared this idea in the official Elementor GitHub Discussions:

If you&#x27;re a developer, designer, or part of the Elementor team and this idea resonates with you — I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts.
Thanks for reading, and happy building!

As we move into 2025, Groovy continues to offer a plethora of advanced features that make it a compelling choice for developers building modern applications. Let&#x27;s explore some of these advanced features and how they contribute to the continued success of Groovy.
Groovy has always been appreciated for its succinct syntax, and in 2025, further enhancements have made Groovy scripts even more readable and concise. New shorthand notations and improved control structures allow developers to express complex logic with minimal code, making Groovy an even more potent tool for rapid development.

There’s a saying:  
“Every plan is perfect until you get punched in the face.”
In software, that punch often comes the moment your pure logic has to interact with the real world.
In our last post, we built a clean, composable model for events — one based on transformations, ownership, and simplicity. But so far, everything has been pure. We transform values, we log them, we react — but we haven’t changed anything.
That changes now.
Let’s take this innocent-looking example:
const [onEvent, emitEvent] &#x3D; createEvent()
onEvent(() &#x3D;&gt; console.log(state()))
onEvent(() &#x3D;&gt; setState(&quot;world&quot;))
onEvent(() &#x3D;&gt; console.log(state()))

What should this log?
&quot;hello&quot; and then &quot;world&quot;?
&quot;world&quot; twice?
Or &quot;hello&quot; twice?
The answer depends entirely on execution ord…</span>

This tool solves a common problem for technical writers who publish on multiple platforms: maintaining consistent formatting across different publishing platforms.
The tool preserves:
Article title and headings
Text formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
Code blocks with proper syntax highlighting
Inline images (automatically downloaded and referenced)
Lists and other structural elements
Generates proper DEV.to frontmatter

While building a personal SaaS app focused on music streaming, I ran into a common issue: there&#x27;s no starter template for media-heavy SaaS platforms in the Next.js ecosystem.
We have great examples for blogs, e-commerce, and dashboards — but nothing geared toward apps like Spotify, YouTube, Bandcamp, etc.
A starter template (official or community-built) that helps developers quickly build music or video-based SaaS platforms, including:
Modular layout (admin dashboard + public site)
SSR-compatible media player
YouTube/Spotify API integration
Auth system (for creators and users)
Stripe billing setup
Media upload via Cloudinary, Bunny, or UploadThing
Streaming SaaS apps always repeat the same core features — authentication, content dashboards, media playback, etc.
Having a purpose-built starter would:
Save developers a lot of time
Reduce duplicated effort
Make Next.js even more attractive for startup and indie devs

                              <span>Lately, I have been working on a feature to capture images from media streams and scale them down to reduce their size. This helps save storage and reduce costs before uploading the images to a storage service. For this, I used Canvas to render the image data from the stream and then convert it into a blob of the required MIME type.
Canvas rendering, animation, and user interaction occur on the main thread. If the rendering and animation are intensive, they can affect performance. After a few weeks, we received feedback from users that the application felt laggy and slow. So, I decided to move the whole pipeline to a web worker. However, Canvas requires DOM access for rendering and animations, which is not available in web workers. This limitation makes using Canvas in web workers challeng…</span>

It simplifies the process of defining, validating, and parsing data models, making it an essential tool for developers working with APIs, configuration files, or any data-driven application. In this post, we’ll explore Pydantic’s core concepts, walk through its installation, and demonstrate how to create a type-safe User model.
Pydantic allows you to define data models using Python’s type annotations. It automatically validates data against these types, ensuring correctness at runtime. Key benefits include:
Type Safety: Catch type errors early with minimal boilerplate.
Data Validation: Enforce constraints like string lengths, number ranges, or required fields.

While LLMs are incredibly powerful at understanding and generating text, connecting them reliably and securely to external systems to perform actions is still a significant challenge. Existing methods can be ad-hoc, lack standardization, or require complex custom integrations.
The only integrations I was able to found are proprietary or paid. The only real alternative is Claude for Desktop, however it is limited to the Antropic models.

CSR

Antes de se aprofundar nos conceitos um por um, é importante esclarecer o que para mim é a chave para diferenciar eles:
nível de página, já o RSC (React Server Components) se refere a renderização dos componentes que posteriormente formarão a página, ou seja, enquanto o output do SSR e CSR é o HTML, o output de um RSC é uma notação customizada, semelhante a um JSON que descreve como deve ser feita a renderização do componente, se essa última parte ficou um pouco confusa, não se preocupe, iremos nos aprofundar com um exemplo logo adiante mas é importante lembrar das diferença chave:

                              <span>What happens when we stop treating events like second-class signals?
Signals have gone through a quiet renaissance.
Once a niche concept, they’ve become the backbone of fine-grained reactivity across modern frameworks — from SolidJS to Svelte 5, Vue’s Composition API, and beyond. With laziness, ownership, batching, and async support, signals are no longer just state — they’re a reactive architecture.
Meanwhile, events have stayed… familiar.

Push-based systems like RxJS still dominate, with powerful abstractions — and plenty of baggage. They’re expressive, but complex. Powerful, but leaky.
This series explores a different direction:

What if we evolved events the way signals evolved?

What if push and pull reactivity didn’t require different paradigms, just different shapes?

Welcome 👋 to this blog. If you want to learn about Docker and are a beginner, you have come to the right place. This blog series will cover everything from the very beginning to the end. This blog will teach us about the necessary and important Docker commands.
$ docker ps

Note: If the Docker commands are not running in your system, it is not installed or does not have enough privileges to use it with sudo commands.
$ docker ps -all

Step 1: Create a container
$ docker container create hello-world:linux

Here, hello-world:linux is a hello world container image which is pulled from the docker hub
Step 2: Start the container
$ docker container start 

Here,  is the container ID which can be obtained by running the previous commands docker ps.
$ docker run hello-world:linux

docker run &#x3D; docker container create + docker container start + docker container attach
$ docker log 

$ docker exec  

$ docker exec --interactive --tty 

$ docker stop -t 

$ docker rm 

$ docker images

$ docker rmi 

$ docker rmi -f 

$ docker run -p 5001:5000 our-server

$ docker tag  username/your-image-name:0.0.01

In this blog, we explored different commands of Docker containers, images, emphasising their roles in container &amp; image creation. In the next blog, we will delve deeper into the technical aspects. Stay tuned

As I continue my RHCSA journey with the 30-day Linux challenge, today’s focus is all about mastering paths something that might seem small but it plays a huge role in working effectively within a Linux environment.
Understanding the difference between absolute and relative paths is essential for navigating the file system with confidence, writing scripts and managing tasks precisely. So let’s simplify this with examples, tips and real-world use.

                              <span>📊 Machine learning is about using data to make smart predictions or decisions. 
But other fields (like statistics or psychology) also work with data, so how they are different than Machine Learning ❓
And the correct answer is - ✅ their goals are different.
To understand it much more clearly let me give an example:
🌻 Imagine you have a garden.
You notice some flowers are growing really big, and some are small. Now you&#x27;re curious - why are some flowers bigger than others?
📈 In Statistics:
You count how much 🌊 water, ☀️ sunlight, and 🌱 fertilizer each flower got.
“Ah! When I give more water, flowers grow bigger!”
You make a rule (a model) to explain what makes the flowers grow.
&quot;why&quot; here is:
“Because they got more water and sunlight.”
So you create a model to explain the relationship — you’re interested in the why.
✅ Goal: Understand the cause behind the outcome.
🧠 In Psychology:
Let’s say you&#x27;re studying how your friend feels.
When your friend doesn&#x27;t sleep, they get cranky 😠.
You ask:
“Why is my friend cranky today?”
And you think:
“Maybe it’s because they didn’t sleep well 😴.”
So you&#x27;re trying to find the real reason behind feelings or behavior.
“Because they didn’t sleep.”
You try to find the real reason behind their feelings or behavior.
✅ Goal: Understand human emotions and behavior — again, the why.
🤖 In Machine Learning:
You give the computer LOTS of examples:
How much water each flower got 💧.


How big it grew 🌼



The computer learns to guess flower size just by looking at water and sunlight —  but it doesn’t really know why. 
It just learns to make good guesses.
“Why is this flower big?”
It might say:
“I don’t know, but I saw something like this before, and it turned out big.”
✅ Goal: Make accurate predictions, even if it doesn’t understand why.
So, the goal is the key difference in Machine learning vs Others (like statistics or psychology).
✨ Machine Learning is less about explaining why something happens and more about guessing what will happen next, based on patterns in data.</span>

                              <span>If you&#x27;ve spent any time developing AI, whether it&#x27;s a chatbot, a support agent, or a simple Q&amp;A app, you&#x27;ve already come across messages. Even if you didn’t pay them much attention, they were there, quietly doing the heavy lifting behind every interaction.
So, why should you care about messages in the first place?
They are the foundation of how chat models communicate. Messages carry the what, who, and how of a conversation. Without understanding them, you&#x27;re essentially flying blind. But once you do, you gain precise control over your model&#x27;s behavior, clarity in structuring your prompts, and flexibility when building more advanced workflows.

All comments were stored as a single, lengthy text.
There was no option to categorize the comments.
Oracle 23ai introduces the Annotation feature, which provides similar functionality to comments but with additional capabilities. Using Annotations, users can add structured and categorized descriptions to objects like tables, views, materialized views, indexes, and columns, based on name-value pairs.

At least one Annotation_name is mandatory for an annotation.

I don’t want to scare you, but someone on Twitter said that “most jobs will become obsolete” in less than 10 years. McKinsey agrees (they say AI Agents will replace 70% of office work), and Goldman, too.
So, I guess our clock is ticking. We don’t have much time. It’s probably better to take a woodworking course or something similar.

But I am not that good at woodworking. So, let’s try to understand how AI Agents work and if they are that scary.
If you read Twitter or Linkedin, AI Agents look like special agents that can do everything. The demos that they share look amazing.

However, these agents don’t feel that special when you use them. They are helpfu…</span>

I&#x27;m Dmitry, the creator of Sury—the fastest schema library out there. If you’re a fan of Zod (and who isn’t?), you’ll want to read this. Today, I want to share some surprising findings about Zod v4’s performance, what it means for you, and how to avoid the pitfalls.
Let’s start with a little clickbait:

Zod v4 became 17 times slower, and nobody noticed 🙈
This is 100% true, but of course, that’s not the whole story. Let’s dig in.
Recently, while prepping for the big Sury v10 release, I decided to rerun my benchmarks with Zod v4. The results? Fascinating.
For a non-trivial schema, Zod v4 is now 8x faster than before.
But when you create a schema and use it just once (a common pattern in React components), performance drops significantly—down to about 6 ops/ms.

Over the years, a few MB have accumulated and at some point I had to think about where to put them in order to keep the size of the blog under 1GB. Outsourcing to YouTube? I can, but that would be the wrong direction for me. Something on Fediverse or the social web? Of course ... Peertube!
On the German instance clip.place operated by adminForge, a channel for the videos was quickly created and uploaded. Basically I only had to change the URL&#x27;s in the video and iframe tags to the new ones.

                              <span>In November 2024, Anthropic published a blog post announcing what may be its most significant contribution to the AI ecosystem so far: the Model Context Protocol.
According to the official definition on the website:
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C offers a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
Quickly, other players began announcing support for this new protocol:

To keep this post concise, I won’t discuss the architecture defined by MCP in detail, but I’ll leave some links at the end for those who want to dive deeper.

                              <span>A few months ago, I started building my online gaming Blog and E-commerce site for the Roblox gaming community. But instead of going the easy route with shared hosting or a managed WordPress provider, I wanted full control.
So I spun up a bare Ubuntu VPS, installed NGINX, and started learning everything the hard (but rewarding) way.
Why WordPress on a VPS?
No bloat: I wanted a clean, fast stack — no unnecessary plugins or GUIs.
More control: From PHP version to rewrite rules, I wanted to tweak everything myself.
Cheaper in the long run: VPS plans are affordable and scale well.
Stack Setup (The Barebones Way)
I’m running:
Ubuntu 22.04
NGINX
PHP 8.2
MySQL
Let’s Encrypt SSL
WordPress (manual install via wget)
No cPanel, no one-click install — just terminal commands, logs, and Google when thin…</span>

                              <span>Bots are a fact of life on the internet. 
Some are helpful—like search engine crawlers. 
Others scrape your data, spam your forms, or brute-force your login pages. 
If you’re self-hosting with Nginx, you don’t need a pricey SaaS WAF to stop them. 
Here&#x27;s how to detect and destroy malicious bots using good ol’ Nginx, a few scripts, and some zip-bomb flavor.
Nginx logs tell the full story. Make sure you&#x27;re capturing User-Agent, IP, and paths.
log_format  main  &#x27;$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] &quot;$request&quot; &#x27;
                  &#x27;$status $body_bytes_sent &quot;$http_referer&quot; &#x27;
                  &#x27;&quot;$http_user_agent&quot;&#x27;;
access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;

Now dig through logs for patterns:
# Top IPs by request volume

                              <span>Most indie hackers make this mistake:
They build a product — then try to find customers.
I’m trying the opposite. I launched a landing page first, and immediately started testing demand with paid ads — even before writing a single line of code.
Building a product takes time.
And if nobody wants it... all that effort is wasted.
Instead of waiting until launch, I want answers early:
Are people searching for this kind of product?
Will they click?
Will they leave a lead?
How much will it cost me to get one?
What I did:
Built a simple landing page on Framer in one day
Set up a €20 test budget on Google Ads
Created a form to collect early leads
Tracked everything manually — no complex funnel yet
I made a mistake 😅
600 useless clicks later, I paused the campaign.
Second try: ✅
High-intent keywords
Simple ad copy
No display, no video, no smart automation
The result? Lower traffic — but real, relevant visitors. And a few leads.
Even with €10–20, I got signal:
People are searching for this
I’m getting a few signups
And I can start estimating my customer acquisition cost
This will help me decide:
Is this idea worth building?
What pricing makes sense?
What channels work best?
Next steps
(Hint: talk to them — don’t ghost them.)
Let me know if you&#x27;re testing your own SaaS ideas too — I&#x27;d love to hear your approach!</span>

That familiar sinking feeling hits: &quot;Why can&#x27;t I connect?&quot; If you&#x27;ve worked with AWS, you&#x27;ve likely been there. Network connectivity issues in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) are common, often frustrating, but almost always solvable with a systematic approach.

In the cloud, networking isn&#x27;t just plumbing; it&#x27;s the central nervous system of your applications. Your VPC configuration dictates how your resources communicate with each other, with other AWS services, and with the wider internet. A misconfigured route table, a forgotten security g…</span>

                              <span>Have you ever wondered how Netflix knows what to recommend? Or how your bank detects fraud? The answer lies in data science
In this article, I’ll explain what data science is, why it’s so important today, and share a beginner-friendly roadmap to help you get started.
What is data science?
At its core, it is the art of extracting knowledge from data. It combines:
Mathematics
Statistics
Programming
With data science, we can discover patterns, make predictions, and solve real-world problems using data.
Why is Data Science Important Today?
We live in a world where data is everywhere. But data alone is not enough. We need data science to understand it and use it effectively.
Beginner’s Roadmap to Learn Data Science
You don’t need to be a math expert to start! Here’s a practical path you can follow:</span>

I was using Framer Motion’s layout animations to animate a background highlight that follows the active tab. Each tab was a div, and I added onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave event listeners to track which tab was currently highlighted. Simple enough, right?
It worked... until I started moving my mouse quickly between the tabs.
Sometimes, especially when I moved the mouse at a high speed, none of the tabs appeared to be hovered. The highlight vanished. It was as if my mouse had exited all the elements, even though it was clearly moving over them.
That behavior didn’t make sense.
So I dug in. And that’s when I stumbled upon the differences betwe…</span>

  ⛓️ String formatting and interpolation


The first way that people often learn to join values and strings is the concatenating method:
words &#x3D; &quot;5&quot;
concat_str &#x3D; &quot;This string has &quot; + words + &quot; words&quot;

However, this method is not very readable and doesn&#x27;t work on many languages.
Interpolated strings are a way of combinating variables and fixed strings in a more visual way, which can help code insight and debugging.
The next three ways are much better and have some useful particularities:
f-strings (my favourite)
.format()
% operator

                              <span>1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row
Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Array, Greedy
In a row of dominoes, tops[i] and bottoms[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)
We may rotate the ith domino, so that tops[i] and bottoms[i] swap values.
Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in tops are the same, or all the values in bottoms are the same.
If it cannot be done, return -1.
Example 1:

Input: tops &#x3D; [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms &#x3D; [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: The first figure represents the dominoes as given by tops and bottoms: before we do any rotations.


If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated …</span>

curl (connect URL) is a command line tool and a library for transferring data with URLs.
curl?


Curl literay let&#x27;s do anything related urls. It can:
Test any REST/ GraphQL/ API
Test anything else related to http/https requests and responses.
Test xml/ json RPC protocols
Upload/ download files
Perform Monitoring and deployments with the help of scripts
If you&#x27;re an engineer of just a pc enthusiast who works with urls, you should learn curl coz it&#x27;s gonna make your life easier.
curl Flags:




-X : Specifies the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
-H &quot;
&quot;: Adds a header to the request.
-d &quot;&quot;: Sends data with a POST request (useful for sending JSON).
-I: Fetches only the HTTP headers.
-O: Saves the response to a file.

One of the MOST important rules in automation is having independent tests. This means tests should not rely on each other and you should be able to run any test from any suite at any time. 
In this blog post, I am sharing some proven practices I&#x27;ve picked up over a decade in test automation. Cypress is used for the demos, but the concepts apply to any test automation stack.
Special thanks to @Sebastian Clavijo Suero for his great feedback and suggestions! 
⚠️ Disclaimer: The techniques and practices shared in this article are based on real-world experience across multiple projects and teams. While they’ve worked well for me and many others, they’re not the only way to approach test isolation, and I’m not claiming these are the best approaches. There may be different valid soluti…</span>

                              <span>Listen. I adore Flutter. Like, I’m talking full-on, butterflies-in-my-stomach, swipe-right-every-time kind of love. It&#x27;s beautiful, modern, and powerful. It lets me build for Android and iOS (and more!) with one codebase, which is honestly chef’s kiss. Flutter has been the MVP of my career as a mobile dev. But even in the healthiest relationships, you have fights, right? And me and Flutter... we have some fights. Sometimes it gaslights me. Sometimes I wake up and wonder if I made the right choice.
So this isn’t a hate post. It’s not a breakup letter. It’s more of a... vent. A good ol’ &quot;I love you but what are you even doing right now???&quot; post.
Here are 10 things that make me mad about Flutter, even though I wouldn’t trade it for anything else (well… maybe for a decent debugging experience …</span>

Junie isn’t just another AI assistant that suggests code snippets. Launched in January 2025 and now production-ready, Junie represents a leap from reactive code suggestions to proactive task execution. Unlike traditional tools like GitHub Copilot, which focus on autocompletion, Junie acts as a collaborative agent capable of planning, executing, and debugging multi-step workflows — saving hours of manual effort! It’s an autonomous coding agent that can take on entire tasks, from understanding your project structure to writing code, running tests, and even refactoring, all within your IDE.

In this guide, we’ll go through:
Installing wxPython
Creating a simple window
Adding buttons and handling events
To get started, install wxPython:
pip install wxPython

Here&#x27;s a basic wxPython window:
import wx

app &#x3D; wx.App(False)
frame &#x3D; wx.Frame(None, wx.ID_ANY, &quot;Hello wxPython!&quot;, size&#x3D;(300, 200))
frame.Show(True)
app.MainLoop()

A basic window titled “Hello wxPython!” will appear.
Let&#x27;s add a button and show a message when it&#x27;s clicked:
import wx

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(None, title&#x3D;&quot;wxPython Button Example&quot;, size&#x3D;(300, 200))
        panel &#x3D; wx.Panel(self)

        self.button &#x3D; wx.Button(panel, label&#x3D;&quot;Click Me&quot;, pos&#x3D;(100, 50))
        self.button.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.on_click)

    def on_click(self, event):
        wx.MessageBox(&quot;You clicked the button!&quot;, &quot;Info&quot;, wx.OK | wx.ICON_INFORMATION)

app &#x3D; wx.App(False)
frame &#x3D; MyFrame()
frame.Show()
app.MainLoop()

wxPython is a powerful and flexible way to create cross-platform desktop apps using Python.

description: &quot;From floating-point quirks to BigInt, learn how numbers really work in JavaScript with examples and best practices.&quot;
JavaScript is a powerful and flexible language, but its handling of numbers can be a bit quirky—especially if you&#x27;re coming from languages like Python or Java. In this article, we’ll break down how numbers work in JavaScript — from basic arithmetic to edge cases you should know.
In JavaScript, all numbers are stored as floating-point values, even if they look like integers.
console.log(typeof 10);       // &quot;number&quot;
console.log(typeof 10.5);     // &quot;number&quot;

JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format.
let a &#x3D; 5;
let b &#x3D; 2;

console.log(a + b); // 7
console.log(a - b); // 3

                              <span>Hugo is a fantastic piece of software, IMHO.
It&#x27;s highly flexible and covers lots of great features, which saves hours of work.
If you want to dive into theme development, this could be a great contribution for the community.
However, it&#x27;s easy to miss critical concepts if you don&#x27;t spend enough time learning how to do it right.
Hugo is a framework, so it has its specificity.
It&#x27;s impossible to cover everything here, but, roughly speaking, many templates will inherit from generic structures, so you can prevent unnecessary duplication (e.g., HTML markup) just by defining blocks and using hooks:

Have you ever looked at a project&#x27;s commit history and struggled to understand what changes were made and why? Or spent hours trying to find a specific feature addition or bug fix among hundreds of vague commit messages? You&#x27;re not alone. The way we document our code changes can make the difference between a maintainable, collaborative project and a confusing mess of undocumented changes.
In this post, we&#x27;ll explore the power of good commit messages through conventional commits and introduce you to GitHub Commit Labels - a nifty tool that transforms your commit history into an easy-to-navigate, visually informative timeline that both humans and tools can understand.

However, many relevant posts go unanswered or receive inconsistent feedback. To address this gap, LimeLight was developed—an intelligent assistant designed to autonomously detect relevant discussions, retrieve contextual data, and generate high-quality, sentiment-aware responses in Niche communities like Reddit and Slack.
This project demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), modern language models, and sentiment analysis can be combined to enrich community interactions in a scalable and meaningful way.

Every AWS developer has been there: you need to download an entire S3 folder structure containing thousands of files, and suddenly you&#x27;re faced with a frustrating reality—AWS doesn&#x27;t provide a simple way to do this at scale.
You could:
👆 Click through the AWS Console manually (impossible for large folders)
🖥️ Learn and configure the AWS CLI (with its own quirks and limitations)
🔨 Build a custom solution (which inevitably becomes a project in itself)
This challenge becomes particularly acute when dealing with data archives containing tens of thousands of files or datasets measuring in the tens or hundreds of gigabytes. Many organizations resort to inefficient workarounds or accept the operational bottleneck.

The product had Lambda functions. It had API Gateway. It had Cognito. It had S3, CloudFront, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, IAM policies, and more. The architecture diagram looked like a subway map. And yet... nobody used it.
The truth is simple: you don&#x27;t need AWS to build something users love.
There is a common trap that builders fall into. You read a few blog posts or see a diagram on Twitter and suddenly you think your tiny project needs the same architecture as Netflix.
You don’t.
Most early-stage projects die not because they lacked scalability, but because they lacked users. Or because the product was confusing, buggy, or didn’t solve a real problem.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a concept so deeply ingrained in everyday programming practices that ignoring it could almost be considered a cardinal sin, on par with neglecting version control. But why has DI become so crucial?
DI is one of the key principles enabling the creation of flexible and maintainable applications. The philosophy behind it revolves around freeing code from unnecessary details that tightly couple logical components. Components no longer depend on specific implementations of other parts of the system—they simply declare their needs, and DI provides the required dependencies.
The goal here is not just to master a trendy technology but to explore a universal architectural tool whose concepts transcend different ecosystems. Studying DI across multiple lang…</span>

Google Online Assessment (OA) for the Summer Internship 2025 is a crucial part of the hiring process. This assessment tests your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and your aptitude for tackling complex algorithms. One of the typical problems you might encounter is transforming a number into a palindromic binary form with the least number of operations. In this blog, we will delve into this problem and provide strategies to solve it efficiently.

You are given a number ( N ) (0 &lt;&#x3D; ( N ) &lt;&#x3D; 2 * 10^9), and you can perform the following operation any number of times, including zero:
Increase or decrease the number by 1.
Your task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the binary form of ( N ) palindromic.

If you&#x27;ve ever needed to save output to a file but still see it on the screen while running a command, &quot;tee&quot; is the perfect solution. Let’s break down what it does, why it matters, and how you can use it like a pro.  
1. What Is the &quot;tee&quot; Command?
2. Why Is &quot;tee&quot; Important?
Basic Usage: Viewing and Saving Output Simultaneously
Appending Data Instead of Overwriting
Using &quot;tee&quot; with Multiple Commands
Use Case 1: Logging System Commands in Real Time
Use Case 2: Saving Error Messages While Running a Script
Use Case 3: Viewing Updates While Writing to a Log File

Welcome back to Day 11 of our Linux journey! Over here, we are learning by doing every single day.
Many Red Hat systems run in places where there&#x27;s no internet access. Whether you are on a server in a secure data center or working in a lab, you may find yourself needing to install packages like Apache, Vim, or Python, but without online repositories mainly because of security.
In this article, you will learn how to turn a RHEL 9 ISO file into a full offline repository using dnf. You can also use yum.

                              <span>The Problem


Too often, data engineering tasks that should be simple end up requiring heavyweight tools. Something breaks, or I need to explore a new dataset, and suddenly I’m firing up Spark or connecting to a cloud warehouse - even though the data easily fits on my laptop. That adds extra steps, slows things down, and costs more than it should. I wanted something simpler for local analytics that could still handle serious queries.
DuckDB is an open-source, in-process SQL OLAP database designed for analytics.
It runs embedded inside applications, similar to SQLite, but optimized for analytical queries like joins, aggregations, and large scans.
In short, it goes fast without adding the complexity of distributed systems.

                              <span>When building containerized applications with Docker, one common frustration developers face is the lack of live updates when editing code. For example, you tweak server.js or a front-end file, but the changes don’t reflect in the running app. Why?
Because Docker copies your project files into the container when you build the image. Once the container starts, it runs on that static snapshot—isolated from your host file system.
Restarting the container every time you make a change? That’s inefficient.
Enter: Bind Mounts.
Bind mounts allow you to map a file or directory on your host machine to a path inside your running container.
This means:
Your container reads real-time code from your host.
You can make live changes on your local system, and see them reflected instantly inside your contai…</span>

                              <span>I’ve always been fascinated by technology—whether it&#x27;s the cutting-edge advancements in AI, quantum computing, or the next big thing in automation. But recently, I stumbled upon something that completely blew my mind. Imagine a computer, not powered by silicon chips or mechanical components, but by human brain cells. Yes, you read that right—human brain cells.
At first, I thought it was some kind of sci-fi fantasy or a wild concept for a dystopian movie, but as I dug deeper, I realized this was something very real. And let me tell you, it was one of those moments that made me stop in my tracks, reevaluate everything I thought I knew about computing, and leave me in awe of the future that’s unfolding right before our eyes.

                              <span>In Python, working with dictionaries often involves checking whether a key exists before performing operations. This can add unnecessary lines of code and reduce readability. The defaultdict from Python&#x27;s collections module simplifies this process elegantly.
defaultdict?


A defaultdict automatically initializes keys with a default value if they don&#x27;t exist. This means you can start using the dictionary right away without having to check for the existence of keys manually.

MatrixSwarm is a decentralized, file-based operating system for autonomous agents. This week we achieved:
✅ Simultaneous universe deployment

✅ Command-line directive control

✅ True UNIVERSE_ID-scoped singleton enforcement

✅ Runtime heatmaps, delegation, full job tree expansion  
The entire swarm is controlled by Python scripts:
site_boot.py — deploy any swarm
site_kill.py — wipe a swarm
site_list.py — scan swarm status (🔥 or ❄️)
Full CLI toolkit. No container overhead. No sockets. No noise.
Swarm OS is now real.
We’re shipping the full site_ops_bundle_v1.zip and pushing to Git this week.

Follow these steps carefully to resolve the GPG key issue and ensure a clean Docker installation. Run each command exactly as shown to avoid syntax errors.
To avoid conflicts or malformed entries, let’s clean up any existing Docker repository files:
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

Ensure your system has the necessary tools:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

The -y flag automatically confirms the installation.
This step ensures curl and gnupg are available for fetching and processing the GPG key.
Set up the keyring directory and fetch Docker’s GPG key:
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo chmod 755 /etc/apt/keyrings

Tracking users is a touchy topic. Should you rely on screen size? Favicon loading hacks (like this one)? Or something more exotic?
Honestly, it depends. What level of accuracy do you need? How much time are you willing to sink into it? There&#x27;s a sea of FOSS libraries and SaaS platforms out there, but sometimes you don’t want the whole enterprise-grade circus—just a quick way to know if &quot;User A&quot; today is the same &quot;User A&quot; from last week. Ideally, it should also be low-maintenance and not break every time a browser sneezes.

O Adapter é um padrão de projeto estrutural que tem como objetivo &quot;traduzir&quot; ou adaptar o funcionamento de um código X para que seja compatível com o código Y.
Imagine que você tem várias classes de pagamento que implementam uma interface comum chamada Pagamento — por exemplo: Pix, Ted e Boleto.
Agora, sua equipe precisa integrar uma nova forma de pagamento, como PayPal, desenvolvida por outra squad ou vinda de uma biblioteca de terceiros. Essa classe PayPal não implementa a interface Pagamento, e isso quebraria o padrão da sua aplicação.
Para resolver esse problema sem modificar a biblioteca externa (o que muitas vezes nem é possível), usamos o padrão Adapter, que atua como um &quot;tradutor&quot; entre as interfaces. Ele faz com que a classe PayPal seja compatível com a interface Pagame…</span>

Here’s why every child should learn the basics of coding and AI—not just to build apps, but to stay safe, think critically, and thrive in the future.
From YouTube recommendations to ChatGPT, AI influences what kids see, hear, and interact with daily. Without basic knowledge, they may:
Fall for deepfake scams (fake videos, voice clones).
Trust biased AI decisions (e.g., unfair algorithms in hiring or loans).
Share data unknowingly (AI-powered apps collect personal info).

since i promised y&#x27;all that in this EP i will talk about the topic: Verifiable ML Property Cards? Lamination Time.
so, I’m here to unpack it the way my brain understood it!! no fluff, just the real deal.🔥 (cook level:100%)
let&#x27;s see what i have learned from this topic🔥🔥👇🏻
We’ve all seen those model cards and datasheets floating around AI projects, right? Basically, they’re like “nutrition labels” for machine learning models which tell you what data was used, what the model can do, and sometimes how it was trained.
BUT HERE’S THE CATCH: They’re all based on trust. You hope the person publishing that card isn’t lying.
And in a world where AI regulations are about to go wild (Europe, U.S., everyone catching up), “hoping” isn’t good enough anymore!!

Microservices have earned a reputation as a modern and agile approach to building software systems, particularly for organizations dealing with rapid change, distributed teams, and complex business domains. Yet, like any architectural decision, microservices carry a dual nature—bringing both significant advantages and notable trade-offs.
This article explores the true motivations behind adopting microservices, outlines what makes them powerful yet costly, and discusses when they’re the right choice for your software landscape.

Let’s get real for a second:

You’ve probably been pouring your heart into creating videos, ads, and reels, only to watch them flop—no views, no likes, no comments. And that’s frustrating, right?
But here’s the thing:

It’s not your fault.

In today’s world, attention spans are shorter than ever. People scroll through endless content, and if your video doesn’t grab them in the first few seconds, it’s gone, just like that.
So, how do you create videos that actually grab attention and get results?

You’ve updated your systems. Applied patches. Everything seems fine.
But no system can be truly secure or efficient without ongoing monitoring.
No logs &#x3D; No alerts &#x3D; delayed response to attacks or resource exhaustion

No visibility means attackers could go unnoticed (e.g., unauthorized SSH access)

Unpatched systems or performance spikes might indicate compromise but without monitoring, you&#x27;d never know.
Cybercriminals thrive in the dark. Monitoring shines a light.
In a production environment, a slow server is more dangerous than a down server.

                              <span>When working with Laravel Eloquent models, you often need to modify or compute attribute values before using them in your application. This is where accessors come into play—they allow you to manipulate data seamlessly when retrieving it from the database.
In this article, we’ll explore:
What accessors are and why they’re useful
How to define and use them
Practical examples (including checking for subtasks)

What Are Accessors in Laravel?


An accessor is a method in an Eloquent model that lets you modify an attribute’s value when accessing it. Instead of manually formatting or computing values every time, you define the logic once in the model, and Laravel automatically applies it.
Why Use Accessors?

                              <span>CRON expressions are powerful tools for scheduling tasks — from backups to emails — across servers, cloud platforms, and CI/CD pipelines. While they may look cryptic at first, once you decode the pattern, you unlock a whole new level of automation.
A CRON expression is a string with 5 space-separated fields (sometimes 6 or 7 depending on the system) that define a recurring schedule.
┌──────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌──── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
│ │ │ │ ┌─ day of week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)

                              <span>🔗 Understanding the TCP 3-Way Handshake:


The TCP 3-Way Handshake is a fundamental process that establishes a reliable connection between two devices over a TCP/IP network. It involves three steps: SYN (Synchronize), SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge), and ACK (Acknowledge). During the handshake, the client and server exchange initial sequence numbers and confirm the connection establishment.  
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a foundational internet protocol designed to:
reliably (no lost or duplicated packets)

✅ Ensure in-order delivery (packets arrive in the order they were sent)

✅ Provide error-checking (detect and fix corrupted data)
Unlike UDP (which just throws data out, hoping it arrives), TCP carefully sets up, manages, and closes connections.

                              <span>How writing pure functions and avoiding shared state can lead to cleaner, more powerful code


In today’s world of software development, clarity and maintainability are more valuable than ever. Functional programming (FP) — once considered an academic curiosity — is now a widely used paradigm in real-world applications. But what exactly is functional programming, and why should you care?
Let’s break it down.
Functional programming is a way of thinking about software construction that treats computation as the evaluation of pure functions and avoids changing state or using mutable data.
Rather than telling the computer how to do something (like in imperative programming), you describe what you want done. This leads to predictable, testable, and often more compact code.
A pure function:

But why? Because building a resume depends on multiple factors, like who you are, what job you are applying for, and what the company is looking for.
You can&#x27;t simply create a resume and then send it to 100+ companies on LinkedIn.
And when you finally sit down to specifically write one, you get tons of questions like:
Should I use a template or build from scratch?
How do I format it?
Do I need to add all my achievements and create a one- or two-page resume?
Will this even pass through the ATS?
This is where AI resume builders are helpful, as they are trained on numerous professional resumes to help you create one according to your requirements.

What is a color-shifting hover card?
A color-shifting hover card is a type of hover effect that changes the background color of a card or element when the user hovers over it. It is a fun and interactive way to add some visual interest to your website or app. The effect is achieved by using CSS gradients and JavaScript to update the card&#x27;s background color based on the user&#x27;s cursor position. You can obviously use solid colors instead of gradients, but gradients are more versatile and can be used for more complex effects…</span>

                              <span>We’re used to seeing technology upgrade our phones, cars, and even refrigerators—but what about rugs? Surprisingly, the square rug is getting a smart upgrade, and it might be one of the most interesting entries into the world of smart textiles and IoT.
Smart home devices are becoming more ambient—more invisible—and rugs are uniquely positioned for that. With the right materials and sensor tech, a square rug can function as a pressure-sensitive interface, tracking things like:
Presence detection
Gait patterns
Fall detection
Room activity heatmaps
All of this is possible thanks to pressure sensors, conductive threads, and microcontroller integration. Think of it like embedding a low-profile layer of computer vision—except without the privacy concerns of cameras.

                              <span>Привет, разработчики! 👋
Вы когда-нибудь хотели мгновенно реагировать на получение доната через DonationAlerts? Может быть, запустить эффект на стриме, обновить дашборд или просто надежно логировать донаты без постоянных запросов к API? Опрос API (polling) работает, но он неэффективен и не обеспечивает реального времени.
DonationAlerts предлагает способ получать эти уведомления мгновенно с помощью WebSockets, но настройка включает в себя прохождение потока OAuth 2.0 и работу с их специфичным протоколом WebSocket (на базе Centrifugo).
В этом руководстве мы пройдемся по шагам:
 Регистрация приложения в DonationAlerts.
 Реализация потока авторизации OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code с использованием Python (на FastAPI).
 Подключение к WebSocket DonationAlerts (Centrifugo).

                              <span>💰 Cost Optimization with AWS Compute Optimizer.
“You can’t optimize what you don’t measure.” — This quote holds especially true in the cloud.
In this blog, I’ll walk you through what Compute Optimizer is, how it works, and how I used it in a real-world project to save money without compromising performance.
🔍 What is AWS Compute Optimizer?
EC2 instances
⚙️ How Compute Optimizer Works
Go to the AWS Console.
🧪 Real-World Use Case: Cost Cutting with EC2
We had 6 EC2 instances of type t3.large in a production environment. These handled various microservices with relatively low average usage but had burst workloads occasionally.
Compute Optimizer Analysis:
CPU utilization: &lt;10% average
Switch to t3.medium
We used this migration strategy:
Create AMI backups
No increase in latency
🛑 Things to Keep in Mind
Is this instance intentionally over-provisioned? (e.g., for redundancy or DR)
📦 What About EBS and Lambda?
We had a general-purpose gp2 volume attached to our dev environment with almost no IO requirements.
Compute Optimizer suggested sc1 (cold HDD), and we tested it for archive-type workloads.
✅ Result: No functional issues, 60% storage cost saved.
Lambda
In a different project, our Lambda functions had 1024MB memory allocated by default. Compute Optimizer showed average usage around 200MB.
We lowered to 512MB, which also reduced the timeout rate and improved cold-start behavior.
📊 How to Track the Savings
Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor actual savings
AWS Trusted Advisor → checks for idle load balancers, unused IPs, etc.
🔚 Final Thoughts
🎯 It&#x27;s free, data-backed, and supports multiple AWS services.
In my experience, implementing even 10–15% of the recommendations led to significant savings — without a single service interruption.</span>

Text-to-speech has come a long way from the robotic voices of the past. Today&#x27;s TTS technology can produce remarkably natural-sounding speech that&#x27;s nearly indistinguishable from human voices. But for many users, access to high-quality voice synthesis has meant wrestling with complex interfaces or limited options.
What if you could have studio-quality voice synthesis right in your terminal? What if converting text to speech was as simple as typing a single command? That&#x27;s exactly what Kokoro TTS delivers.
In this post, we&#x27;ll explore the world of natural text-to-speech, why command-line tools make sense for voice synthesis, and introduce you to Kokoro TTS, a powerful CLI tool that brings professional-grade voice s…</span>

                              <span>Over the course of several years, I embarked on an ambitious solo journey to create a digital education business. What began as a simple idea evolved through multiple iterations—each one teaching me something about technology, process, and the nature of entrepreneurship itself. This is the story of that journey—from Katacoding to Sigmacasts to Octal Stream—and the insights I gained along the way.
The concept began with Katacoding, a platform offering live, one-on-one online coding lessons via video calls. While the model had promise, it lacked scalability. That realization led to Sigmacasts, a curated series of educational videos on math and computer science. The production process taught me how to craft educational narratives and use video to communicate abstract ideas.

Let’s dive into the difference between them, their usage with examples, and best practices.
Let’s say you have an interface MessageService and two implementations: EmailService and SMSService.
public interface MessageService {
    void sendMessage(String message);
}

@Component
public class EmailService implements MessageService {
    public void sendMessage(String message) {

                              <span>Rendering HTML from data is a common task in frontend applications. In a single page application this is usually handled by libraries like React.
There will be instances where we need to render a piece of data into a HTML string, in plain Javascript, without using frontend libraries like React. The rendered template string can then be inserted into a DOM element.
Here is a way to organize data and templates using this approach.
Fetch or gather the template data.
Pass the data to render function.
render function determines which template to render and renders the data.
Lightweight
Organized
Seperation of data and template
Structure similar to React components
Here is an example of the data in the implementation.

But here’s the good news: you can often fix the most common causes in minutes.
In this article, we’ll explain why your API is slow, how to quickly diagnose the root cause, and the simple changes you can make today to speed things up, without rewriting your whole backend.
A slow API isn’t just a technical problem—it’s a business killer.
Users abandon apps with poor performance.


Front-end teams waste time implementing ugly workarounds.


Your infrastructure costs go up due to bloated compute time.



So let’s fix it—fast.
Before you can fix, you have to measure. Here&#x27;s how to get clarity, fast:

In Part 1 of this series, I shared how and why we embraced Test-Driven Development (TDD) at Bynry Inc. to improve the quality and reliability of our Smart360 utility management platform. Now, let&#x27;s dive into the technical details of our implementation—how we designed our testing framework, the architectural choices we made, and the real-world results we&#x27;ve achieved.
When Gaurav and I set out to build our testing framework, we had several key requirements:
Support for API testing: Since Smart360 is built on microservices, we needed robust API testing capabilities
Easy to write tests: Developers should find the framework intuitive and straightforward 
Comprehensive coverage: The framework should help identify untested code paths
Clear feedback: When tests fail, develo…</span>

                              <span>React has no shortage of state management libraries. From the heavyweight champion Redux to modern solutions like Zustand and Valtio, you’ve got options — sometimes too many. But what if you want something super tiny, fully type-safe, and feels like magic to use?
Meet @odemian/react-store: a global state manager that weighs less than 1KB (v0.0.5 is 400b gziped), has zero dependencies, and gives you reactive state via JavaScript proxies ✨.

Under the hood, it uses:
useSyncExternalStore for React 18+ compatibility
JavaScript Proxies for mutation tracking
A minimal internal pub/sub system
This gives you the mutability of Valtio, but with a more focused, compact footprint.

                              <span>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made incredible strides in understanding and generating human language. From chatbots to virtual assistants, AI-powered tools can mimic human conversation, provide customer support, and even write articles. However, despite these advancements, AI will never fully capture human communication. Why? Because human language is deeply rooted in emotions, cultural contexts, creativity, and nuances that AI struggles to grasp.
This Blog explores the key differences between AI-generated language and human communication, highlighting why AI will always fall short of replicating human interaction entirely.
The Complexity of Human Language
Understand sarcasm and irony.
AI Lacks Emotional Intelligence:  AI vs. Human Emotions
Empathy in conversations.
Creativity and Storytelling: A Human-Only Domain
AI cannot create original ideas.
The Power of Personal Experiences Human Storytelling vs. AI
The Role of Cultural and Social Influences
Keep up with new trends in language.
The Importance of Human Connection AI vs. Human Communication
Body language and facial expressions.
Unintended discrimination in responses.
Lack of inclusivity in AI-generated content.
Conclusion:
AI has revolutionized language processing, but it cannot replace human communication. Our ability to connect emotionally, create original stories, and adapt language based on context makes human interaction irreplaceable. While AI can enhance communication, it will always need human guidance to ensure meaningful, ethical, and culturally aware interactions.</span>

I’ve just wrapped up Week 1 of my DevOps journey, and let me tell you — it was an exciting, sometimes confusing, but deeply satisfying start. If you&#x27;re also starting out with DevOps or curious about how to begin, I hope my experience helps you learn (or avoid) a few things.
Here’s what I covered this week, what tripped me up, how I solved it, and a few useful insights for fellow beginners 👇
☁️ What I Learned This Week
What is Cloud Computing?
I finally got a grip on the difference between:
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Where you rent virtual hardware (like AWS EC2).
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Managed app platforms (like Heroku).
SaaS (Software as a Service): Apps delivered over the internet (like Google Docs).

Operational Technology (OT) underpins the world’s critical infrastructure, think power plants humming with electricity, water treatment facilities ensuring clean supply, or manufacturing lines churning out goods. These systems, driven by Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) setups, and IoT devices, are no longer isolated from the digital threats once reserved for IT networks. 
The convergence of IT and OT has opened new efficiencies but also new vulnerabilities. High-profile incidents, like the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, which disrupted fuel supply across the U.S. Southeast, spotlight the stakes: unpatched vulnerabilities in OT can cascade into real-world chaos.

Introduction: Your Dockerfile is a ticking time bomb unless you secure it
Dockerfiles are like spells simple to write, powerful in execution, and incredibly easy to screw up. You write 10 lines, ship it to production, and boom, you’re running a containerized service in the cloud. Feels magical, right? Well, that magic comes with a curse: insecurity by default.
Here’s the thing Docker doesn’t stop you from doing dumb stuff. It happily lets you:
Run everything as root
Add shady scripts from the internet
Bake secrets into the image
And pull a 2GB Ubuntu base image just to run curl.
If you’re guilty of any of these, don’t worry we’ve all been there. But it’s 2025, and the internet is way le…</span>

Introduction: when your IDE gets smarter than your senior dev
Imagine spinning up an entire dev team from scratch, but instead of scrambling to hire a front-end wizard, a DevOps guru, a tech writer who doesn’t hate Markdown, and a PM with magical sprint powers you just… open tabs.
Welcome to 2025, where AI tools are no longer cute toys that autocomplete console.log(&quot;hello world&quot;). They’re building dashboards, writing test cases, documenting APIs, managing projects, and in some cases, submitting PRs on your behalf like that overachieving intern no one trained.

Picture this: you’re cruising along on a smooth PostgreSQL powered ride, then suddenly BOOM your app scales to millions of users, and your database just can’t keep up. That’s not a plot twist from a DevOps horror story it’s what happened at Uber.
Back in its early days, Uber embraced PostgreSQL, one of the most loved open-source relational databases. But as the platform grew from a scrappy startup to a global ride-hailing juggernaut, PostgreSQL started showing cracks under pressure index bloat, replication issues, and painful upgrade paths. The engineers were spending more time babysitting the database than buildin…</span>

When we talk about security in the context of an application, we immediately think of three aspects:
Vulnerabilities (XSS…)
Authentication
Roles/permissions
In this article, we will explore different ways to manage user access and actions within a hypothetical platform designed to offer client/prospect management as well as quote/invoice tracking.
Our application allows SMEs to record billing information of their prospects or clients to easily reuse it for future quotes and invoices.
Considering that in an SME there may be several users needing access to the platform, we want these users to have different permissions. We can identify the following access levels:
Full admin: for the company owner
Semi-restricted access: for HRs

Introduction: kubernetes’ package manager dilemma
If you’ve deployed anything non-trivial on Kubernetes, you’ve probably been blessed (read: cursed) by Helm. For years, Helm has been the default package manager for Kubernetes apps. Charts, releases, values.yaml, and enough curly braces to give you PTSD. It’s the duct tape that somehow holds your YAML together.
But like every DevOps tool we worship and then meme to death, Helm has started showing its age. What once felt like a brilliant abstraction now sometimes feels like writing YAML that generates YAML to apply more YAML. It’s powerful sure but can also feel like overengineering disguised as a templating solution.
And right when we thought we were stuck in helm upgrade …</span>

Google và các công cụ tìm kiếm hiện đại đã chuyển trọng tâm sang trải nghiệm người dùng, nội dung thực sự hữu ích và độ tin cậy của người viết. Trong bài viết này, tôi chia sẻ cách tôi xây dựng chiến lược SEO bền vững, có hệ thống và phù hợp với các tiêu chuẩn mới nhất của Google – không “hack”, không “thủ thuật”.
Trước đây, SEO gắn liền với nhồi nhét từ khóa, tạo backlink hàng loạt, và chỉnh sửa thẻ meta. Những kỹ thuật đó có thể giúp bạn lên top – nhưng không giúp giữ chân người dùng. Từ 2023 trở đi, với các bản cập nhật như Helpful Content, SpamBrain, và Core Web Vitals, Google đị…</span>

Back in August 2020, Epic Games added its own way to pay inside Fortnite, skipping Apple’s built-in payment system. This broke Apple’s App Store rules, so Apple removed Fortnite from the store. In response, Epic sued Apple, saying the company had too much monopoly and was stopping fair competition.
The courtroom drama went over several years:
September 2021: A judge ruled that Apple was mostly right, but one of its rules—stopping developers from telling users about other payment options—was unfair under California law. Apple had to let developers share links to other ways to pay.

                              <span>In today’s fast-moving digital landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are no longer just tools—they’re decision-makers, collaborators, and even strategists. But as these systems grow more autonomous and complex, a pressing question arises: Do we truly understand how AI thinks, learns, and evolves?
The evolving behavior of AI agents isn’t just a technical curiosity—it’s a critical business risk that leaders must monitor closely. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the inner workings of AI agents, explore how their behavior can shift over time, and what that means for businesses across industries.
What Are AI Agents, Really?
Unlike traditional software, AI agents learn and adapt. This ability, while powerful, can lead to unpredictable behaviors, especially as agents interact with new data or collaborate with other agents in a shared system.
The Evolution of AI Behavior: A Double-Edged Sword
Examples of Evolving AI Behavior:
Bias amplification: Over time, AI models may reinforce and amplify hidden biases in training data.
Unexpected strategy development: AI agents in competitive environments (e.g., simulations, financial markets) may develop unanticipated strategies that break norms or ethical boundaries.
These evolving behaviors can introduce operational, ethical, and reputational risks if not properly understood and controlled.
Why Business Leaders Should Care
Autonomy Can Create Blind Spots


Unpredictability Increases Risk Exposure


Regulations Are Coming



Strategies to Manage AI Behavioral Risk
✅ AI Explainability
✅ Continuous Monitoring
✅ Ethical AI Governance
✅ Simulation &amp; Testing
The Future: Human-AI Collaboration with Guardrails
The question is no longer “What can AI do?” but “What is my AI actually doing—and why?”
Conclusion
🔍 Stay informed, stay prepared. The more we understand AI behavior, the safer—and smarter—our future becomes.</span>

What is Brim?
Brim is an open-source desktop application that processes pcap files and logs files, with a primary focus on providing search and analytics. It uses the Zeek log processing format. It also supports Zeek signatures and Suricata Rules for detection.
It can handle two types of data as an input;
Packet Capture Files: Pcap files created with tcpdump, tshark and Wireshark like applications.
Log Files: Structured log files like Zeek logs.
Brim is built on open-source platforms:
Zeek: Log generating engine.
Zed Language: Log querying language that allows performing keywoırd searches with filters and pipelines.
ZNG Data Format: Data storage format that supports saving data streams.
Electron and React: Cross-platform UI.

                              <span>When building a large-scale Java and Angular application on AWS, we must consider security at every layer from the underlying AWS infrastructure to the application code.
Here are some best practices - 
1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) with Least Privilege
Best Practice: Adopt a strict least privilege approach with our IAM policies. Assign users, roles, and services only the permissions they require, and enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
Examples:
Do not use root credentials for everyday tasks. Instead, create IAM roles for our services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) and assign specific policies.
Policy Example:
json
Real-Time Scenario: In a large-scale environment, our Java backend might run on an EC2 fleet or containers in ECS/EKS. By assigning each instance a dedicated IAM role with …</span>

                              <span>Both Mocky.io and Mock-API.net let you spin up mock APIs in seconds—but they serve very different needs. Mocky.io is the zero-friction, anonymous tool for one-off testing, while Mock-API.net is built for growing teams who need persistence, metrics, and (soon) collaboration.
No signup, no projects. Create a mock endpoint instantly via a simple form—no account required. Lose the URL and you lose the mock.
Static responses only. JSON/XML bodies, custom status codes, headers—no scripting or dynamic logic.
No analytics. Perfect for quick tests, demos, or throw-away responses, but not for long-term workflows.
Account &amp; Dashboard. Sign up to manage all your mocks in one place, with persistent URLs you can revisit anytime.
Project scaffolding. Organize mocks into named projects (coming soon) so nothing gets lost.
API-call metrics. Track raw call counts and response times today; add alerting and rate-limits in future releases.
Collaboration on the horizon. Team-invite and shared-project features are under development—get early access and shape the roadmap.

An alert triggered: &quot;Anomalous DNS Activity&quot;.
The case was assigned to you. Inspect the PCAP and retrieve the artefacts to confirm this alert is a true positive.
Investigate the dns-tunneling.pcap file. Investigate the dns.log file. What is the number of DNS records linked to the IPv6 address?  
After running zeek -Cr dns-tunneling.pcap, we run head -n 20 dns.log to investigate the file.
We see AAAA is marked for some records. As we know, AAAA stands for IPv6.

With this in mind, we run cat dns.log | grep AAAA | wc -l to get the number of DNS records linked to IPv6 addresses.

Investigate the conn.log file. What is the longest connection duration?
Upon reading the file conn.log, we got to see the parameter duration that represent the connection duration. We can try and z…</span>

nil in the Go Language


In the practice of Go language programming, the use of nil is extremely common. For example, the default type is assigned as nil, the error return value often uses return nil, and multiple types use if !&#x3D; nil for judgment, etc. However, regarding the knowledge point of nil, developers need to have an in-depth understanding of its essence and related characteristics. This article will comprehensively analyze nil around the following core questions:
Is nil a keyword, a type, or a variable?
Which types can use the !&#x3D; nil syntax?
What are the similarities and differences in the interaction between different types and nil?
Why do some composite structures need make(Type) to be used after defining variables?
Why can a slice be…</span>

You&#x27;re not alone — but there&#x27;s a smarter, cleaner, and way more scalable way to build UI components in Angular.
The secret? Mastering Angular Directives.
If you&#x27;re aiming to build a high-performance, maintainable UI that can scale without becoming a nightmare, it&#x27;s time to take Angular directives seriously. 
Let’s dive into how you can use them to supercharge your development process and create reusable UI elements like a pro.

Directives are Angular&#x27;s secret sauce for extending HTML functionality. You can use them to:
Manipulate the DOM
Apply custom behavior to elements/components
Create shared functionality across the app
There are three main types of directives:

In modern microservice or distributed system architecture, it&#x27;s crucial to know how to consume REST APIs effectively. In this guide, we’ll explore three powerful ways to consume APIs in Spring Boot:
🔗 RestTemplate – classic and synchronous.
⚡ WebClient – reactive and non-blocking.
🤝 FeignClient – declarative and elegant.
We’ll build a common User model and implement full CRUD operations with all HTTP headers (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type, Accept).
public class User {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Constructors, Getters, Setters
}

✅ Use when you&#x27;re building traditional apps with blocking I/O.

This post explores the transformative potential of blockchain technology in emerging markets by examining its funding challenges and opportunities. We delve into the history and ecosystem context of blockchain, detail core concepts, and illustrate practical applications such as financial inclusion, secure identity management, and supply chain transparency. We also analyze funding hurdles, strategic solutions, and the evolving landscape that combines decentralization with open-source projects. Along the way, we incorporate illustrations through tables and bullet lists, and link to authoritative sources such as Fueling the Future: Funding Blockchain Projects in Emerging Markets, Forbes on Agriculture Blockchain Innovations, and others.

I published my first library to Maven Central!
Although it’s public, I originally created it for my personal use — but if you find it helpful, I’d really appreciate it if you gave the repository a ⭐ and tried it out.
Thanks so much for reading!</span>

                              <span>Since the release of React 16.8 in 2019, building a reusable piece of UI (components) has become super easy. Thanks to the introduction of React Hooks. Now we don&#x27;t write verbose class-based components anymore. Over the years, the React team has introduced a ton of built-in hooks that solve specific problems.
But most of the people only stick with just useState() and useEffect(). But there are a lot of hooks that can improve your understanding and ability to write efficient code. As an experienced developer of React, I have tried to explain each of the advanced &amp; newly introduced hooks with proper real-world code examples. Let&#x27;s build the best app together.
Whenever you submit a form in React, you constantly juggle from to write the load of useStates and useEffects with fetch.

                              <span>The difference between @RestController and @Controller in Spring Framework lies mainly in how they handle HTTP responses.
@Controller




Used for: Traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) web applications.
Returns: Usually returns a View (like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
ResponseBody: If you want to return JSON/XML instead of a view, you must use @ResponseBody on the method.
Example:
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping(&quot;/hello&quot;)
    public String hello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
        return &quot;hello&quot;;  // returns a view named &quot;hello&quot;
    }

    @GetMapping(&quot;/api&quot;)
    @ResponseBody
    public String api() {
        return &quot;This is JSON or plain text&quot;;
    }
}

@RestController




Used for: RESTful web services (APIs).
Returns: Automatically returns JSON or XML responses.
Behavior: It is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody. So every method returns the body directly, not a view.
Example:
@RestController
public class MyRestController {

    @GetMapping(&quot;/hello&quot;)
    public String hello() {
        return &quot;Hello, REST!&quot;;  // returns as JSON or plain text
    }
}




Feature
@Controller
@RestController




Returns View?
Yes (by default)
No


JSON/XML by default?
No (@ResponseBody needed)
Yes


Use case
Web UI applications
REST APIs


Combines with
@ResponseBody
Already includes @ResponseBody</span>

What if your SaaS application could detect a cyberattack, recover from it, and keep running — without human help?
In this post, I’ll walk you through building a self-healing SaaS architecture using Django + Frappe, combining security automation, error detection, and real-time remediation — all in one stack.
Traditional SaaS platforms rely on:
Manual monitoring
Reactive fixes
Delayed recovery
In a world of zero-day threats and real-time exploits, this isn&#x27;t enough.
A self-healing SaaS:

✅ Blocks malicious behavior

✅ Automatically restores services

✅ Notifies only when necessary  



Component
Purpose




Django
Core backend &amp; API logic


Frappe
Metadata-based UI, DocTypes, and permissions


Celery + Redis
Background async healing tasks


Fail2Ban / UFW
Auto-blocking IP threats


Middleware
Attack detection &amp; real-time interception


Audit Logs
Track incidents &amp; healing cycles



Brute Force Login Attack



Middleware detects 5+ login failures from same IP

Stores event in logs

Triggers healing Celery task

Automatically:


Blocks IP via Fail2Ban/UFW

Restarts login module if crashed

Sends healing status alert
⏱️ Total recovery time: &lt; 3 seconds

👤 Human involvement: 0
🔐 Auto-heal authentication abuse

🚫 IP blocking on attack detection

🧰 Restart crashed worker queues (Celery)

🔄 Fix broken DocType workflows

📈 Live dashboards for threat metrics







  
  
  💡 Key Takeaways



Self-healing is not just a trend, it&#x27;s the future of cyber-resilient platforms.
Django + Frappe offer the perfect balance of flexibility, automation, and observability.
You’re not just building features—you’re building defense mechanisms into the fabric of your product.

A streaming platform wants to stream sport matches commented in English (of course completely legal) for Vietnamese viewers. They demand that the subtitle needed to be translated to Vietnamese with the lowest latency as possible. This blog is a PoC (Proof of Concept) for the translated streaming subtitle, using AWS Transcribe to transcribe the voice to text, Nova Micro to fix the text and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock to translate, with the support of serverless AWS ECS Fargate and Lambda.
Why not using Amazon Translate but use Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock? It is because the streaming videos are in special contexts, using sports vocabulary such as player names, item names which makes AWS Translate cannot identify and translate correctly.

Using OBS studio, a video stream is…</span>

This guide will walk you through setting up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Docker inside WSL on a Windows machine.
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
wsl --install

This installs Ubuntu as the default distribution. If WSL 2 isn&#x27;t already enabled, this command handles it too.

This will install Ubuntu. Once done, restart your PC to complete the setup.
After reboot, WSL will launch and prompt you to create a username and password.
If it doesn&#x27;t launch automatically, run:
wsl

Or launch Ubuntu from the Start Menu.
Inside WSL terminal:
sudo apt update &amp;&amp; sudo apt upgrade -y

                              <span>Nova funcionalidade: Agora é possível recuperar os nomes dos parâmetros de métodos e construtores usando reflection.
Como fazer:
Use o método getConstructor(...) para obter o construtor desejado.
Em seguida, chame getParameters() para obter um array de Parameter.
Use getName() para acessar o nome de cada parâmetro.
Importante!
Por padrão, os nomes exibidos serão genéricos (arg0, arg1).
Para ver os nomes reais, é necessário compilar o código com a flag:




-parameters


Exemplo com flag:
javac -parameters Usuario.java


Sem essa flag:
Antes do Java 8:
Dependia de bibliotecas externas, como o Paranamer:
Paranamer paranamer &#x3D; new CachingParanamer();
String[] parameterNames &#x3D; paranamer.lookupParameterNames(constructor);


Vantagens da nova abordagem:
Evita dependências externas.
Facilita o uso de reflection de forma mais limpa e segura.
🛠️ Como compilar com a flag -parameters:
javac -parameters Usuario.java ReflectionTeste.java


E depois execute:
java ReflectionTeste


🧾 Saída esperada (com -parameters):
true: nome
true: pontos


🔁 Saída sem a flag -parameters:
false: arg0
false: arg1


💡 Importante: Para que os nomes reais dos parâmetros apareçam (nome, pontos), compile com a flag -parameters.

Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been working through:
Calling methods from .NET classes with purpose


Understanding the difference between stateful and stateless methods


Using return values, parameters, and arguments effectively in method calls


Breaking down method signatures and experimenting with overloaded methods


Making the most of IntelliSense for smarter coding


Built a hands-on console app to generate larger numbers using System.Math

                              <span>In the rapidly evolving landscape of web development, managing authentication in a GraphQL API is crucial for securing data and ensuring a seamless user experience. With the growth of microservices and serverless architectures, it&#x27;s more important than ever to implement robust authentication mechanisms. Here’s a comprehensive guide on managing authentication in a GraphQL API in 2025.
GraphQL, a query language for APIs, allows clients to request only the data they need. This flexibility makes it popular in modern web applications. However, it also introduces unique challenges in securing endpoints and managing user access.
Authentication in a GraphQL API typically involves verifying the identity of a user or service interacting with the API. Once verified, the API can authorize the user to …</span>

                              <span>When building UI components, Its pretty common that we wanna trigger effects on component based on events on parent component, such as hovering. While applying style to components is straightforward, cross-component styling can become messy without proper control. The Blog explore an elegant solution using Compound Pattern to tackle the contextual styling challenge.
Applying a hover effect to a Button is fairly simple, A pure CSS solution is more than enough.
.Button {
  background-color: transparent;
  &amp;:hover {
    background-color: gray;
  }
}

What if we want to trigger styling transition when hovering on a parent component? Let&#x27;s say a Card. The intuitive solution is to let the parent component apply extra style to the Button.

                              <span>Not every week is about shipping cool projects, sometimes it’s just about testing.
I spent the week running through various LocalStack Pro sample apps to make sure everything worked as expected. What I didn’t expect was to get hands-on with a whole bunch of AWS services I’ve barely touched before (and a few I had honestly never even heard of).
SageMaker → Machine learning workflows


RDS → Managed relational databases


Neptune → Graph databases


Step Functions → Orchestration workflows


Glue → Data catalog and ETL


MQ → Managed message brokers


Route 53 → DNS and traffic routing



...plus the usual mix of storage, compute, and API Gateway goodness.
What stood out this week was how much you can learn just by doing. I didn’t plan to dive into graph databases or message brokers, but while debugging and tinkering, I picked up quite a bit.
Having everything local with LocalStack definitely made that exploration easier and less intimidating.
First things first: I need to finish my Meme App (priorities are priorities).
Once that’s wrapped, I’d like to turn some of this accidental learning into small demos and share tips on how to explore unfamiliar AWS services without the usual stress.
If you’ve ever gone down the AWS rabbit hole and come out the other side with new scars and skills, I’d love to hear your story too. Just hit me up on Twitter or LinkedIn. Catch y&#x27;all next week!</span>

When user clicks prev/next button, update query string (page, pageSize) via navigate() - this URL update does not reload the page.


At first load and when useEffect([location.search]) sees location.search (query string) changed, populateMyList() runs.


When populateMyList() fetches data, setMyList() and setLoading() are called. Those setState calls trigger a render to reflect the new data.

                              <span>Authorization isn’t just a checkbox in agentic systems. It’s a make-or-break layer for security, scalability, and trust. Without a clear way to authenticate dynamically, AI agents either hit brittle, hardcoded APIs or introduce serious security gaps. That’s why authorization has been one of the biggest missing pieces in the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
When MCP was first introduced, it focused on helping AI agents interact with APIs. But it left out that one critical capability: authorization. For the past six months, the MCP team has been working to change that, building a secure, dynamic authorization layer that can keep up with the unpredictable nature of agentic systems.
The new MCP authorization model is based on OAuth 2.1, as expected. But it also adds an important enhancement: supp…</span>

                              <span>Maybe Your Business Doesn&#x27;t Need an App.
Often, when I&#x27;m on discovery calls with potential clients, a common question arises: &quot;Do you think building an app for my business is a good idea?&quot; My response can sometimes be neutral—or even disappointing—but there&#x27;s an essential reason for that honesty.
Statistically speaking, about 90% of SaaS (Software as a Service) startups fail. This fact isn&#x27;t meant to discourage entrepreneurs but to inject a necessary dose of realism. As a software developer, I notice that of all the apps installed on my phone or computer, roughly 90% rarely get opened after the initial installation. Sure, some might be used weekly, like social media apps or games, but only a few become daily essentials. Think about your usage: development tools (Xcode, VS Code), browsers (…</span>

TL;DR: Skipping status reports in conditional branches causes silent delays and race conditions.
User delays
Poor Experience
Unpredictable timeouts
Incomplete initialization
Hidden dependencies
Policy mismanagement
Silent failures
Backward compatibility breaks
Validate all code paths
Use default reporting mechanisms
Test edge cases rigorously
Refactor policy checks early
Make Performance tests
Move reports outside conditionals
When you add conditional logic (e.g., group policies) to initialization code, skipping critical steps like readiness reports causes system-wide delays.
Edge cases are exceptional conditions that occur outside normal operating parameters.
When you don&#x27;t properly handle these edge cases, your code can behave unpredictabl…</span>

Spoiler: I didn’t.
Now, after rolling it out in real-world systems (and dealing with the chaos that followed), here are the 10 most valuable lessons I’ve learned—what worked, what broke, and how we made it through.
Even with Terraform and Ansible, subtle differences sneak in—especially after a few hotfixes. We had OpenSSL versions drift apart, and legacy clients couldn’t connect after a switch. Version control your infra and regularly diff live configs.
Schema changes are where blue-green deployments get risky fast. One rollout crashed due to a new JSONB column in green that blue’s ORM couldn’t handle. Solution? Versioned migrations…</span>

Hey fellow developers! 👋 Welcome to today&#x27;s JavaScript coding challenge. Let&#x27;s keep those programming skills sharp! 
Difficulty: Medium

Topic: Brackets and Parentheses
Write a function that checks if a given string has balanced brackets. The brackets to be checked are: parentheses (), square brackets [], and curly braces {}. A string is considered balanced if every opening bracket has a corresponding and correctly placed closing bracket. The function should return true if the brackets are balanced, otherwise false.

According to CNBC, Buffett reiterated that Greg Abel, the company&#x27;s vice chairman of non-insurance operations, who was previously named by Buffett as his successor, will take over. The Berkshire founder announced:
&quot;The time has arrived when Greg should become the Chief executive officer of the company at year-end, and I want to spring that on the directors effectively and give that as my recommendation.&quot;

In an interview with Cointelegraph, Glover said that holding onto the BTC carries several benefits including, price appreciation, tax deferment, and the potential to make extra revenue by lending out BTC held in corporate treasuries. The executive added:

The current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI), long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines.
In 2019, ETH/BTC fell over 90% in the prior two years, driven by the ICO collapse.

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 
Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.
Is Bitcoin mining profitable?
Bitcoin mining is still profitable. CoinShares, a digital asset investment firm, shared that the average cost to mine 1 BTC for US-listed miners reache…</span>

                              <span>Onchain social network Zora has built a reputation as a popular tool for artists, musicians and other creatives to monetize their content onchain, but the recent launch of its eponymous ZORA token has left many users confused and dissatisfied.
The token’s price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token’s distribution and utility models. 
This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.
With creators and builders shifting focus and NFTs no longer selling like they used to, does the ZORA token drop symboliz…</span>

Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. 
From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. 
Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how…</span>

The Dubai-based exchange, which processed $1.3 trillion in notional volume last year, is “actively reassessing potential opportunities” in the United States, CEO Luuk Strijers told the FT.
He cited the “recent shift toward a more favorable regulatory stance on crypto in the US” as a key motivator behind the decision.
Deribit’s potential plan to expand into the US comes amid reports that Coinbase is in advanced negotiations to acquire the platform.

“This post will describe how Ethereum 5 years from now can become close to as simple as Bitcoin,” Buterin wrote, arguing that simplicity is key to Ethereum’s resilience and long-term scalability.

“I’m not really into the whole Strategic Reserve situation,” Hayes said in a May 1 interview.
Hayes doubts any government announcing print money plans for Bitcoin 
“The United States is a deficit country; the only way they can do a Strategic Reserve is not sell the Bitcoin they took from people, fine, that’s 200,000 Bitcoin,” he said.

                              <span>Security tokens are blockchain-based representations of traditional financial assets—like shares, bonds, or investment contracts—that are subject to regulation. While launching a security token typically involves legal compliance and financial infrastructure, it’s still possible to prototype and build your own security token with no upfront costs using testnets and free open-source tools.
In this article, we’ll walk through how to build a security token smart contract, simulate regulatory features, and prepare for a future compliant deployment—all without spending a dollar.
A security token is a digital asset that represents ownership in a real-world, regulated asset. Unlike utility tokens, security tokens:

                              <span>Synthetic assets are one of the most exciting innovations in decentralized finance (DeFi). They allow you to create tokens that track the price of real-world assets—stocks, commodities, currencies—without actually owning them.
Imagine launching a token that mirrors the price of Tesla stock, gold, or even real estate… without needing to own those things or set up complicated infrastructure.
The best part? You can start building synthetic assets without spending money, using free open-source tools, testnets, and clever design.
This article walks you through the zero-cost path to building your own synthetic tokens.
A synthetic asset is a crypto token that represents the value of another asset. It’s a derivative that mimics the price movement of something else.

Outsourced is an ISO-certified offshore staffing company based in the Philippines that specializes in building full-time teams for its clients. Through offshore outsourcing with Outsourced, businesses can potentially save up to 75% on salaries compared to local hiring.
Outsourced was founded in 2012 by CEO Mike Larcher, who became frustrated with local hiring challenges in Australia. He found it difficult to find and retain skilled talent locally, which prompted him to look abroad.

Did you know the last commercial computer using 9-bit bytes was shut down only 30 years ago? That was the PDP-10—still running when C was dominant, C++ was just emerging (but not yet standardized), Java hadn’t launched (just one year before its release), and Python was still in development (two years before version 1.0).
That kind of diversity hasn’t gone away—it’s just shifted. Today:
There are 35+ active CPU architecture families: x86/64, Arm, MIPS, RISC-V, Xtensa, TriCore, SPARC, PIC, AVR, and many more

Some use unusual instruction widths (e.g., 13-bit for Padauk’s $0.03 MCU)

Not all CPUs support floating-point—or even 8-bit operations



And beyond the hardware:

Let&#x27;s be honest: AI is everywhere these days. From the apps on our phones to the tools we use at work, artificial intelligence is quietly (and sometimes not-so-quietly) reshaping how we get things done. But for many of us, the real magic happens when AI becomes a true partner, helping us brainstorm, automate the boring stuff, and even spark a little creativity when we need it most.
If you&#x27;ve ever wished you could have a super-smart assistant right in your terminal, or wondered how to use AI in ways that are actually practical (and not just hype), you&#x27;re in the right place. In this post, we&#x27;ll explore the world of AI chatbots and command-line tools, share some best practices for getting the most out of AI, a…</span>

Thanks to open-source tools, free resources, and a bit of creativity, it’s entirely possible to build a secure, functional crypto token or coin on a budget of exactly $0.
In this article, I’ll walk you through how to do just that—without sacrificing quality, security, or credibility.
If you&#x27;re building a cryptocurrency on a budget, the Ethereum blockchain is a great starting point. More specifically, the ERC-20 token standard lets you launch a new token by simply writing and deploying a smart contract.
You don’t need to build your own blockchain, manage nodes, or run any servers. Instead, you leverage the security and reliability of Ethereum’s existing infrastructure.

                              <span>Hi there, I wanted to make this post to recommend some tools that helped me personally as a React Developer over the past 3 years. 
LinkedIn 
This article will only cover VS code extensions that helped me during development. Some of these tools were introduced to me by a friend of mine. You can search for them in the VS extension marketplace 👍
It integrates Draw.io into your VScode. Making creating diagrams a lot easier. This tool is useful for creating a mockup design for the frontend of the web application. 
This is probably one of my favorite Git VScode extensions. A really great tool for visualizing your Git repository commits. I use it to track the commits I made. If you are working with another developer, you can see the commits made by each other in different color trees.
This is a tool that has helped me categorise my projects. I have made a lot of projects and they tend to be scattered. This tool helped me organise them into blocks. Clicking on them takes me to the project workspace immediately.
One of my favorite tools in my VScode workspace. This extension allows you to store you previous terminal session. You can create a configuration, these configuration can store a set of terminal commands. This is great for variety of functions, like Dockerization, Database migration, and API testings.
This is probably my favorite tool out of all the extensions. It prevents the need to add a console.log in my JS files. I can see the output clearly in the console. It boosts my productivity a lot , and I recommend it the most.
I hope this article helped with your workspace productivity. 
Happy coding ! 😄</span>

Permission Testing Toolkit is a CLI utility built with TypeScript that allows teams to validate, simulate, and test their fine-grained access control logic using Permit.io.
✅ It supports both manual test cases via JSON and dynamic test generation using your live Permit.io schema.

✅ It’s perfect for CI pipelines or security-conscious teams that want to &quot;test their policies before they break production.&quot;

✅ Oh — and it looks nice in your terminal too. 🎨
You write the rules. This CLI makes sure they&#x27;re followed.

                              <span>Let’s be honest—JavaScript has been misunderstood for too long. Too many people assume it’s complicated, messy, or only for “real” programmers. But that’s far from the truth.
The reality is: JavaScript is not that hard.
In fact, once you understand its core principles, it’s one of the most intuitive, flexible, and powerful languages you can learn. It powers nearly everything you see on the modern web. And with the right guide, learning JavaScript can not only be simple—it can be fun.
That’s exactly why I wrote the ebook JavaScript is Not That Hard—to prove that anyone can learn JavaScript, even if they’ve never written a single line of code before.
Let’s break this down:
The Syntax is Human-Friendly
if, else, and function—and they just make sense.

                              <span>Na parte 1 desta série, vimos como o Module Federation permite compartilhar componentes entre diferentes aplicações sem precisar instalar pacotes ou duplicar código. Agora, vamos dar um passo além: como enviar dados de uma aplicação para outra.
Imagine que você tem dois apps:
🔵 MF Consumer  — quem consome um componente remoto
🟢 MF Provider  — quem disponibiliza esse componente
conforme a imagem abaixo:

Vamos supor que o MF Provider tenha um componente chamado App que precisa exibir os dados de um usuário ( nome e email ). Esses dados vêm diretamente do MF Consumer.
No MF Consumer, tem o seguinte:

MF Consumer
Aqui, criei um objeto user e passei como props para o componente Provider , que está vindo do MF Provider.
No lado do MF Provider , defini o tipo das props ( ProviderProps ) e usei os dados recebidos normalmente, como faríamos em qualquer componente React, como segue:

MF Provider
Não é magia. É só React com Module Federation! Ao consumir um componente remoto, você ainda pode passar props normalmente, como se ele fosse local. Isso funciona porque, por baixo dos panos, o Webpack cuida de toda a importação remota — mas o React continua funcionando do jeito que a gente conhece.
Com isso, conseguimos:
Importar um componente remoto com Module Federation
Passar dados para esse componente via props
Exibir esses dados no MF Provider como se tudo estivesse rodando no mesmo app
Acompanhe AQUI como ficou o resultado final.
No próximo artigo, vou mostrar como esse padrão pode ser estendido para eventos e callbacks entre MF Consumer e MF Provider (ex: o usuário clica em algo no Provider e o Consumer reage).

With a simple .yaml file, this nifty tool is capable of providing a containerized workbench with PHP, a MariaDB/PostreSQL database, and Mailpit. It&#x27;s perfect for anything from WordPress to the most complex Symfony app. However, out of the box it&#x27;s not tailored to be used alongside Node. Granted, it does come bundled with Node pre-installed, but if you want to use your PHP backend with a TypeScript frontend, it requires a tiny bit of configuration. This is what this article is about. It is inspired by Andy Blum&#x27;s blog post over at Lullabot. My approach is similar but a bit simpler.

                              <span>No meu artigo anterior, mostrei como montei um projeto com Micro Frontends usando Rsbuild, Module Federation, pnpm e Lerna , tudo rodando num monorepo. Agora, quero dar um passo além e explicar o “porquê” dessa escolha.
É uma forma de compartilhar código entre diferentes aplicações em tempo de execução. Funciona como se um app pudesse importar um componente diretamente do outro — sem instalar, copiar ou duplicar código.
Exemplo real no meu repositório:
📦 mf_provider(chamo de componente filho): expõe um componente Button
📦 mf_consumer_(_chamo de componente pai): consome esse mesmo Header, remotamente, sem precisar tê-lo no código local
✅ Evita reescrever os mesmos componentes em diferentes apps (pelo menos tenta)
✅ Permite deploys independentes (independência de times)
✅ Melhora a escalabilidade de grandes projetos
✅ Facilita refatorações e testes A/B isolados
✅ Acelera o desenvolvimento com reuso real de UI e lógica
“Você não precisa de Micro Frontends… até precisar.”
Nem todo projeto precisa disso.
🔸 Se o projeto é pequeno e centralizado, pode ser complexidade desnecessária
🔸 Se as equipes compartilham tudo e fazem deploy juntos, MF talvez seja overkill
🔸 Se o bundle não é um problema, pode usar libs compartilhadas internas

                              <span>Two months into my no-code-writing development experiment, I&#x27;ve started to reflect on what I&#x27;ve gained and lost in the process.
There are clear wins: faster prototyping, more exploratory design conversations before touching code, and almost no actual coding (which is a huge relief, I&#x27;m more of an organize-ideas person, not a coder).
I followed the tools&#x27; lead intentionally, curious to see what they had to offer. But in doing so, I slipped back into early-career patterns, prioritizing feature work and not handling code smells up front. I lost my Monday-ness.
I&#x27;m a code whisperer. A wild west code wrangler. The one who could reshape entire systems by refactoring in their sleep.
In this post, I want to return to the process that made that kind of work possible. The one that helped me grow fro…</span>

                              <span>It&#x27;s me. I want to learn back end. If you do too, maybe I can help you out.
Lets back up a little bit. I am a front end web developer, and I have noticed a flaw in my peers. It is not always present, but it is certainly prolific. For a job that is existentially deep learning, there is very little focus on how we learn. As a college educator this has always stuck out to me. We know we want to learn backend. But how do we learn back end? That&#x27;s what I want to help you with. 
In my humble opinion our job isn&#x27;t necessarily to write code. Our job is to provide value to others by solving problems. Code just happens to be the most effective tool for that. I find it&#x27;s helpful to approach the the question of how do we learn backend like any other problem. Let me share one of the most valuable tools…</span>

                              <span>API versioning via headers is a powerful way to evolve your API without breaking existing clients. 
Here&#x27;s a deep dive into what it is, why you&#x27;d use it, and a step-by-step guide to implementing it in Express.
1.Separation of Concerns
Versioning in headers keeps your URL space clean - clients still call /users instead of /v1/users or /v2/users.
2.Content Negotiation
HTTP was designed around content negotiation. You can leverage the Accept header or a custom header (e.g. X-API-Version) to tell your server which variant of the response to emit.
3.Granular Control
You can version on a per-resource or even per-field basis depending on header values.

                              <span>💡 Quer estudar, prototipar ou estruturar um projeto com MF (Microfrontend) de forma modular e performática?
Nos últimos dias, mergulhei em um experimento que pode facilitar (e muito!) a vida de quem trabalha com micro frontends no dia a dia.
🎯 Criei um repositório open source usando:
Rsbuild (alternativa moderna e rápida ao Webpack)
Module Federation para isolar e compartilhar componentes entre apps
pnpm + Lerna pra orquestrar tudo de forma leve e organizada
📂 Estrutura simples, mas poderosa:
apps/mf_provider: expõe componentes
apps/mf_consumer: consome via Module Federation
Tudo rodando em paralelo com pnpm dev
🔗 Confere lá e, se curtir, arrocha um like ou manda feedback!
Repositório no Github
O pnpm tem um recurso bem legal chamado Catalogs. Ele serve para definir versões de dependências como constantes, que podem ser reutilizadas nos módulos internos dentro do package.json de cada projeto.
Exemplo:
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
# Define a catalog of version ranges.
catalog:
  react: &quot;^18.3.1&quot;
  react-dom: &quot;^18.3.1&quot;

# Nos módulos internos, consigo reutilizar a versão definida no pnpm-workspace.yaml
  &quot;dependencies&quot;: {
    &quot;react&quot;: &quot;catalog&quot;,
    &quot;react-dom&quot;: &quot;catalog&quot;
  }

Outra curiosidade bem legal é a praticidade que o Lerna oferece na criação de um monorepo, permitindo executar vários apps juntos de forma paralela com um único comando, como no exemplo abaixo:
&quot;dev&quot;: &quot;lerna run --parallel dev&quot;,

Rsbuild + Module Federation se mostrou extremamente simples de estruturar e entender, especialmente se comparado ao uso do plugin com Webpack. No próximo artigo, trarei um exemplo utilizando Vite para termos uma ideia prática.
Até mais.
Curtiu a ideia ou tá explorando algo parecido? Bora trocar ideia.

  Historical Context


The Gamepad API represents a significant leap in web technology, providing developers with the ability to access gamepad inputs natively within a web browser. Before this API, developers often relied on browser support for other technologies, such as Flash or native applications, to create engaging gaming experiences on the web. The introduction of the Gamepad API in the late 2010s marked a paradigm shift; it allowed developers to create immersive gaming experiences that can fully leverage console-style gamepad controls within HTML5 applications.
The specification for the Gamepad API was drafted in the W3C Gamepad Community Group and has seen constant evolution since its inception. As of late…</span>

Data lakes and data warehouses each brought strengths and limitations to the way organizations manage analytics. Lakes offered flexibility and scale, but lacked consistency and performance. Warehouses delivered speed and structure, but often at the cost of rigidity and duplication. The data lakehouse aims to unify the best of both worlds.
In this post, we’ll explore what a data lakehouse is, how it differs from its predecessors, and why it represents a fundamental shift in mo…</span>

In this blog post, i will walk you through the proces of installing and customizing an Apache web server on linux system (Ubuntu). this project has helped me understand the practical steps of web server setup and give me hands on experience with customizing a live webpage.
step1: Chosing the Web Server


For this project, i decided to chose Apache due to its long-standing popularity, extensive documentation and ease of usage.
step2: Installing Apache


First of all, i had to update my package list to make sure the latest software version is available.
sudo apt update

Next, i installed Apache with the command
sudo apt install Apache2

step3: verifying the installation


To verify that Apache is runing, i use the command 
sudo systemctl status apache2

In the growing creator economy, YouTube channels pump out tons of videos every week. and Creators need a simple dashboard that answers the following questions:
How has my channel grown over time?
What is the best day and time to post a video?
What are the most engaging videos in my channel?
To tackle this, I built an end-to-end data pipeline that automatically pulls, processes, and visualizes YouTube data.
In this article goes over the steps I took to archieve this.
Instead of using Docker,I installed everything natively because it gave me more control, better performance tuning, and more flexibility compared to containerized environments.
Apache Airflow schedules and manages all the ETL jobs automatically.

As data systems grow more complex, understanding where your data came from, how it has changed, and who is responsible for it becomes just as critical as the data itself. It’s not enough to know that a dataset exists—you need to know how it was created, whether it’s trustworthy, and how it fits into the broader system.
In this post, we’ll break down three interconnected concepts—metadata, data lineage, and governance—and explore why they’re essential to building transparent, …</span>

Behind every useful dashboard or analytics report lies a well-structured data model. Data modeling is the practice of shaping data into organized structures that are easy to query, analyze, and maintain. While it may sound abstract, modeling directly impacts how quickly and accurately data consumers can extract value from the information stored in your systems.
In this post, we’ll look at the foundations of data modeling, the difference between OLTP and OLAP systems, and comm…</span>

Let’s upgrade that.
If you&#x27;re working on API testing, test metrics, or even CI/CD pipelines — you can automate beautiful chart-based reports and export them as PDFs. 
Stakeholders/ TL love visuals. 
Devs love clarity. You can have both.

In this blog, I’ll show you how to:
Generate charts (bar, pie, line) using Chart.js or QuickChart

Export those charts (and test data) to PDFs using Puppeteer, jsPDF, or PDFKit

Use them in API testing, test coverage reports, and performance metrics

The fintech revolution is coming, and at its core lies one of the most underrated innovations of our time — the blockchain ledger. This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies or buzzwords. It’s about the raw cryptographic power that makes trustless, decentralized finance possible.
Welcome to Episode 1 of our new video series breaking down the XRP Ledger (XRPL) — one concept at a time.
🎥 Watch on YouTube
In this episode, we dive into the two cryptographic pillars behind the XRPL and modern blockchain systems:
Hashing: Immutable fingerprints for any data
Encryption: Protecting the integrity and privacy of transactions
Why Hashing ≠ Encryption (and why that matters)
How the XRPL uses these concepts under the hood
Whether you&#x27;re new to Web3 or building on XRPL, these are tools you must understand.
Most developers know what a hash function is. Fewer understand why it&#x27;s critical in blockchain consensus, how it supports immutability, or how encryption standards impact financial systems at scale.
This series will bridge that gap — starting here.
SHA-256
Public/Private Key Encryption
XRP Ledger’s core protocol
Blockchain developers
Fintech engineers
XRPL builders
Anyone curious about real-world cryptography in action






📢 Follow the series — we’ll be breaking down the XRPL layer by layer, from consensus algorithms to smart contract integration (Hooks), and more.

                              <span>With Angular 19, you can build apps using pure standalone components, ditching NgModule entirely. Lazy loading is cleaner than ever using the loadComponent() method with route-based dynamic imports.
In this post, we’ll walk through creating a Pokémon type navigator (Fire, Electric, Water) using Angular 19 + lazy-loaded standalone components — no modules required.
✅ Use loadComponent() with Routes

✅ Declare and lazy load standalone components

✅ Create route-driven Pokémon screens
✅ No NgModule needed!

It is a cloud-based, agentic development environment designed to accelerate the building, testing, deployment, and running of production-quality AI applications—all within a unified platform.
📦 Conclusion
Whether you&#x27;re building a simple blog or a complex real-time app, Firebase provides a comprehensive toolkit. The Firebase Console gives you a powerful cloud dashboard, while the Emulator Suite allows you to develop and test locally like a pro. Together, they form what many developers refer to as &quot;Firebase Studio&quot; — your command center for rapid, scalable, and secure app development.</span>

Resource                     Free Tier
EC2 Type,                    t2.micro / t3.micro (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM)
Java 17 (Temurin),               CLI-based

IntelliJ IDEA Graphical IDE      BEST BET IS LOCAL


IntelliJ on EC2: While technically possible with X11 forwarding or a remote desktop, it&#x27;s not recommended on Free Tier due to performance constraints. Use IntelliJ on your local machine, and treat EC2 as the remote runtime/server.

Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide to get you set up:
Step 1: Set up your React Native project
If you already have a React Native project, you can skip this step.
If you&#x27;re starting fresh, create a new React Native project using your preferred method (React Native CLI or Expo).
React Native CLI:
npx react-native init MyAwesomeApp
cd MyAwesomeApp

Expo:
npx create-expo-app MyAwesomeApp
cd MyAwesomeApp

Step 2: Install NativeWind and Tailwind CSS
Now, let&#x27;s add the necessary packages:

                              <span>In 2015, launching a SaaS product that actually worked was impressive.
You didn&#x27;t need a community.
You just needed to build it.
But today? Building is easy. Too easy.
AI writes your backend.
Execution is no longer your moat.
Everyone has the same tools.
You&#x27;re not competing on what you build.
how it feels to use your product.
That&#x27;s the new edge: emotional connection.
Not because it&#x27;s nice to have
only thing left that&#x27;s hard to copy.
Let&#x27;s be honest.
Most SaaS products today are perfectly functional.
You sign up, click around, maybe submit feedback, then never hear back.
It&#x27;s all so… sterile.
The most beloved products don&#x27;t just solve a problem.

They:
Communicate
Listen
Evolve in public
Make you feel like you&#x27;re part of something
It&#x27;s not about being flashy or &quot;fun.&quot;

                              <span>Most APIs were built for humans.
We wrote docs assuming someone would read them. We wrapped our endpoints in auth flows and user interfaces. We expected a person, or maybe a service, on the other side.
But that’s already changing.
AI models are now consuming APIs directly. Not as passive data readers, but as active participants. They parse user intent, synthesize context, and trigger backend actions. They&#x27;re not just clients. They&#x27;re intermediaries.
And that changes everything.
When models call APIs, natural language stops being enough.
We like to imagine that models “understand” prompts, but in practice, they just compute probabilities over sequences of text. They don’t grasp nuance the way humans do. A tiny shift in phrasing can derail the whole interaction.
That makes coordination betwe…</span>

                              <span>The 2025 McKinsey report on AI in the workplace reveals an important data point. Employees are more prepared for AI than most leaders realize. 
According to the report, 94% of employees have some familiarity with generative AI tools. Most execs estimated 4% of their teams already use AI heavily at work. However, the real figure is 12%, three times higher.

Even skeptics are on board. The report labels cautious employees as &quot;Gloomers&quot; (37% of the workforce), who want tight AI oversight, and &quot;Doomers&quot; (4%), who distrust AI outright. Yet 80% of Gloomers and 50% of Doomers say they’re comfortable using AI at work. That shows widespread readiness, not just enthusiasm from the usual suspects.

✅ Automated dynamic prompts and data modeling
from contextgem import Aspect, Document, DocumentLLM

# Define what to extract
doc &#x3D; Document(raw_text&#x3D;&quot;Your document text here...&quot;)
doc.aspects &#x3D; [
    Aspect(
        name&#x3D;&quot;Intellectual property&quot;,
        description&#x3D;&quot;Clauses on intellectual property rights&quot;,
    )
]

# Extract with any LLM
llm &#x3D; DocumentLLM(model&#x3D;&quot;
/&quot;, api_key&#x3D;&quot;&quot;)
doc &#x3D; llm.extract_all(doc)

# Get results
print(doc.aspects[0].extracted_items)

Features a native DOCX converter, support for multiple LLMs, and full serialization - all under Apache 2.0 permissive license.

                              <span>When working with Mongoose and TypeScript, two helper types make your life much easier:
/**
 * Extracts the “plain” shape of your schema—
 * just the fields you defined, without Mongoose’s built-in methods or &#x60;_id&#x60;.
 */
export type User &#x3D; InferSchemaType;

/**
 * Represents a fully “hydrated” Mongoose document:
 * your fields plus all of Mongoose’s methods and metadata
 * (e.g. &#x60;_id&#x60;, &#x60;save()&#x60;, &#x60;populate()&#x60;, etc.).
 */
export type UserDocument &#x3D; HydratedDocument;

export const userModel &#x3D; model(&quot;user&quot;, userSchema);

InferSchemaType


• Produces a pure TypeScript type from your schema definition.
• Use it whenever you need just the data shape (e.g. DTOs, service inputs/outputs).
HydratedDocument


• Wraps your base type T with Mongoose’s document helpers.
• Use it for any function that deals with real, database-backed 
For example, in a repository interface you might write:
export interface IUserRepository {
  findOneByEmail(email: string): Promise;
  findById(id: Types.ObjectId): Promise;
  create(
    createUserDto: Pick,
  ): Promise;
}

Here, each method clearly promises a “live” Mongoose document (with built-in methods) while elsewhere you can rely on User for pure data shapes—keeping your boundaries and types crystal clear.

In contrast to batch processing, where data is collected and processed in chunks, streaming data processing deals with data in motion. Instead of waiting for data to accumulate before running transformations, streaming pipelines ingest and process each piece of data as it arrives. This model enables organizations to respond to events in real time, a capability that’s becoming increasingly essential in domains like finance, security, and customer experience.

For many data engineering tasks, real-time insights aren’t necessary. In fact, a large portion of the data processed across organizations happens in scheduled intervals—daily sales reports, weekly data refreshes, monthly billing cycles. This is where batch processing comes in, and despite the growing popularity of streaming, batch remains the backbone of many data-driven workflows.
In this post, we’ll explore what batch processing is, how it works under the hood, and why it’s…</span>

- UseMemo :
In JavaScript, objects and arrays are passed by reference. This means that during a re-render, even if their content doesn&#x27;t change, a new reference is created.
UseMemo come to address this issue and returns a memoized value.

                              <span>1. Introduction to Hybrid Architectures


Hybrid architectures combine elements of client-server and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems.

Goal:  
Take advantage of both models (client-server manageability + P2P scalability).

Solve the problems of purely decentralized systems (for example, low reliability or &quot;freeloaders&quot; in P2P).







  
  
  2. Edge-Server Systems (Systems with edge servers)



  
  
  2.1. Definition and location in the network




Edge servers are located at the junction of networks:


Between the corporate network and the Internet (for example, for Internet service providers — ISPs).

Between users and the core of the Internet (for example, CDN servers).






Examples:
Cloudflare and Akamai servers.


Local caching proxies at the ISP.

An ML project to empower smarter agriculture decisions
GitHub Repo →
Agriculture remains the backbone of the Indian economy, yet farmers still face unpredictable yields due to varying environmental and input conditions. To tackle this issue, I built a machine learning model that predicts crop yield based on historical and input-based features.
This project is simple, beginner-friendly, and practical.
&quot;How can we accurately predict crop yield based on inputs like rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide use?&quot;
Farmers often rely on experience or guesswork. This model helps bring data-driven decision-making to the field.
The dataset includes:
Area
Production
Crop Year
Rainfall
Fertilizer
Pesticide
📌 Categorical features are label-encoded for model compatibility.
Python 🐍
Pandas &amp; NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (optional for plots)
I trained and evaluated three regression models:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor ✅ Best performer



  
  
  Evaluation Metrics:



R² Score
Adjusted R²
RMSE
Gradient Boosting gave the highest R² score on the test set and was chosen as the final model.
The script allows users to input values for the features and get instant yield predictions.
Clone the repo and run the script locally:
git clone https://github.com/h4ck3r0/crop-yielding-prediction
cd crop-yielding-prediction
python main.py

Add UI with Streamlit or Flask
Integrate with real-time weather APIs
Visual analytics for predictions
This is a practical application of ML in solving a real-world agricultural problem.

Simple experiment, obviously that 
This experiment shows that, ideally, a secure encryption scheme should give an attacker a probability of guessing bit b, tending to 1/2 (or 50%).

important:

Definition 3.18 says that a private key encryption scheme is secure when used repeatedly if an adversary (e.g. hacker) cannot distinguish the encryption of two different sets of messages.  
1.Security with multiple encryptions:
The enemy selects two sets of messages (for example, two lists).


One of them is encrypted, and the enemy is trying to guess which one it is.

If the scheme is secure, his chances of guessing are only slightly better than just flipping a coin (that is, 1/2 + very small value).

Once data has been ingested into your system, the next step is to prepare it for actual use. This typically involves cleaning, transforming, and storing the data in a way that supports analysis, reporting, or further processing. This is where data pipelines come in, and at the center of pipeline design are two common strategies: ETL and ELT.
Although they may look similar at first glance, ETL and ELT represent fundamentally different approaches to handling data transformation…</span>

It&#x27;s important to prevent this information from being exposed in CLI output, logs, or source control.

Before we can analyze, model, or visualize data, we first need to get it into our systems. This step—often taken for granted—is known as data ingestion. It’s the bridge between the outside world and the internal data infrastructure, and it plays a critical role in how data is shaped from day one.
In this post, we’ll break down the types of data sources you’ll encounter, the ingestion strategies available, and what trade-offs to consider when designing ingestion workflows.

Using AI to Generate Seed Data for Supabase
Every developer knows the importance of having good seed data for fast testing and development. Manually crafting SQL queries to populate your database with realistic data can be tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex relationships between tables.
SupaSeeder connects to your Supabase instance, extracts the database schema, then you can either generate SQL insert statements or optimized prompts to use with any AI model to generate the seed data you need.
supaseeder.vercel.app 🔥

                              <span>In the world of software development—especially with distributed systems and microservices—asynchronous messaging has become essential for building scalable and resilient applications. Two of the most common messaging patterns are queues and topics. While they might sound similar, their behavior and use cases are quite different.
In this post, I’ll explain what they are, how they differ, and when to use each one.
A queue follows a point-to-point communication model: messages are sent by a producer and consumed by only one consumer. Once a message is processed, it is removed from the queue.
Key characteristics:
Each message is processed by one and only one consumer.
Guarantees single delivery of each message.
Useful for load balancing between multiple consumers.

However, the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() method forces the persistence context to synchronize with the underlying database immediately-without ending the transaction. This can be a game-changer for scenarios where you need to validate constraints or trigger database actions before the transaction completes.
But here’s the catch: improper use of 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() can lead to unexpected behaviors, performance overhead, or even data inconsistencies if not handled carefully. It&#x27;s crucial to know when and why to use it, especially in complex microservices or batch processing environments.
How do you approach transaction management and flushing in your Spring Boot projects? Have you ever faced a tricky bug or performance issue related to this? Share your experience or tips in the comments-let’s learn from each other!

I&#x27;ve always wanted to write a blog and create a tech YouTube channel — I think having a blog will have to be enough for now.

Well, my name is Rodrigo. I&#x27;m a recent CS graduate, and honestly, I&#x27;m just trying to understand where I fit in all of this.
I&#x27;ve always done a lot of things during college — organized events, created personal projects for the CS community at UFCG (which is the university I graduated from), and even joined a handful of partnership projects between the university and different companies.
It was great, don&#x27;t get me wrong. These were amazing experiences. But by the time I reached my final semesters, I thought I had everything figured out. I knew how to get into projects, how to organize events that really worked, and I felt like t…</span>

Conclusion
Dependency Injection (DI) is one of the most debated design patterns in software development. While opinions vary on whether it’s universally beneficial, one thing is certain: DI can be extremely useful if not treated as a &quot;golden hammer.&quot; Overusing it, such as blindly injecting every dependency, can lead to unnecessary complexity rather than cleaner code.
In this article, we’ll explore how DI can be effectively applied in Next.js, striking the right balance between maintainability and simplicity.

Hello friends, SQL (Structured Query Language) is one of the most essential skills for any Software Engineer. I would rate this skill as similar to system design and coding. 
If you are a professional programmer, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether you are a Java, Golang, or .NET developer; you are bound to write SQL queries. 
Since the database is an integral part of any modern Java or Web application, the Interviewer always preferred candidates with excellent SQL skills. 
Now, the big question comes: How can a programmer learn SQL? Is knowing how to query a table enough? If you remember insert, update, delete, and select, then are you a…</span>

                              <span>Vector search is becoming a core workload for AI-driven applications. But do you really need to introduce a new system just to handle it?
We ran a performancebenchmark to find out: comparing PostgreSQL (using pgvector + pgvectorscale) with Qdrant on 50 million embeddings.
Sub-100ms query latencies
471 queries per second (QPS) on Postgres—11x higher throughput than Qdrant (41 QPS)
Head to the full write-up for a deep dive into our vector database comparison.

At 99% recall, Postgres delivers sub-100ms query latencies and handles 11x more query throughput than Qdrant (471 QPS vs. Qdrant’s 41 QPS).
The results show that thanks to pgvectorscale, Postgres can keep up with specialized vector databases and deliver as good, if not better performance at scale. Learn more about why Postgres wins for AI and vector workloads.
How? We built pgvectorscale to push Postgres to its limits for vector workloads—without compromising recall, latency, or cost-efficiency. It turns your favorite relational database into a high-performance vector search engine.
✅ No extra systems.
✅ No new query languages.
✅ Just Postgres.
We used RTABench to run a transparent, reproducible evaluation—designed for real-world, high-scale workloads.

                              <span>What is DevOps?


DevOps, as the name suggests, combines Development and Operations into a unified approach. A DevOps Engineer orchestrates the entire journey of an application: planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying, and monitoring. This comprehensive process ensures applications work seamlessly for end-users and integrate properly with other services.
I see DevOps Engineers as master planners who understand the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Success in this role requires both technical expertise and strong communication skills. Communication becomes crucial especially when coordinating across different teams – from developers to stakeholders.
Planning begins with constructive thinking about the development and production environments where code will b…</span>

So this post was inspired by that conversation, and I hope it helps anyone else who is looking to try it out.  In a previous post I introduced how Amazon Q CLI now supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) (check out Configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Amazon Q CLI for more details). 
This post will build on that and show you how to run MCP Servers via container images. As I switched to using Finch from Docker back in 2024, I will be using that - this means if you are using something different to Docker, like Podman for example, you should be able to follow along and use that tool too.

Welcome back to the last part peer review of the France Data Engineering Job Market Analysis pipeline. In Part 1, we explored the project’s infrastructure, cloud setup, and orchestration. Now, we’ll go deeper into the heart of the data platform: transformations, data warehouse design, dashboarding, reproducibility, and actionable feedback.
Modern data engineering pipelines are built on modular, testable transformations—and dbt (Data Build Tool) shines in this space. This project structures its dbt codebase into staging, core, and marts layers, following best practices for maintainability and scalability.
Staging Models: Clean and standardize raw job posting data.
Core Models: Build core analytical tables, e.g., fact_jobs, dim_company, dim_skills.

HTTP is the foundation of everything we build and interact with on the web — whether it’s a static website, a complex Single Page Application (SPA), a RESTful API, or a modern mobile app.
Every user action that triggers data exchange — from submitting a login form to loading an image — ultimately depends on HTTP.
Despite this, many developers treat HTTP as a black box: something that “just works” behind the scenes. While abstraction is useful, serious web developers must move beyond it.
Understanding how HTTP actually operates — from how requests are structured, to how connections are established, to how responses are transmitted — is essential for building high-quality, secure, and performant applications.

Welcome to the third peer review series for DataTalks Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp. In this post, I’ll be dissecting a real-world data engineering project that analyzes the French Data Engineering job market. The goal? To break down the project’s infrastructure, orchestration, and cloud design—spotlighting what works well, what could be improved, and, most importantly, what we can all learn as practicing data engineers.
Why do this? Because reviewing and sharing feedback on real-world projects sharpens our own skills, encourages open knowledge sharing, and helps us all grow together. Let’s dig in.

                              <span>The world of online dating has changed dramatically in the past few years — and artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a major role in that transformation. One emerging trend is AI dating pictures: profile photos generated or enhanced by AI to help users present their “best selves” on dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, or even social media platforms.
But what exactly are AI dating pictures, and are they a good idea? Let’s break it down.
AI dating pictures refer to profile photos that are either:
✅ Generated entirely by AI — using tools like AI portrait generators or avatars based on your real face.
✅** Enhanced or edited by AI** — improving lighting, removing blemishes, sharpening features, or even subtly reshaping facial features.
These photos aim to make you look more appealing wit…</span>

                              <span>When I started working with Dynamics CRM, ages ago, there were 2 topics that were the nightmare of all CRM devs:
Multi currency, aka exchange rate management
Time-zone management
Ages have passed, but those topics keep staying in the top 5 chart of my headaches-giver topics.
Just today, scrolling in my LinkedIn wall, I&#x27;ve found an interesting article from Nick Doelman that pointed to another article from 2021 where he solved the long-standing issue of updating exchange rates in the platform in an way that is
straightforward
elegant
deterministic
fast to set-up
and, above all, free!
It&#x27;s just a matter of leveraging the right tools, that in this case are:
https://exchangeratesapi.io/: a website that provides daily updated exchange rates with a compelling licensing model that allows up to 100 api calls per month for free!
a simple Power Automate flow.
Take a look at his article for details!
🙏🏻 Thanks Nick!

This is my story.
I had just graduated from university, full of fire and ambition. My degree wasn’t in tech, but I was drawn to the world of possibilities I saw in it. 
This was in the early 20-teens, and the buzzword floating everywhere was “Fullstack Developer.” YouTube was overflowing with success stories, “I went from zero to six figures in a year,” “How I became a Fullstack developer without a CS degree.” It was intoxicating.

Kepler is a monitoring and observability tool designed for Kubernetes clusters that uses eBPF to track the resource usage of containers and nodes. Unlike traditional monitoring solutions, which often rely on metrics collection agents running in user space, Kepler utilizes eBPF to gather resource consumption data directly from the kernel. This results in high precision and low overhead, which is essential for cloud-native environments.
Kepler is particularly useful for:
Resource Efficiency: Kepler provides detailed resource usage metrics for containers and Kubernetes workloads, allowing users to optimize resource allocation and avoid over-provisioning.

.json files?


You might be laughing a bit here. Of course .json and js goes hand in hand. Since the beginning of time we have used .json files to throw in config, mock data or see how many levels of data-indentation we can reach before we go crazy.
Well, what I want to do is have a data.json file where I &quot;mock&quot; all the data I want/need for a page so:
In practise this means I can simply import my file, and since I am not crazy and love using TypeScript, I can also type my data:
import rawData from &quot;./assets/data.json&quot;;

const myData: UserAboutMe &#x3D; rawData as UserAboutMe;

You start with enthusiasm, binge a few lessons, and then… confusion. What’s the difference between Flexbox and Grid? Why does your CSS break on mobile? How do you even land a job after this?
You’re not alone. The tech industry is flooded with resources claiming to teach you web design in weeks, but most leave you stuck in tutorial hell — overwhelmed, under-skilled, and unsure how to turn coding into a career.
Enter Ace Web Academy — a web design course built for people who want to skip the fluff and land a job. Let’s break down why structured learning beats solo Googling every time.

For developers working in blockchain and fintech infrastructure, this is more than a market headline—it’s a potential stress point for applications reliant on real-time price data, order execution, and network performance.
Understanding these macroeconomic triggers is critical for building resilient crypto-native systems.
Bitcoin is currently trading near the $59,000–$60,000 support zone after facing rejection from resistance at approximately $63,000 earlier this week. Despite brief recoveries, sentiment remains cautious ahead of economic data releases.

From voice assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced algorithms that recommend what we watch, buy, or read, AI is transforming industries and enhancing user experiences worldwide.
One of the most exciting aspects of AI is its ability to adapt and learn. Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows systems to analyze patterns, make predictions, and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. This is particularly useful in fields like healthcare, where AI is used to detect diseases from scans, and in finance, where algorithms assess risk and detect fraud in real time.

                              <span>🧵 Interfaces in Java, explained like you&#x27;re 5!



  
  
  1️⃣ Imagine a Pizza Menu 🍕


You walk into a pizza place and see a menu. The menu promises what pizzas they offer—but doesn’t make them yet.

An interface in Java is like that menu: it defines what a class should do, but not how!  
The menu says:  
&quot;All pizzas must have cheese 🧀&quot;

&quot;All pizzas must be bakeable 🔥&quot;
Any chef (class) who follows this menu must fulfill these rules! In Java, we call this &quot;implementing an interface.&quot;







  
  
  3️⃣ Multiple Menus, One Chef!


A chef can follow multiple menus (interfaces):  
Italian food menu 🍝

Fast food menu 🍔
Similarly, a Java class can implement many interfaces at once! (Unlike inheritance, where you only get one parent.)







  
  
  4️⃣ But… What If the Chef Cheats? 😱


If a chef says, &quot;I’ll follow the pizza menu!&quot; but doesn’t add cheese… BIG PROBLEM!

Java won’t allow this—it forces the class to implement every method in the interface, or the code won’t compile!  
What if some pizzas usually have tomato sauce, but not always?

Interfaces can now provide default methods—like a &quot;standard recipe&quot; that chefs can override if they want!  

java
interface Pizza {  
    default void addSauce() { System.out.println(&quot;Adding tomato sauce!&quot;); }  
}</span>

                              <span>From this article 2 Minute Tips: The Dark Secret of Optionals I got to know that the Optionals are nothing but an Enum . I started experimenting: How can we build Optional from scratch
You might have heard of Schrödinger’s Cat — the thought experiment where a cat in a box is both alive and dead until you check. That&#x27;s basically an Optional, right? A value that might exist... or not.
So, let&#x27;s turn this idea into code:
enum 📦 {
    case 😺(Value)
    case 😵

    init(_ from: Value) {
        self &#x3D; .😺(from)
    }
}

Now we can do:
let x: 📦 &#x3D; .😺(123)
let y: 📦 &#x3D; .😵

But that&#x27;s not quite as convenient as Swift&#x27;s native syntax: let x: Int? &#x3D; 123.
Can we make ours feel just as nice?
Swift lets types conform to ExpressibleByNilLiteral. Let’s do that:

Have you ever paused to wonder what really happens when you book a movie ticket online? What unfolds behind the scenes when you check show details or reserve your favorite seat? I’ve always been fascinated by the complexity beneath that simple click-and building SkyFox Cinema gave me the perfect opportunity to explore it firsthand.
SkyFox Cinema is a modern, full stack movie booking platform designed to help regional theaters embrace digital transformation. My goal was to empower local cinema owners with a robust, scalable system that leverages the latest in software engineering practices-while also challenging myself to solve real-world business and technical problems (this was a fictitious scenario I created for myself).

                              <span>The success of a mobile app heavily depends on its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). A well-designed app is intuitive, engaging, and keeps users coming back. On the other hand, a poorly designed app frustrates users, leading to uninstalls and negative reviews. With millions of apps competing for attention, a flawless UI/UX design can be the game-changer that sets your app apart.
Users appreciate an app that is easy to navigate. A cluttered and confusing interface overwhelms users, leading to higher bounce rates. Simplicity doesn’t mean your app should be bare-bones, but rather that it should be free from unnecessary elements that distract from the core functionality.
Minimize distractions by using a clean and structured layout. Every element should have a clear purpose.

Genymotion is by far the most widely used Android device emulation tool for auditing Android apps, due to its practicality and some of the features it offers. You can install it directly from the official website. It is worth remembering that Genymotion is, in principle, based on VirtualBox. It is worth remembering that Genym…</span>

                              <span>We need ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to enable communication between devices on a local network. Specifically, ARP is used to map an IP address (logical address) to a MAC address (physical address), which is necessary for data transmission at the data link layer.
ARP is a Layer 2 protocol used in IPv4 networks to map a known IP address to its corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) address. While IP addresses help devices find each other logically, MAC addresses are what Ethernet networks use to actually deliver packets. ARP acts as the translator between these two.
IP works at Layer 3 (Network Layer) but to actually send data over Ethernet (Layer 2), the system needs the MAC address of the destination device.

O Facade é um padrão de projeto do tipo estrutural. Ele consiste na criação de uma classe intermediária (ou fachada) que expõe uma interface simplificada para um conjunto de classes ou processos mais complexos.
Seu principal objetivo é desacoplar a lógica de negócios da complexidade de múltiplas instâncias e chamadas internas, permitindo que outras partes do sistema interajam com uma interface unificada e mais limpa. Isso melhora a organização do código, facilita a manutenção e reduz a dependência direta de implementações internas.

                              <span>Have you ever wondered how applications like hotkey managers or keystroke recorders work their magic? How do they intercept keystrokes even when they&#x27;re not in focus? The secret lies in something called &quot;keyboard hooks&quot; - a powerful yet somewhat mysterious feature of Windows programming.

In this blog post, we&#x27;ll demystify global keyboard hooks by building a simple WPF application that listens for the F1 key press anywhere in Windows. Whether you&#x27;re a beginner looking to understand Windows hooks or an experienced developer wanting to implement global hotkeys, this guide will walk you through the process step by step.
💪 Power in Your Hands: Once you master keyboard hooks, you can completely customize Windows&#x27; keyboard behavior - redirect keys to launch applications, block problematic keys,…</span>

In this guide, we&#x27;ll explore effective techniques for intercepting and blocking unwanted network requests in Puppeteer.
Blocking unnecessary requests offers several benefits:
Faster page loading - Skipping images, analytics, and ads can dramatically reduce load times
Reduced bandwidth usage - Especially important for cloud-based scraping or serverless functions
Lower memory consumption - Fewer resources to process means less memory used
Improved stability - Fewer network requests means fewer potential points of failure

Why do we need a typography component?
Consistent typography is key to keeping your website looking clean and organized. Without it, things can start to look messy fast. A typography component helps keep text styling uniform across your whole site. The idea here is to make it both flexible and well-defined, so you get a good balance between structure and creativity, since not everything is just black and white. ‘</span>

                              <span>Welcome to part 4 in the series of shell scripting. Today we will look at a script that goes through an array with complex values. Complex values such as spaces, apostrophes, and quotes.
Scripting is the process of writing a set of instructions in a programming or scripting language to automate tasks that would otherwise be done manually. In the context of shell scripting, these instructions are written for the command-line shell, allowing users to perform complex operations - like file management, backups, or software installations - with just a single script execution. It&#x27;s a powerful tool for saving time and ensuring consistency in system administration and development workflows


Create the script in VIM, complex_list.sh



Write and save the script in VIM.



We can check whether it has been created  by doing ls -ltrh.



Give the permission so the script can be executed.



If we then do a ls –ltrh we can see the script has gained a green colour, meaning that it is now executable.



Output after executing the script by using the command ./




  
  
  Stay tuned, part 5 in the series coming tomorrow!

                              <span>Excelorithm, we build custom software solutions for startups, SMEs, and enterprise clients alike. And as the technical head here, I’ve seen a recurring pain point — many teams, including our own, spend way too much time setting up the basics of a SaaS product: authentication, subscriptions, dashboards, role management, notifications...
Sure, there are tons of SaaS starter kits out there, both free and premium. They promise speed — and often deliver — but usually at a hidden cost: vendor lock-in.
Many popular boilerplates rely on proprietary services, paid APIs, or tightly coupled ecosystems. That might be fine early on, but over time it limits your freedom, raises your costs, and ties you to someone else’s roadmap.
That’s why we built SaaSLaunchpad — a free, open-source Next.js SaaS starter kit with zero paid tool dependencies and no vendor lock-in.

Fair source software is a licensing model designed to balance the freedom of open source with the revenue potential of proprietary software. This blog post explores the history, core concepts, practical applications, challenges, and future innovations of fair source software. By blending aspects of open access with commercial monetization, fair source software offers an alternative ecosystem where developers can engage communities while earning sustainable revenue. We also compare fair source with traditional licensing models using tables and bullet lists for clarity. Furthermore, we discuss additional facets such as funding strategies and legal complexities that shape this emerging model in the digital landscape.

                              <span>INTRODUCTION:
But exactly is the purpose of the Node Operators in the Catalysis Ecosystem? well let&#x27;s get into that now.
They power the services (AVSs) by doing important technical tasks.
They also help protect the network by locking up funds (called 
staking)—this keeps them honest.
If they do something wrong, they can lose money so they have a 
strong reason to act fairly.
I&#x27;m pretty sure at this point you can fairly understand why they are called the backbone of the network. Basically without them nothing would work.
HOW DOES CATALYSIS WORK IN RELATION TO THE NODE OPERATORS?
Normally, running these services on many platforms is complicated and 
expensive.
Catalysis simplifies this by giving them one tool (Catalyst-CLI) 
to manage everything in one place.

Any service that&#x27;s meant to live more than couple of weeks eventually reaches the stage where you feel the need to properly monitor it. You usually start with simple console.log logging, but soon realize it&#x27;s not readable enough, it&#x27;s not searchable enough and it&#x27;s only available on your server. Probably inside Docker container.
I was exactly at that point, annoyed by constant need to ssh into my server to check one log line. I&#x27;ve wanted to play with Grafana ecosystem for a while, too. So it seemed to be the perfect moment.
In this post, I’ll walk you through a simple and minimal setup that streams my Node.js application&#x27;s logs into the Grafana Cloud dashboard using Grafana Alloy and Loki. 
This is what my final setup looks like:

                              <span>As deep learning models grow in size and complexity, the demand for efficient computation has never been higher. One of the key contributors to computational efficiency in machine learning is the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). In 2025, PyTorch continues to set the benchmark for leveraging GPU acceleration. This guide delves into the steps and nuances of using GPU acceleration in PyTorch.
GPUs are designed to handle parallel operations, making them perfect for the complex computations required in training deep learning models. Using a GPU, you can significantly speed up processes such as matrix operations and tensor computations.

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Two Pointers, String, Dynamic Programming
There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.
After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.
You are given a string dominoes representing the initial state where:

                              <span>By default, Spring Data JPA loads related data lazily, which can cause the N+1 problem — one query for the main data and more for each related item. @EntityGraph annotation fixes this by letting you load related data in a single query, without changing your entity mapping. It’s simple, improves performance, and avoids writing custom JOIN FETCH queries.
Let’s say you have a Post entity that references an Author.
Entities
@Entity
public class Post {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String title;

    @ManyToOne(fetch &#x3D; FetchType.LAZY)
    private Author author;
}

@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}

Repository
public interface PostRepository extends JpaRepository {

    // attributePaths specifies related entities to eagerly load
    @EntityGraph(attributePaths &#x3D; {&quot;author&quot;})
    List findAll();
}

Now, if you create a simple controller to return all posts and have SQL logging enabled, you&#x27;ll see the queries printed in the console.
With @EntityGraph, only one query runs to fetch both the post and its author. Without it, multiple queries are executed — one for the posts and one for each author — which is the N+1 problem.
✅ Using @EntityGraph
Only one query — fast and efficient.
select p.id, p.title, a.id, a.name
from post p
left join author a on p.author_id &#x3D; a.id

🚨 Not Using @EntityGraph
N+1 queries — slow and wasteful.
select * from post;
select * from author where id &#x3D; ?;
select * from author where id &#x3D; ?;</span>

To explore this question, I launched an experimental project: a sommelier chatbot. Wine is a domain rich with variety and unfamiliar terms—perfect for testing how helpful an AI assistant can be in guiding users through complex needs and how naturally it can be integrated into a real application interface.
This project focused on:
Designing an AI chatbot that recommends wines through real-time conversation
Embedding the chatbot within an actual chat interface
Gaining insights on conversational UX—such as message flow, context awareness, and user engagement

                              <span>A construção de aplicações com Large Language Models (LLMs) evoluiu rapidamente. Frameworks como LangChain nos deram as ferramentas para conectar LLMs com fontes externas, memória, e agentes capazes de tomar decisões. Mas à medida que a complexidade dos fluxos aumenta, surge um desafio comum: como orquestrar o comportamento dos agentes de forma flexível, controlável e com lógica mais rica que simples pipelines lineares?
É aqui que entra o LangGraph.
O que é o LangGraph?


O LangGraph é uma extensão do LangChain que permite construir fluxos de execução orientados a grafos para LLMs e agentes. Em vez de seguir uma sequência fixa de passos (como num pipeline tradicional), você define nós (nodes) e arestas (edges) que representam o comportamento dinâmico do sistema.

                              <span>Issues with Existing Formatting Tools


When working with data structures like lists or NumPy arrays in Python,

the standard print or pprint, or even external tools like rich, often fail to provide a clear view of the entire structure,

especially when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or deeply nested data, making it easy to lose track of which element corresponds to which.
Let&#x27;s consider the following example as an illustration.
sample &#x3D; [
    {&quot;user&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: 1, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;scores&quot;: [95, 88, 76]}},
    {&quot;user&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: &quot;002b&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;scores&quot;: [72, 85, 90]}},
    {&quot;bug_user&quot;: {&quot;id&quot;: [3], &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;scores&quot;: [100, [50, 40], 70]}},
]

 — The “Pitfalls” of Data Structures


Python&#x27;s lists, dictionaries, and NumPy arrays are fine to work with for simple structures.…</span>

                              <span>Key takeaways:

BTC hit $97,900 due to soaring institutional investor demand, but futures pricing shows traders aren&#x27;t confident in a sustained rally.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows.

BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs).

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23, roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token.  
“I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News.

                              <span>Ethereum’s relative dominance among layer-1 (L1) blockchain networks has declined, resulting in an “open race” to become the leading Web3 platform, according to Alex Svanevik, CEO of data service Nansen.
“If you’d asked me 3–4 years ago whether Ethereum would dominate crypto, I’d have said yes,” Svanevik said during a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event. “But now, it’s clear that’s not what’s happening.”
Ethereum is still the most popular L1 network. According to data from DefiLlama, its roughly $52 billion in total value locked (TVL) represents 51% of cryptocurrency residing on blockchain networks.
However, Ethereum’s dominance has diminished sharply since 2021, when the L1 controlled as much as 96% of aggregate TVL, the data shows.

&quot;This is a big signal. When a city like Cannes, known globally for culture and commerce, starts integrating crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 payments aren’t just a niche thing anymore. It’s about proving that crypto can work in everyday settings, not just online or in theory.&quot;

Analyst predicts a low VIX (

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score below 18 implied a “risk-on” environment, favoring assets like Bitcoin. 
Peterson’s model, which had a 95% tracking accuracy, predicted a $135,000 target within the next 100 days if the VIX remains low. This aligns with Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, as a low VIX reduces uncertainty, encouraging investment in ri…</span>

                              <span>The cryptocurrency market continued its recovery in the past week as the total crypto market capitalization breached the $3 trillion mark for the first time since the beginning of March.
Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an over two-month high of $97,300 last seen at the end of February, before the “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in the US, bolstering analyst predictions for a rally driven by “structural” institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows into the world’s first cryptocurrency.
Risk appetite continued rising among crypto investors, as Chinese state-linked news outlets indicated that the Trump administration has quietly contacted Beijing to discuss tariff reductions.

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

Born in 2013 as a private placement, GBTC pioneered regulated Bitcoin investment, granting investors access to Bitcoin’s (BTC) meteoric rise without the perils of digital wallets or unregulated exchanges.
On Jan. 11, 2024, it transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF following a landmark victory against the SEC. This marked a pivotal moment with the SEC’s view that ETFs can offer lower expense ratios and enhanced tax efficiency compared to traditional funds. 
Even still, GBTC’s financial resilience shines, generating $268.5 million in annual revenue, surpassing the $211.8 million of all other US spot Bitcoin ETFs combined, despite losing over …</span>

Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.
Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure. 
It enables developers and engineers to build a censorship-resistant and accessible open-data web to champion the cause of free speech. Open-source technology creates a paradigmatic shift in a fair and inclusive internet where centralized web companie…</span>

After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.
The firm’s shift to a Bitcoin-only approach comes as ETH has lost 45% of its value year-to-date, with some optimists speculating that ETH is potentially close to the bottom and reversing its negative trend soon.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP’s strongest spot premium phase suggests real buying demand, not just speculative futures trading. 

The number of XRP addresses holding ≥10,000 tokens has steadily climbed, even during recent price pullbacks. 

A falling wedge pattern points to a possible breakout toward $3 to $3.78, with up to 70% upside if confirmed.

XRP (XRP) is experiencing its strongest sustained phase of spot premium in history, a period where the spot market has been consistently trading at stronger levels compared to perpetual futures.
XRP’s 350% rally is backed by real demand  
Since 2020, most major XRP price peaks happened when the perpetual futures market was leading, noted market analyst Dom in his May 2 post on X.

                              <span>Bitcoin’s recovery to its all-time high may be threatened by rising recession fears, which could ease if the United States and China begin tariff negotiations this month, research analysts told Cointelegraph.
Appetite for global risk assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) may take another hit, with analysts from Apollo Global Management predicting a recession by the summer.
“Apollo predicting Summer Recession: Sharpest decline in earnings outlook since 2020,” cross-asset analyst Samantha LaDuc wrote in an April 26 X post.
The progress on the tariff negotiations may be the most significant factor impacting a potential recession and Bitcoin’s price trajectory, according to Aurelie Barthere, principal research analyst at crypto intelligence platform Nansen.

                              <span>The United Kingdom’s financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), plans to stop retail investors from borrowing money to fund their crypto investments.
According to a May 2 Financial Times report, the ban on borrowing to fund crypto purchases is one of the upcoming crypto rules by the FCA. David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, told the FT that “crypto is an area of potential growth for the UK, but it has to be done right.” He added:
“To do that we have to provide an appropriate level of protection.”
Geale denied claims that the FCA is hostile to the crypto industry. Instead, he explained that he views the industry as offering high-risk investments with less consumer protection. “We are open for business,“ he said.

                              <span>On Wednesday, speaking from the White House, US President Donald Trump suggested that families scale back on gifts this year.
Asked about his tariff program, the president remarked, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.’”
But the toy stores where those dolls are sold might have something to say about it. 
Earlier in the week, Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota joined a growing number of American small businesses suing the president over his emergency tariff plan.
Throughout April, a groundswell of lawsuits led by 13 states further challenged Trump’s ambitious tariff program. Their success or failure rests on hundreds of years of judicial policy an…</span>

On March 21, South Korean regulators ordered Google Play to block access to exchanges that were not compliant with the requirements needed to operate in the country. On April 11, South Korea’s Financial Services Commission (FSC) ordered the Apple Store to block unregistered crypto exchanges. 
KuCoin was among those affected by the country’s crackdown on unregistered platforms that were previously available. While the platform is now unavailable to South Koreans, it has not fully abandoned the jurisdiction.

Anyone who has used traditional payment systems will likely be familiar with refunds and chargebacks. If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.
However, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.

Bitcoin long-term holders are about to hit a level of unrealized profit, which has traditionally caused them to sell.

That level coincides with the return to a six-figure BTC price.

Order book data suggests that bulls may not succeed in keeping the upside going.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “notable increase” in selling from its older investors if price rises further, warns onchain analytics firm Glassnode.
In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” researchers calculated that long-term holders (LTHs) are sitting on almost 350% unrealized profits.

From addressing challenges like verification in the artificial intelligence era to bringing internet connectivity to developing countries, projects are integrating blockchain to solve problems in different industries.

Lately, stablecoins are everywhere — this time around, headed by “traditional” financial institutions. Bank of America and Standard Chartered are considering launching their own stablecoin, joining JPMorgan, which launched its stablecoin, JPM Coin — rebranded as Kinexys Digital Payments — to facilitate transactions with their institutional clients on their blockchain platform, Kinexys (formerly Onyx). 
Mastercard plans to bring stablecoins to the mainstream, joining Bleap Finance, a crypto startup. The aim is to enable stablecoins to be spent directly onchain — without conversions or intermediaries — seamlessly integrating blockchain assets with Mastercard’s global payment rails.

When the lines blur between man and machine, you’re looking at artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition.
AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality.

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin (BTC) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs. However, that’s since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post.
“Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a gamble mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach,” he said.
“This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains,” Quinlivan added.

The agency didn’t give a reason for wanting to dismiss its case, but said its decision “does not necessarily reflect the Commission’s position on any other case.”
Balina told Cointelegraph in March that the SEC had informed him it would recommend the court dismiss the case and claimed the agency’s actions were based on a shift in the agency’s priorities.

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token.
If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled.
Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.”

Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview.
Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used.

                              <span>Tether, the company behind the world’s largest stablecoin by market capitalization, has released its financials for the first quarter of 2025, disclosing nearly $120 billion in exposure to US Treasurys and over $1 billion in operating profit.
According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets.

According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company&#x27;s excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Despite weak US manufacturing data, Federal Reserve liquidity plans and strong corporate earnings keep equities and crypto afloat.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March.

Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “decoupling” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&amp;P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment.

In an interview with Cointelegraph&#x27;s Sam Bourgi at Token2049, Elissar said that stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, the intersection between AI and crypto, alternative use cases such as decentralized science, and Web3 gaming were all niches the company is exploring.
Gaming is &quot;part of our DNA,&quot; the executive said before reflecting on the current state of the Web3 gaming industry:

                              <span>Despite reports in February suggesting that 2 million pro-crypto voters could decide the outcome of this week’s Australian Federal Election, crypto has barely rated a mention during the campaign.
“I think it’s a missed opportunity,” Independent Reserve founder Adrian Przelozny told Cointelegraph. “Neither side has made crypto a headline issue because they’re wary of polarizing voters or sounding too niche.”
But the good news is that after more than a decade of inaction, both the ruling Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the opposition Liberal Party are promising to enact crypto regulations developed in consultation with the industry. 
In April, Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor promised to release draft crypto regulations within the first 100 days after taking office, while the Treasury itself h…</span>

According to reporting from Inner City Press, a judge sentenced Eisenberg to 52 months in prison at a May 1 hearing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case was filed in April 2024 after Eisenberg’s 2023 indictment on fraud for the Mango Markets exploit.
Eisenberg was initially scheduled to be sentenced in July 2024 following his guilty plea on the child porn charge. In May 2024, the judge suggested the sentencing for both cases would occur simultaneously in a consolidated proceeding. However, as of May 1, the fraud sentencing remains …</span>

Michael Saylor&#x27;s Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has reported earning a year-to-date yield of 13.7% on its Bitcoin holdings as it missed Wall Street&#x27;s first-quarter estimates.
The company said in its May 1 earnings statement that its year-to-date Bitcoin (BTC) yield equates to a gain of more than 61,000 BTC, worth approximately $5.8 billion. Bitcoin yield and gain are unofficial accounting metrics Strategy uses to benchmark the success of its BTC buys. 
Strategy’s chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, said it would increase its Bitcoin yield target for this year to 25% and its Bitcoin gain target to $15 billion.

In a May 1 letter to Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) — the entity responsible for managing the US government’s properties — Rep. Lance Gooden claimed that introducing crypto ATMs to federal buildings would serve as an “educational resource” and reflect advances in financial technology. He requested that the GSA begin exploring the necessary guidelines and regulations needed to install such ATMs in government-controlled properties across the US, citing alignment with President Donald Trump’s goals.

&quot;Every retail user should be thinking about getting at least one Bitcoin — very soon they won’t be able to afford it,” Kunz said. 
If the United States starts buying Bitcoin for a strategic reserve, even smaller countries may soon struggle to acquire the cryptocurrency, he added. &quot;I’m pretty sure we’ll soon see countries battling over who owns more Bitcoin. The US will start.”

Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by August or September of this year if BTC breaks above the parabolic slope pattern. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price jumped to new quarterly highs at $96,700 on May 1, a day after the US GDP contracted -0.3% for the first time since Q2 2022. Amid heightened economic concerns, the probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut rose to 62.8% for the June 18 Federal Reserve meeting. 
Over the past 24 hours, short position liquidations exceeded $137 million, with Alphractal founder Joao Wedson observing that BTC&#x27;s price momentum continues to favor bullish trends.

The decision was shared in a May 1 X post, with Coinbase citing the token’s failure to meet its listing standards. The price of the MOVE token also declined by approximately 14.5% in the last 24 hours. Coinbase specified the details of the suspension in an announcement:
&quot;Trading for MOVE will be suspended on Coinbase, Simple and Advanced Trade, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. We have moved our MOVE order books to limit-only mode. Limit orders can be placed and canceled, and matches may occur.&quot;

&quot;General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance. Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call — the rollup grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance.&quot;

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security.

                              <span>The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

                              <span>Major European cryptocurrency investment firm 21Shares has filed for a spot Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, marking another step in its expansion to the US market.
21Shares on April 30 submitted the Form S-1 registration for a spot Sui (SUI) ETF to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Called the 21Shares Sui ETF, the proposed ETF will issue common shares of beneficial interest by seeking to track the performance of SUI held by 21Shares’ US subsidiary.
The US filing comes a year after 21Shares started trading the 21Shares Sui Staking exchange-traded product in Europe in July 2024, with its first listings on Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam.

Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…</span>

According to a May 1 Bloomberg report, the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026. The plan is still in early development, and the bank is said to be exploring partnerships with established crypto firms to power the service. Internal discussions about cryptocurrency support reportedly began in late 2024.

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates sooner than expected.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

Technical charts currently show XRP (XRP) trading within a falling wedge pattern. A &quot;falling wedge&quot; is a bullish reversal chart pattern that comprises two converging trend lines that connect lower lows and lower highs. This convergence indicates weakening downward momentum.

                              <span>Trading platform Robinhood has still managed to beat Wall Street estimates as its first-quarter revenues fell and its crypto trading volume cooled from a record high in Q4.
Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.
Crypto trading volume on Robinhood also fell 35% over Q1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, which the firm attributed to a 10% drop in customer trades placed and a 27% fall in average notional volum…</span>

                              <span>Key points:

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

This technical blog post outlines the implementation of a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Amazon Nova Act on Amazon ECS Fargate platform as a container, providing browser automation capabilities as a service. 
Amazon Nova Act is an early research preview AI model and SDK designed to enable developers to build reliable web agents that can perform actions within a web browser. By integrating Nova Act with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), its browser automation capabilities can be standardized and exposed to diverse clients (e.g., AI assistants, web UIs, IDE extensions) through multiple communication channels:
Standard I/O (stdio) for local scripting and CLI tools like Amazon Q Developer CLI &amp; Cline VS Code Extension (open-source)

Imagine you&#x27;re sitting in your favorite coffee shop, casually browsing your bank account on public Wi-Fi. Everything looks normal—padlock icon, HTTPS, the familiar interface. But in the shadows, a silent observer is watching, recording, and possibly altering everything you send. This is not science fiction; it&#x27;s the chilling reality of a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack.
With the explosion of remote work, IoT devices, and public connectivity, MITM attacks are more relevant than ever. For developers, IT professionals, and security teams, the danger lies in the illusion of secure communication. The article you&#x27;re about to read dives deep into how these attacks operate, the real-world damage they cause, and how to guard against them.

【技術課題】
【提案】
・検索強化推論（検索＋推論の複合的ワークフロー）をマルコフ決定過程（MDP）として定式化し、最適な行動（検索するかどうか）を逐次選択。
【効果】

図２はDeepRAGの全体像であり、この仕組みでRetrieval Narrative(クエリ分解) と atomic decision(検索するかしないかの判断)を行う。
DeepRAGでは、検索強化推論のプロセスを以下の4つの要素からなるMDPとしてモデル化する：​
各ステップにおける状態は、元のクエリとそれまでのサブクエリとその応答の履歴 


  (q1,r1),…,(qt,rt)(q_1, r_1), \ldots, (q_t, r_t)(q1​,r1​),…,(qt​,rt​)

で構成される。
各ステップでの行動 

  at+1a_{t+1}at+1​

 は、以下の2つの行動から成る：
終了判定（Termination Decision）: 次のサブクエリ 

  qt+1q_{t+1}qt+1​

 を生成するか、最終的な回答

  ooo

を出力してプロセスを終了するかを決定。
検索判定（Atomic Decision）: 次のサブクエリ 

  qt+1q_{t+1}qt+1​

                              <span>What is Conditional Rendering?


In React, conditional rendering allows you to dynamically render different UI components based on certain conditions. You can use JavaScript logic such as if statements, the ternary operator (? :), the logical AND (&amp;&amp;), or assign JSX to variables.
Using if Statements


The simplest way to conditionally render components is by using if statements inside a function component.
Example:





function AlertMessage({ show }) {
  if (!show) {
    return null;
  }
  return 
This is an alert message!
;
}

export default function App() {
  return ;
}

In this example, if show is false, the component returns null and nothing is rendered.
Using Ternary Operator (? :)


The ternary operator is a compact way to return di…</span>

                              <span>MongoDB has been a popular database choice for JavaScript developers for years, thanks to its flexible document model and natural fit with JavaScript objects. While MongoDB&#x27;s native driver and tools like Mongoose offer ways to work with the database, Prisma ORM provides a complementary approach that enhances the development experience.
MongoDB stores data in collections of JSON-like documents with flexible schemas. This flexibility enables rapid iteration and adaptability to changing requirements. Prisma ORM complements this flexibility by providing:
Type-safe database access: Generated TypeScript types based on your schema.

User submits comment form (via Turbo).
Rails controller saves comment, sets flash[:notice]

Rails renders create.turbo_stream.erb

The turbo_stream.append renders the _toast.html.erb partial with the flash message
The browser receives the Turbo Stream response.
Turbo appends the new toast HTML (containing data-controller&#x3D;&quot;toast&quot;) into the

Have you ever run a SQL query that just took forever and wondered, &quot;Why is this so slow?&quot; You&#x27;re not alone. Databases are fast until they&#x27;re not. And one of the simplest, yet most powerful performance tricks in SQL is indexing.
What indexing really means in MySQL 


Why indexes are performance game changers


The exact results of an experiment we ran on 80,000+ records in 


MySQL 5.7 on a local setup (8GB RAM, SSD)


When indexing helps and when it doesn&#x27;t



Let&#x27;s dive in.

Think of an index like a book&#x27;s table of contents. If you need Chapter 8, you don&#x27;t flip through every single page you jump straight to it. That&#x27;s what MySQL does with an index.
Primary Index(based on the primary key)
Unique Index (for ensuring uniqueness)
Composite Index (on multiple columns)

Hello everyone! Welcome to the second entry in my reading journey series. This time I have managed to read only 5 books. While I’m a little bit behind on my Goodreads goal of reading 52 books in the year, the last couple of months have been very busy with the end of the academic winter term. Now that I’m done with classes, I’m sure that I can have more time for reading and hopefully catch up to my goal. Let’s go into the reviews for this entry!

I briefly mentioned in the last entry that I was starting to read a collection of Celtic fairy tales and lore that my dad gifted me for Christmas. The first book in this collection is Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland by Lady Wilde. It contains a varied recollection of folklore and fairy tales.
Overall, I liked…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
After doing my first job as a frontend engineer in a startup for an year, I left my job. Their are multiple reasons for it, but that was the story of another time.
After that I decided to not pursue the tech career and start my chocolate factory - HAKI, a chocolate spread idea that crossed my mind.


If anyone is thinking, why making a chocolate spread would be so hard, like I thought initially, my 1st two variants caught fungus within a week.

Long time, messaging a hundred people for advice and many failed attempts, now I&#x27;m here finally — with the most delicious recipe made using clean, wholesome ingredients to keep it truly healthy.
Ahh and please follow Haki on @eathaki_ to know more about it.

We&#x27;re still on the lookout for a graphic designer who&#x27;s excited to help build HAKI — feel free to drop me an email if someone comes to mind.
Thank you so much for reading it till here 😊

Also, if there&#x27;s a better place to share this, please let me know.</span>

I previously served as the General Secretary of an association based in Brisbane. Throughout the year, we host around three events where professional photographers capture numerous high-quality images. Some of these photos can be as large as 18MB.
Once the events conclude, the pictures need to be uploaded to Google Albums and shared with our community. At our most recent event, the total upload size reached 5GB.
I had previously implemented an image resizer in php which I executed by running
php process.php imageprocessing  [ []]

The files in the input folder were processed sequentially, which worked well for a small number of images and for smaller file sizes—around 5MB. 
However, when handling a large volume of files, the process became …</span>

                              <span>One of the most popular JavaScript libraries for developing user interfaces is React. React&#x27;s component-based design enables developers to deconstruct intricate user interfaces into smaller, more manageable components. However, the quality of the React components could decrease as applications get bigger and more complicated, resulting in jumbled, difficult-to-maintain code.
The best approaches to developing cleaner React components will be discussed in this post. This useful tutorial will help you increase readability, maintainability, and performance whether you&#x27;re new to React or trying to make your current codebase better.

                              <span>Modern .NET applications often rely on external services for data, messaging, and more.
Here are a few problems you can suffer when calling external APIs:
Transient failures: An external service might be slow or unreachable for a brief moment.
Partial outages: Another system could be in maintenance mode, limiting your access.
Network instability: Users with slow internet connections might experience short outages or timeouts.
Overloaded service: Another service could be overloaded with requests, leading to slow responses.
Networks are unstable, and you will suffer such problems sooner or later.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a modern approach to provisioning cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or OpenTofu. These technologies improve scalability, repeatability, and automation—but they can also introduce security risks if the code is misconfigured. For example, exposing an S3 bucket to the public or disabling encryption can lead to serious data breaches.
This article introduces CoGuard, a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool designed specifically to analyze configuration files used in infrastructure code. We’ll demonstrate how to scan Terraform code, interpret results, and automate the scanning process in a CI/CD workflow.

Firefox is a powerful, free, and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. The journey of Firefox began in **2002, when it was initially launched under the name *“Phoenix”. Due to trademark conflicts, it was later renamed *“Firebird”, and finally, in **2004, it became known as *“Firefox”*.
The main objective was to offer a lightweight, secure, and flexible browser alternative to the then-dominant Internet Explorer. Firefox quickly became popular due to its faster performance, tabbed browsing, and support for third-party **extensions (add-ons).
Over time, Firefox introduced several innovations such as:
Private Browsing Mode
Enhanced Tracking Protection
Reader Mode
Quantum Engine for improved speed and performance
Today, Firefox remains one …</span>

Using var Instead of let and const


We all know JavaScript has come a long way, but some developers still rely on var. This can lead to unexpected behavior due to its function-scoped nature. let and const are block-scoped, providing better predictability in your code.

                              <span>In the cloud-native era, where speed, scalability, and automation dominate, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a critical practice for DevOps and platform engineering teams. Tools like Terraform, Pulumi, and OpenTofu allow infrastructure to be defined, versioned, and deployed with the same rigor as application code.
But just like any other code, infrastructure code is prone to security misconfigurations, errors, and vulnerabilities. A single misconfigured security group or publicly accessible storage bucket can result in devastating data breaches. This is where SAST tools for IaC play a vital role.
Among the many open-source tools available, KICS (Keeping Infrastructure as Code Secure) stands out for its breadth of support, ease of use, and community-driven rules engine. In this a…</span>

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, 2025 has ushered in a paradigm shift known as vibe coding. Coined by AI researchers, vibe coding represents a transition from traditional, syntax-heavy programming to a more intuitive, AI-assisted approach where developers articulate their intentions in natural language, and AI tools generate the corresponding code.
At its core, vibe coding is about conveying the desired functionality or behavior of software through conversational prompts. Instead of meticulously writing out code line by line, developers describe what they want the software to do, and AI models translate these descriptions into executable code. This method emphasizes clarity of thought and design over manual co…</span>

Will AI Take My Job?

Sure, we code daily and AI shines at spitting out code. But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.
Apart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:
Inter-team planning
Brainstorming sessions
Putting late sprints back on track
Designing requirements and user stories
Decomposing a full project into milestones
Scoping tasks with Product people
Reviewing architecture designs
Negotiating deadlines
Talking to clients
And that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can&#x27;t replace that human interaction yet.
But sure, our job as coders will change. Even if we&#x27;re skeptical about AI, we can&#x27;t ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us. We have to adapt.
We won&#x27;t be code monkeys anymore, cracking lines of code in exchange for bananas. AI will handle that. And if AI will change everything, let it at least kill dumb SCRUM ceremonies.

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

                              <span>The crypto industry has seen a significant shift toward regulatory compliance since its early days, according to James Smith, co-founder of Elliptic, a crypto compliance firm established in 2013.
“In the early days, only a few companies approached compliance in a serious way,” Smith told Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event. “Coinbase was our first customer — they knew from the start that they wanted to build their business that way. But for most others, it just wasn’t a major priority.”Elliptic co-founder James Smith at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph

                              <span>Binance co-founder and former CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao took the stage at Token2049 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), where he told the audience that his investment in social media platform X was aimed at protecting freedom of speech.
The former Binance executive joined a fireside panel with macroeconomic analyst Raoul Pal to discuss the rationale behind his 2022 investment in X and artificial intelligence. Zhao said:
&quot;I think freedom of money is important, but to have freedom of money, you have to have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is kind of the bottom line. If you don&#x27;t have that, nothing — no other freedom — works.&quot;  
&quot;So, when we invested in Twitter back then, it was based on that philosophy,&quot; Zhao continued.

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&amp;P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…</span>

The company also set more favorable chances of approval for other altcoin ETFs, including proposed funds holding XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in an X post. 
The estimates reflect an improved outlook from Bloomberg analysts. In a February analysis, Bloomberg pegged the odds of a Solana (SOL) ETF approval at only 70%. They ascribed a 65% and 75% chance of approval to funds holding XRP and DOGE, respectively.

In an April 30 filing in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), lawyers for Coinbase argued that a First Circuit Court of Appeals decision set a “dangerous precedent” for crypto users, potentially allowing the government to “trace users’ every crypto transaction in the past and monitor every crypto transaction in the future.” The appeal to the Supreme Court stemmed from petitioner James Harper, a Coinbase user, who took legal action against the IRS after the crypto exchange was forced to turn over transaction data to the government using a sweeping “John Doe…</span>

Stablecoins’ cumulative market cap currently stands at roughly $230 billion, but “[e]volving market dynamics [have] the potential to accelerate stablecoins’ trajectory to reach ~$2tn in market cap by 2028,” the Treasury said in the April 30 report. 
A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar. According to the report, such tokens are already “ubiquitously utilized as ‘cash on-chain,’ effectively serving as a new payment mechanism.”

Bitcoin’s price increased by sixfold each time its age increased by 40%.

If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could rally to $351,046 in 2025.

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

                              <span>Tether plans to launch a stablecoin product in the United States as soon as this year, the stablecoin issuer’s CEO, Paul Ardoino, said in an April 30 CNBC interview. 
Tether’s flagship stablecoin, USDT (USDT), is already the US dollar’s top “exporter,” Ardoino told CNBC. It has a market capitalization of nearly $150 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 
Now, Tether is preparing to expand into the US market “by the end of this year or early next year, at the fastest,” Ardoino said, adding that the timing depends on US lawmakers’ progress on stablecoin legislation. 
The stablecoin issuer is working to woo US regulators by proactively collaborating with law enforcement and highlighting USDT’s benefits for the US economy.

For venture capital, it was business as usual, with investors continuing to pour money into promising startups across layer-1 blockchains, infrastructure, real-world asset tokenization (RWA), and Web3 social media.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.
Despite the dismal price action, dismissing Ethereum as a relic may be premature. The network continues to evolve, and th…</span>

                              <span>Blockchain payments firm Ripple has reportedly bid up to $5 billion in an effort to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle, but the offer was rejected.
According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally.

US GDP shrank -0.3% in Q1, far below +0.3% forecasts, sparking recession fears.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023.

                              <span>Key points: 

US GDP shrank in Q1, raising recession alarms while also prompting calls for Fed rate cuts.

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support. 

Today’s crypto derisking is likely transitory; market fundamentals remain strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&amp;P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…</span>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it.

The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…</span>

                              <span>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX has filed lawsuits against the non-fungible token marketplace NFT Stars and the blockchain gaming firm Kurosemi, which operates as Delysium, accusing them of withholding tokens they owed.
The lawsuits, both filed in the Delaware bankruptcy court, alleged that NFT Stars and Delysium failed to deliver all the tokens paid for by FTX despite repeated attempts to resolve the matter.
FTX claimed in an April 28 statement that it made “numerous unanswered attempts” to engage with both firms, and it would be “contacting numerous other token and coin issuers regarding FTX assets and will be filing additional suits against non-responsive parties.”

The DLT shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), the firm said in its April 29 Form N-1A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The money market fund holds over $150 million worth of assets, invested almost entirely in US Treasury bills and cash.
BlackRock said that the shares “are expected to be purchased and held through BNY, which intends to use blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.”

Austin federal court judge Robert Pitman said in an April 28 judgment that OFAC’s sanctions on Tornado Cash were unlawful and that the agency was “permanently enjoined from enforcing” sanctions.
Tornado Cash users led by Joseph Van Loon had sued the Treasury, arguing that OFAC’s addition of the platform’s smart contract addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list was “not in accordance with law.” 
OFAC had sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, accusing the protocol of helping launder crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking collective, the Lazarus Group.

Richard Byworth says Michael Saylor’s Strategy could ramp up its Bitcoin buys by acquiring cash-rich companies and converting their cash into Bitcoin.

He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline.

Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy’s mNAV, benefiting shareholders.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says.
“Saylor’s strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast.

There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals.
The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they’ll be told to “use it or lose it.”

In an April 29 X post, tech commentator Jacob Canfield shared a scam letter sent to his home via post that appeared to be from Ledger claiming he needed to immediately perform a “critical security update” on his device. 
The letter, which uses Ledger’s logo, business address, and a reference number to feign legitimacy, asks to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s private recovery phrase under the guise of validating the device.
The letter threatens that “failure to complete this mandatory validation process may result in restricted access to your wallet and funds.”

                              <span>Key points:

Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.

If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.

Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening. 
According to a US Labor Department JOLTS report released on April 29, job openings in March approached their lowest levels in four years. US employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, below the…</span>

                              <span>Bettors on prediction platforms Polymarket and Kalshi are flipping bearish on the US economy. As of April 29, both platforms are predicting that the US will log an economic contraction during the first quarter of 2025 in an upcoming economic data release. 
The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession.
The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours. 
Meanwhile, Polymarket bettors are setting the odds of a US economic contraction in Q1 at around 70%. On April 28, they still had …</span>

                              <span>Key Takeaways:

Fidelity Digital Assets says Bitcoin is undervalued and the firm holds an optimistic mid-term outlook.

The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. 

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” 
As proof,  the firm cited the ‘Bitcoin Yardstick’ metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network. 
In Q1 2025, the metric stayed between -1 and 3 standard deviations, cooling from its Q4 2024 overheated levels. The number of days above 2-standard deviations dropped from 22 to 15, …</span>

                              <span>The Bank of Italy identified Bitcoin and other digital assets as emerging risk factors in a recent report, citing concerns for both investors and the financial system.
In its April 2025 Financial Stability Report, the Bank of Italy flags crypto volatility and rising integration with the broader economy, singling out stablecoins and non-financial firms’ crypto exposure as key concerns.
&quot;The strong growth of Bitcoin and of other crypto-assets with high price volatility means risks not only for investors but also potentially for financial stability, given the growing interconnections between the digital asset ecosystem, the traditional financial sector and the real economy,” the report notes.

                              <span>A court in India has ordered the encrypted email service Proton Mail blocked in the country for refusing to share information with authorities.
In an April 29 hearing of the High Court of Karnataka, Justice M Nagaprasanna ordered the government to “block forthwith” domain names associated with Proton Mail, citing authority under the country’s Information Technology Act of 2008. The order stemmed from a complaint filed in January by a New Delhi-based design firm, alleging that some of its employees received offensive emails through the service.  
It’s unclear whether the ban will take effect or face other possible challenges in court. The Proton team reported in March 2024 that Indian authorities had similarly proposed ordering the service blocked in response to alleged “hoax bomb threats,”…</span>

The US regulator has delayed its deadline for ruling on the proposed ETF listings until June, according to two filings reviewed by Cointelegraph. 
The filings were responses to March requests from US exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX Exchange to list Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and Franklin Templeton’s XRP (XRP) ETF, respectively. 
They came on the same day that Nasdaq, another US exchange, asked for permission to list a 21Shares Dogecoin ETF.

                              <span>Key takeaways:

Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals.

In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.

Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors’ inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.

                              <span>Key Takeaways: 

Fidelity Digital Assets’ report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum&#x27;s layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.
The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin’s favor.

                              <span>The United States exchange Nasdaq has asked regulators for permission to list a 21Shares exchange-traded fund (ETF) holding the popular memcoin Dogecoin, regulatory filings show. 
The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF, shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Polkadot (DOT). 
Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund. The request amounts to a regulatory review process that could determine whether Dogecoin becomes accessible to a broader range of investors through an ETF structure.

In an April 29 notice, the UK government announced draft rules for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), that would bring “crypto exchanges, dealers and agents” in line with regulations, as many residents were “exposed to risky firms and scams.” It cited discussions with US government officials, including a proposed US-UK cross-border sandbox from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Hester Peirce.

AI has been a dominant narrative since 2024, but users and companies still cannot completely trust it. Whether it’s finances, personal data or healthcare decisions, hesitation around AI’s reliability and integrity remains high.
This growing AI trust deficit is now one of the most significant barriers to widespread adoption. Decentralized, privacy-preserving technologies are quickly being recognized as viable solutions that offer verifiability, transparency and stronger data protection without compromising AI’s growth.

Bitcoin’s most recently-moved supply segment is increasing as higher prices see an influx of “speculative capital.”

“Hot supply” has doubled in just five weeks versus local lows in March.

Active address numbers have yet to mimic a classic bull market comeback.

Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders (STHs) are back in the game as a “speculative capital” enters the market.
In an X thread on April 29, onchain analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”

Bitrace defines high-risk blockchain addresses as those used by illegal entities to receive, transfer or store stablecoins.
Crypto compliance firms typically score crypto wallet addresses based on their likelihood of involvement in illicit activities. The higher the risk, the higher the likelihood of foul play, and the less likely compliant crypto businesses are to accept the assets.
Per the report, the amount accounted for roughly 5.14% of all stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. This is down 0.8% from 5.94% the previous year, but significantly higher than the 2.8% reported in 2022 and 1.63% in 2021.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.

                              <span>The United States’ rejection of a central bank digital currency has not halted the progress of CBDCs globally, but their success has been questionable so far, according to a former Binance executive.
Global CBDC projects have not failed, but they have also not become what they were anticipated to be, according to Olga Goncharova, CEO at the consulting firm Rizz Go and former director of government relations in the Commonwealth of Independent States at Binance.
“CBDCs were conceived as a technological breakthrough, but so far they look like expensive imitations of existing traditional fiat currencies that citizens and businesses already use through online banking and payment apps,” Goncharova told Cointelegraph at the Blockchain Forum in Moscow.

Trump’s trade war with the entire world has had the largest short-term impact on crypto markets, as crypto prices have wavered amid macroeconomic worry and uncertainty. Higher prices on electronics mean Bitcoin (BTC) miners are finding it harder to break even, and de-dollarization concerns abound. 
Still, crypto markets have shown some resilience and cause for optimism in the administration’s crypto-friendly policies. A number of pro-crypto leaders have been appointed to key government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Tra…</span>
