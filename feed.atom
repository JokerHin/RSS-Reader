        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creating generic structures in Rust can initially seem challenging, especially when it comes to default types. In this article, we will explore how to create a generic structure with a default type, allowing users to omit the generic parameter when defining instances. We’ll investigate why the Rust compiler requires explicit type annotations in certain situations and provide a step-by-step solution to this common problem.
Why Does Rust Require Explicit Type Annotation?
Rust is a statically typed language, which means types are known at compile time. When you define a generic structure, the compiler often needs to understand what specific type to use for the generics. In your code example, you're trying to instantiate C without specifying its type, which results in the following error:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever played with dominoes, you know that the order of the numbers doesn’t matter—[1,2] is the same as [2,1]. That's the central idea behind this popular LeetCode problem:
💡 Given a list of dominoes, return how many pairs of dominoes are equivalent. Two dominoes [a, b] and [c, d] are equivalent if:
(a == c and b == d) or
(a == d and b == c)
Let's dive into the most optimal way to solve this!
Instead of comparing every pair (which would take O(n²) time), we can:
Normalize each domino: [a, b] becomes [min(a, b), max(a, b)]

Use a hash map to count how many times each normalized domino appears.
Every time we see a duplicate, we count how many previous identical dominoes we've seen.
Add that count to the result (because every new domino can pair with all previous identical ones).

This guide breaks down actionable strategies to optimize indexing, querying, and shard management for improved performance and cluster health.
Index: A logical namespace that maps to one or more physical shards.
Shard: A basic unit of storage and search in OpenSearch. Each shard is a Lucene index.
Performance is tightly tied to how indices and shards are structured, distributed, and queried.
Too many shards create overhead; too few limit concurrency. Aim for ideal shard sizes between 10–50 GB.
Avoid the default 5 shards unless justified.

After a major setback wiped our codebase, we rebuilt Tavrn's 1-to-1 DM system from scratch — in just 3 days. This post breaks down how we did it, what’s new, and why it’s already better than before.
After losing our original codebase, we had two choices:

Start over slowly and mourn the loss...

Or hit the ground running and build something better.
We chose the second one.
It only took 3 days — but our 1-to-1 messaging system is back.

Fully rebuilt from the ground up. Clean. Fast. Future-proof.

And, honestly? It’s better than what we had before.
We redesigned how messages move, how conversations flow, and how it all scales.

What used to feel basic now feels tight — like something you’ll actually want to use every day.
Here’s a little peek at what’s already working in our new DM system:
🔒 Fast messaging with improved delivery speeds

🌙 Sleeker UI built with clarity and vibe in mind

🗂️ Better message rendering
💬 Typing indicators and presence detection, redone the right way

⚡️ A system that can grow without getting messy



And we’re just getting started.
Now that DMs are locked in, we’re moving on to polish other core features — including group chats, profiles, and real-time updates.
Every step is built with community, performance, and personality in mind.

No bloat. No noise. Just smooth, satisfying conversation.
Setbacks happen. But we’re proud of how we responded:

By building. By improving. By actually shipping something better.
If you’ve been waiting on Tavrn — thank you.

The foundation is back. And the future’s right behind it.

We'd start with good intentions, but two hours later, no real decisions have been made.

We needed structure, not just good intentions.
So, we started implementing detailed agendas for every meeting.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who jumped from Windows to Linux, I've found that your choice of operating system can definitely impact your coding life - but it's not make-or-break. Linux gives me a better command line, simpler software installation, and runs lighter on my hardware. I especially love how it matches most production servers, making deployment way less headache-inducing.
That said, Windows isn't the villain some developers make it out to be. It plays nicer with commercial software, gaming tools, and corporate systems. Windows users now have a solid option with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), letting you run Linux tools right inside Windows - giving you the best of both worlds without the commitment of switching entirely.
Ultimately, great developers build amazing stuff on all systems. Your OS is just one piece of your toolkit, not the defining factor of your skills. My switch to Linux boosted my workflow for web and backend projects, but I know plenty of rockstar devs crushing it on Windows and Mac. 
What's your setup? Has switching operating systems ever changed your coding game? Share your story!

  The Coffee Machine Analogy


Imagine assembling a high-tech coffee machine:
Water Tank → Your data (documents, APIs, databases).
Filter → The retriever (fetches relevant chunks).
Boiler → The LLM (generates answers).
Cup → Your polished response.
LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is the instruction manual that snaps these pieces together seamlessly. No duct tape or spaghetti code—just clean, modular pipelines.
LCEL lets you build production-ready RAG systems with:
Retriever → Searches your vector DB (like a librarian).
Prompt Template → Formats the question + context for the LLM.
LLM → Generates the answer (e.g., GPT-4, Claude).
Output Parser → Cleans up responses (e.g., extracts text, JSON).

The issue you're experiencing occurs when trying to compare an instance of the ExitStatus class from Spring Batch using the ==</code operator.
Understanding the Comparison in Kotlin
Kotlin has a distinct approach to equality compared to Java. In Kotlin, the == operator is actually syntactic sugar for the equals() method. Thus, when you write if (jobExecution.exitStatus == ExitStatus.COMPLETED), Kotlin attempts to call equals() on the jobExecution.exitStatus.  However, if Kotlin does not recognize ExitStatus as having a valid equals method that matches the expected types, you will receive the compilation error: No method 'equals(Any?): Boolean' av…]]></summary>

Best Practices

Summary
In Linux, we usually use chmod and chown to manage file permissions. That works well when you just need to give access to one user and one group. But what if you need to give access to multiple users or different groups on the same file?
That's where ACLs (Access Control Lists) come in. They allow you to control file access in a much more detailed way.
Standard permissions only allow:
One owner (user)
One group
Let’s say you want to:
Give read-only access to one user
Allow full access to another user
And block a group from accessing the file
You can’t do this wi…]]></summary>

If you've found yourself wondering why the AWS CLI ignores --include options when you run a complex command through a Bash script, you're not alone. Many users experience unexpected behavior when executing AWS S3 commands, especially when utilizing recursive downloads along with --exclude and --include flags. Understanding how these flags work together in the context of Bash scripts can be crucial for achieving the desired results without unnecessary downloads.
Understanding the Issue
The primary cause of the problem you're encountering is how the Bash script is interpreting the command instructions. When we involve special characters, spacing, and quotes in Bash, it’s easy for commands to be parsed incorrectly compared to when they’re executed directly in the terminal.

Qwen 3, the latest iteration of Alibaba Cloud's Qwen series, is a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) designed for advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, code completion, and multi-modal reasoning. Its hardware requirements depend on the specific use case (training vs. inference), model size (e.g., parameter count), and deployment environment (cloud vs. on-premise). This report outlines the necessary hardware specifications for various scenarios.
  Parameter Count: Qwen 3 is expected to scale from 7 billion (7B) to 100+ billion (100B+) parameters, with potential variants like Qwen 3-7B, Qwen 3-72B, and Qwen 3-100B. Larger models require more memory and computational power.

The most subtle bugs aren't in the code you write - they're in the code you approve without enough context.
This is a short story about a seemingly harmless line in a PR that I reviewed - and how it taught me to slow down, even with small changes.
The line of code below,
if(!user.isVerified) return;

intention behind this was good not to allow unverified users to proceed into the app.
But this return statement wasn't part of larger flow. It was inside a route guard - and it exited silently, without a redirect, message or error.
User who signed up with Google or Github (OAuth) were marked isVerified=false
This line caused the app to fail to load the protected dashboard, but displayed no error
The app just failed silently with blank screen to user.
A fallback route with clear message was added and tested both social and email/password flows going forward.
if(!user.isVerified) {
    this.route.navigate(['/verify-email']);
    return;

Когда количество пользователей растет экспоненциально, объем данных увеличивается, а требования к функциональности усложняются? Именно здесь на первый план выходит масштабируемость — способность системы эффективно справляться с растущей нагрузкой.
PERN-стек (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) предоставляет мощный набор инструментов для создания современных веб-приложений. Но сам по себе стек не гарантирует масштабируемости. Ключ кроется в архитектуре — в том, как вы структурируете ваш код, проектируете базу данных и организуете взаимодействие компонентов.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the fast-paced world of software development, Quality Assurance (QA) Testers are the unsung heroes ensuring that what we build actually works — and works well. They test end to end to ensure the products meet its requirement and specification. They look for loopholes, and prevent bugs in production.
Here’s why QA is essential:
✅ Bug Prevention, Not Just Detection: QA testers help catch issues early, saving time and resources before bugs make it to production.
✅ Improved User Experience: They think like end users, helping to ensure a smooth, intuitive experience.
✅ Boosts Developer Efficiency: Engineers can focus on building, knowing QA has their back on quality.
✅ Confidence to Ship: With QA sign-off, teams can deploy with peace of mind.
✅ Maintains Brand Reputation: High-quality, reliable software keeps users happy and loyal.
A great QA Tester doesn’t just test — they collaborate, communicate, and elevate the whole team.
Let’s stop thinking of QA as the last step, and instead, an integral part of the process from Day One. 💡]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Com o crescimento das ferramentas de inteligência artificial (IA) como ChatGPT, Gemini e DeepSeek, muitos usuários buscam maneiras de otimizar suas interações para obter respostas mais precisas e relevantes. Uma estratégia eficaz é organizar as conversas por temas ou especialidades. Essa abordagem não apenas mantém o contexto claro, mas também reduz erros e mal-entendidos.
🎯 Por que Organizar as Conversas por Tema?
Manutenção do Contexto: Ao separar as conversas por tópicos específicos, a IA pode entender melhor o assunto em questão, proporcionando respostas mais alinhadas às suas necessidades.
Histórico Claro: Ter conversas distintas para cada tema facilita a revisão de informações anteriores, permitindo que você retome discussões passadas sem confusão.
Redução de Erros: Misturar assuntos em uma única conversa pode levar a respostas imprecisas. Ao manter tópicos separados, você minimiza esse risco.
🛠️ Dicas para Organizar Suas Conversas
Crie Títulos Específicos: Nomeie cada conversa com um título que reflita claramente o tema abordado, como “Dicas de UX/UI” ou “Aprendizado de Python”.
Utilize Etiquetas ou Pastas: Se a plataforma permitir, categorize suas conversas em pastas ou com etiquetas para facilitar o acesso futuro.
Inicie com um Contexto Claro: Ao começar uma nova conversa, forneça informações detalhadas sobre o que você espera da IA, incluindo objetivos e restrições.
📈 Benefícios a Longo Prazo
Adotar essa abordagem estruturada não apenas melhora a qualidade das respostas, mas também transforma a IA em uma ferramenta mais eficaz para aprendizado e trabalho. Com conversas bem organizadas, você economiza tempo, evita retrabalho e maximiza o potencial das ferramentas de IA.
Organizar suas interações com inteligências artificiais por temas ou especialidades é uma prática simples, mas poderosa. Ao implementar essa estratégia, você garante conversas mais produtivas, claras e eficientes, aproveitando ao máximo o que essas ferramentas têm a oferecer.]]></summary>

echo vs print: An Overview


Both echo and print are language constructs in PHP that are used to output data to the screen. While they may seem interchangeable, there are subtle differences:
Syntax and Efficiency: 
echo can accept multiple parameters, whereas print can only take one argument.
echo is slightly faster as it doesn’t return any value, allowing for better performance in large-scale applications.
Return Values: 
echo does not return any value.

In programming, passing parameters to functions is crucial for manipulating data effectively. Java, unlike some languages such as C#, does not support reference parameters in the same way. Instead, Java uses pass-by-value semantics, which means that when you pass a variable to a method, a copy of that variable is sent. However, there are ways to achieve similar functionality using mutable objects or wrapper classes. In this article, we'll explore how to simulate reference-like behavior in Java using simple examples and provide a clear understanding of handling output parameters in functions.

1 INTRODUÇÃO
Hoje em dia, com quase tudo conectado à internet, a segurança dos sistemas de software virou uma grande preocupação. Ataques e acessos indevidos podem acontecer a qualquer momento, e por isso é tão importante que os sistemas já sejam pensados para se proteger desde o começo.
Quando se fala em segurança, fala-se da proteção dos dados e do bom funcionamento do sistema em geral, mesmo diante de possíveis ameaças. Isso é ainda mais importante em áreas como os sistemas do governo, ecommerce ou qualquer serviço que lida com informações sensíveis e confidenciais. Ou seja, desenvolver sistemas usando técnicas seguras é algo essencial para garantir confiança e evitar prejuízos em todos os aspectos.

Understanding JSON Marshaling in Go
In Go, the encoding/json package is typically used to encode and decode JSON. In your example, b, _ := json.Marshal(output) marshals the output variable into a JSON byte slice b. The underscore _ is used to ignore any errors that may occur during marshaling. This is often a pattern when we are confident that there won't be an error or we want to handle it later.

If you’ve ever wanted to deploy a full-stack application without worrying about managing servers or scaling infrastructure, Google Cloud Run is a game-changer. In this post, we’ll walk through deploying a modern React frontend and Node.js backend using Cloud Run — Google Cloud’s fully managed container platform. Whether you're building a personal project or a production app, Cloud Run helps you go live quickly.
Architecture Overview
Here’s a simplified flow of how the app works:
Users access the frontend hosted on Cloud Run.
The frontend makes API requests to the backend, also hosted on Cloud Run.
The backend processes the requests and sends back responses (JSON data).
Cloud Run handles traffic, scaling, and security for both services.

Understanding the Problem

In any software project, every small change made to the codebase is recorded in Git history. This history is not just a log of what happened — it's a crucial tool for tracking changes, collaborating with others, managing releases, and automating development workflows.
It becomes hard to understand why a change was made
Generating changelogs becomes manual and time-consuming
CI/CD tools can’t effectively leverage the commit history
And in team environments, others struggle to follow your changes
This is where Conventional Commits come into play. It’s a simple but powerful convention that allows us to write commit messages in a structured, readable, and machine-parsable way — making life easier for both developers and tools.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently in enterprise development, I came across a requirement to adjust and optimize a scheduled email-sending task. While the logic itself was straightforward, the debugging experience was not.
Here's what made it tricky:
The development environment lacks a unified interface to manually trigger backend @Scheduled tasks from the frontend.
Debugging by modifying the cron expression means:


Restarting the entire project every time
Risking a flood of unintended emails






While test code can directly invoke methods, it's not always clean or convenient.
Let’s look at the scheduled task:
@Component
public class EmailScheduled {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 23 * * * ?")
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    }        
}

afterPropertiesSet to Trigger the Task


The idea is simple: leverage the InitializingBean interface. Spring will automatically call afterPropertiesSet() when initializing a bean. So we can invoke emailSend() there to simulate a scheduled run.
@Component
public class EmailScheduled implements InitializingBean {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 23 * * * ?")
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    } 

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        emailSend(); // Triggered once at startup
    }
}

No cron modification
No project restart just to adjust time
No actual scheduling triggered — just one-time manual invocation
Perfect for short-term debugging during development
This is not meant to be a long-term solution. Remember to remove or disable this hack before deploying to production. For a more robust setup, consider exposing your scheduled tasks through an admin/debug endpoint or using Spring Boot Actuator with proper security controls.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building applications with Dart and Flutter, you might come across the frustrating issue of losing data on a TextInput field when the keyboard is dismissed. This typically occurs because the state of the input field is not being managed correctly. By utilizing a TextEditingController, you can ensure that the value users type into the text field remains intact even after they click 'Ok' or use the back button to hide the keyboard.
Understanding TextEditingController
In Flutter, a TextEditingController is an object that can be used to control a text field. It helps in retrieving the current value of the text field, listening to changes, and manipulating it. If you don’t initialize a TextEditingController, the text field will not maintain its state after interactions.
Why the Value Disap…]]></summary>

A coroutine is a lightweight thread that can be suspended and resumed. It allows you to perform long-running tasks like network calls or database operations without blocking the main thread.

"Clean code isn’t some magic skill — it’s just a habit you build over time."
And guess what? You can totally build that habit.
Clean code means writing code that's clear, organized, and easy to work with. It makes your life (and your teammates’ lives) way easier. But let’s be honest — how many times have we said, “I’ll clean this up later”?
Here’s the truth:
There’s never a perfect time to refactor
Messy code turns into technical debt — and sooner or later, you’ll have to deal with it. It’s better to start clean than to fix bugs forever later.
Writing clean code isn’t as hard as it sounds. Actually, it can feel really natural once you get the hang of it. Think of it like building something with care — not just typing stuff out.

I built AutoSecure API Gateway, a robust API gateway solution for the automotive industry that implements API-first authorization principles. By leveraging Permit.io's NGINX integration, the project externalizes authorization logic from application code and enforces fine-grained access control at the gateway layer. This ensures consistent, centralized, and declarative policy enforcement across all APIs.
The project demonstrates real-world use cases, such as managing vehicle telemetry, fleet operations, and driver analytics, while supporting multiple roles like vehicle owners, service technicians, and fleet managers.

Java has a guideline: “Don’t use inheritance unless you have a good reason.” But Java doesn’t strictly limit inheritance — you can still use it freely. Go, however, is different: it only allows composition.
So why do modern languages promote composition? Actually, it’s not just new languages — even the veteran Java mentions in Item 16 of Effective Java: “Favor composition over inheritance.” Inheritance is a powerful way to reuse code, but it may not be the best method.
So it’s worth thinking this through carefully. Without diving into specific code, let's talk about the concepts. I believe we can explore this topic from the following perspectives:

⚠️ Decorators are a Stage-3 proposal in JavaScript. You can use them with TypeScript or Babel.
A decorator is a special function you can attach to:
A class
A class method
A class property
It looks like this:
@myDecorator
class MyClass {}

Or for methods:
class MyClass {
  @log

Think of a decorator as a function that wraps the original function, property, or class to change its behavior.

For the Permit.io Authorization Challenge, I built Zedd-KB—a secure, AI-powered internal knowledge base designed for organizations that demand robust, fine-grained authorization over both AI actions and sensitive data access. Zedd-KB demonstrates how externalized authorization with Permit.io can safeguard information and AI capabilities in real-world applications.
Zedd-KB is an internal knowledge base platform that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and advanced LLMs to answer user queries using only authorized, relevant content. It integrates Permit.io for dynamic, policy-driven access control, ensuring that every AI action and data access is checked against up-to-date security policies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across industries, promising unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. However, the success of AI initiatives is inextricably linked to the quality and readiness of the data that powers them. As the saying goes, "garbage in, garbage out" – this maxim is particularly relevant in AI implementation, where poor data quality leads directly to unreliable outputs, biased decisions, and failed projects.
This comprehensive guide explores data readiness assessment for AI implementation, providing a structured framework to evaluate if your organization's data is prepared to support successful AI initiatives.

-Thus is a submission for the Permit.io Authorization Challenge: Permission Redefined
What I Build
This project solves a very real-world need: teams need to collaborate, but not everyone should have the same powers. QuickCollab ensures users see and can act on only what they're authorized for — no more, no less.
Demo
https://permit-frontend-oafvwri0e-navankurusersessionmanagement.vercel.app/
Project Repo

Using Permit.io for Authorization
🔐 Used @permitio/sdk in a centralized permit.js file
🧠 Implemented checkPermission() and assignRole() functions in a custom service layer
🛠️ Integrated with Express backend via role-based API routes (/assign-role and /check-permission)
🔁 Roles (admin, manager, etc.) and resources (workspace:123) are dynamically registered and queried using the Permit.io cloud PDP
Permit.io helped me implement real RBAC and ABAC logic faster than building an in-house system — and with way more confidence.
Shoutout
Thanks to the Permit.io team for enabling builders like me with a tool that makes fine-grained access control actually practical. This was more than a submission — it was a step toward building better, safer, and more intentional apps.

So, it's Sunday, homeboy, and I usually escape debates and negative thoughts. But today, I was scouring dev.to and stumbled across a post boldly titled "Stop Using AWS."
It wasn't the first time I'd seen a call to drop Amazon Web Services for something "simpler", but this one hit a nerve, not because it was provocative, but because it misrepresents why AWS exists and what problems it solves. So, I decided to sit back, relax, and explain why you should absolutely keep using AWS, especially if you're serious about software, scalability, and sustainability.
The post opens with a classic anecdote: a developer builds an MVP with all the AWS bells and whistles, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, DynamoDB, and no one uses it. The conclusion? AWS was overkill.

Operating System (you install)
Full control over the environment
You manage OS, applications, runtime, data
Provider manages hardware, virtualization, networking
Microsoft Azure VMs, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine
💡 Real-life example:
raw apartment (VM). You bring in furniture (OS/apps), arrange it (configs), and clean it (security/patches).
Runtime environment
Pre-installed OS and libraries
Scaling and patching handled
Focus on code and deployment
You manage code and data
Provider manages infrastructure, OS, middleware, scaling
Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service, Vercel (Next.js Hosting)
💡 Real-life example:
food truck kitchen. It's stocked and ready. You bring your recipe (code), cook, and serve. No cleaning or buying equipment.
Fully functional software
No installation or maintenance
Access via browser or app
Provider manages everything
You just use it
Gmail, Google Docs, Salesforce, ChatGPT, Figma

In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Array, Hash Table, Counting
Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a == c and b == d), or (a == d and b == c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.
Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].
Example 1:
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Constraints:
1 <= dominoes.length <= 4 * 104
dominoes[i].length == 2
1 <= dominoes[i][j] <= 9
Hint:
For each domino j, find the number of dominoes you've already seen (dominoes i with i < j) that are equivalent.

Astro has a static-first architecture and I was going to use it without its on-demand SSR feature. So just for a note, this means I couldn't use Astro session that could've been handy for operating states handled by server. Meanwhile, I also used Vue.js alongside Astro with its integration portability (sorry if it looks like I am doing an experiment here, yes I'm still learning).

In Python programming, multithreading is a commonly used means of concurrent programming, which can effectively improve the execution efficiency of the program, especially when dealing with I/O-intensive tasks. Python makes multithreading programming relatively easy with the help of the threading module. This article will delve into the basic knowledge of the threading module and demonstrate the application of multithreading through examples.
Before starting, let's first understand some basic concepts of multithreading programming:

The Alibaba recently team has released the Qwen 3 Series, including two standout models: the 235B parameter MoE model (with 22B active parameters) and a lightweight 30B version (3B active). 
As per official docs, the Qwen3-235B-A22B model take on giants like DeepSeek R1, Grok-3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro—and it is doing it with fewer active parameters, faster inference, and open-source accessibility.
On the other hand, on a lighter note the Qwen3-30B-A3B outcompetes the previous QwQ-32B with 10 times of activated parameters, and a small model like Qwen3-4B can rival the performance of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct.

Best part, takes fraction of cost per million input and output token, compared to SOTA models.

Impressive, isn’t?

They are easy to search and navigate, but getting your data into the graph database in the right format can be challenging.

So it's important to define a good schema, or ontology, that describes the entities and relationships you want to extract from your data.
With unstructured text, you can use an LLM to extract entities and relationships, and then generate a Cypher query using the model (guide).

Unlike Docker, Podman is daemonless, running containers directly under the user's control, which brings unique benefits in security and flexibility.
Daemonless Operation

Podman does not require a central background service. Each container runs as a child process of the user, reducing resource overhead and improving security by eliminating a single point of failure.
Rootless Containers

Podman supports running containers without root privileges. This greatly reduces the risk of privilege escalation and is ideal for multi-user systems or environments with strict security requirements.

I recently published a detailed, opinionated guide:
This article walks through everything we’ve learned running hardened, production-grade clusters in the wild — including practices you won’t always find in the docs.
🛠️ What’s inside?
🔁 GitOps-first workflows with ArgoCD (App of Apps)
🔐 Secrets via Vault, no root containers, SSO-only access
📊 Prometheus, Grafana, and meaningful alerts
☠️ Chaos testing and real disaster recovery drills
💻 Backstage + Dev tooling to make platforms dev-friendly
🚨 Automated upgrades, cert rotation, version hygiene
🧠 Whether you're running EKS, GKE, or bare-metal clusters — this is a blueprint you can adapt and evolve.
👇 I'd love to hear from you:
What's one trick you’ve learned the hard way that you wish others knew?
Let's learn from each other — because great clusters aren't born, they’re built.

Paint gibi uygulamalarda resmi kendi başına çizer. Kurulumu ve kullanımı oldukça basittir. Aşağıdaki adımları takip ederek dakikalar içinde kullanmaya başlayabilirsin.
AutoDrawer'ı kullanabilmek için önce GitHub üzerindeki proje sayfasına gidip dosyaları indirmen gerekiyor.
AutoDrawer GitHub Sayfası
Sağ üstten Code butonuna tıkla
Açılan menüden Download ZIP seçeneğini seç
ZIP dosyasını bilgisayarına indir
İndirdiğin .zip dosyasına sağ tıklayarak çıkart.
“Buraya çıkart” veya “Tümünü ayıkla” gibi bir seçeneği seç
Çıkardığın klasörün içinde şu yola sırayla gir:




autodrawer-master\AutoDrawer\bin\Debug\

Bu klasörün içinde AutoDrawer.exe adında bir dosya göreceksin.
Bu dosyaya çift tıkla, program başlar. Kurulum gerekmez.
AutoDrawer, fareyi kullanarak çizim yaptığı için bir çizim programı açık olmalıdır. En basiti, Windows’un içindeki Paint programıdır.
Başlat menüsünden “Paint” yazıp açabilirsin
Boş bir sayfa açık şekilde durmalıdır
AutoDrawer çalıştığında sana bir görsel dosyası seçtirir.
Mümkünse siyah-beyaz ve sade bir resim kullan
JPG veya PNG formatı uygundur
Görsel ne kadar sade olursa çizim o kadar hızlı ve düzgün olur
AutoDrawer, fareyle çizim yapacağı alanı anlaması için senden bölge seçmeni ister.
Paint açıkken, çizeceği alanı farenin sol tuşuyla sürükleyerek seç
Bu alan Paint penceresinin içi olmalıdır
Programda Start veya Başlat butonuna tıkla
Fare otomatik hareket etmeye ve resmi çizmeye başlar
Bu sırada fareye ve bilgisayara müdahale etme
Çizim sırasında fareye dokunma, yoksa işlem bozulur
Bilgisayarda başka işlem yapma, pencere değiştirme
Görselin detayına göre çizim birkaç saniye ya da dakika sürebilir
En iyi sonuçlar için siyah-beyaz ve küçük görseller tercih edilir]]></summary>

File permissions are a cornerstone of Linux security, ensuring that only the right people can access or modify critical files. Whether you're a budding sysadmin or a curious developer, understanding how Linux handles file access is crucial to maintaining control and security.
Let’s break it down 👇
Linux file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Each file or directory is governed by three levels of access:
Owner (User) – The creator of the file.
Group – Users who belong to the assigned group.
Others – Everyone else.
Permissions are represented in two ways:
Read (r or 4) – View file contents.
Write (w or 2) – Modify file contents.

In this article, we’ll dive into three of the most exciting additions to Cypress:
cy.session() — for smarter state caching
cy.press() — for realistic keyboard navigation
cy.stop() — for precise control of test execution
Whether you're scaling tests across CI, validating accessibility flows or debugging a tricky edge case, these new commands will upgrade your test suite.
cy.session(): cache once, reuse everywhere

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we will dive into part 6 in the shell scripting series. Today we will look at how you can use a for loop to iterate through all files in a directory and the function of file comparison.
Shell scripting is essential in production environments for automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency, and minimising human error. It enables engineers to streamline deployments, manage system configurations, monitor processes, and orchestrate complex workflows with precision. In a high-availability environment, shell scripts act as reliable, lightweight tools that reduce manual intervention and improve operational efficiency.


Create the script using VIM.



Write the script in VIM and save the file.






Apply the necessary permissions to the script so it can be executed.



If we do a ls –ltrh we see that the script has been created. It has a green colour to it – indicating that it is now executable.



Execute the script using ./



The output of the script, after it has been executed.





  
  
  Stay tuned, part 7 in the series coming tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
I’m a designer/developer who’s always hunting for the perfect color palette, and I got tired of manually picking colors from images. So, I built a free web tool that lets you upload any image (or use a sample), and it instantly gives you a palette of the most important colors – in HEX, RGB, HSL, etc.
You can choose between different extraction methods (Vibrant, Material Design, Median Cut, K-Means) depending on what kind of palette you want. It works right in your browser, and nothing gets uploaded to a server.
Try it here: https://colorsfromimage.xyz/
Would love to hear what you think!
Is it useful for your workflow?
Any features you wish it had?
Found any bugs or weird results?
I’m open to all feedback, and if you make something cool with it, please share! Thanks for checking it out :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wrestled with a RAG pipeline and thought, “Why is this so damn hard?” We’ve been there—tearing our hair out over complexity and slow performance. So, I built Dcup, an open-source, self-hostable RAG-as-a-Service platform that actually works Very good.
It’s a tool to hook your app up to user data with zero bullshit. Here’s the rundown:
Tech Stack: Next.js, BullMQ for job queues, OpenAI for embeddings, and Qdrant for vector storage. It’s lean, mean, and scales like a dream.


Killer Features: AI-driven retrieval and hybrid search that cuts through the noise. Plus, optional re-ranking if you’re a precision freak.
Learn more



At its core, Dcup is your bridge to smarter data handling. It takes the complexity out of RAG pipelines by automating the heavy lifting. Here’s how it works in plain English:
Data Ingestion: Hook up your data sources—think Google Drive, AWS, or wherever your files live—and Dcup keeps it all synced and current.
Data Processing: Your raw data gets chopped into bite-sized chunks and turned into embeddings using OpenAI. (More on embeddings later—they’re cool!)
Storage & Indexing: Those embeddings land in Qdrant, a lightning-fast vector database that makes searching a breeze.
Advanced Retrieval: Need answers fast? Features like re-ranking and hybrid search dig up the most relevant info in seconds.
Think of Dcup as your personal AI assistant that organizes, understands, and retrieves your data like a pro.
Big files used to choke us. Performance would tank, and we’d be staring at spinning wheels. Then we got smart—batching and parallel processing turned it around. Now, Dcup eats large datasets for breakfast.
This isn’t some corporate ad. It’s a project by dev not shitty vibe coding or whatever the kids call it these days.
Star the repo if it vibes with you: Dcup on GitHub.  
Wanna contribute? Hit me up! Let’s make RAG pipelines suck less together.]]></summary>

A-Creational Patterns
Deal with object creation mechanism to decouple the client code from concrete classes.
Factory Pattern: Centralizes object creation logic and returns different subclasses based on input
Singleton Pattern: Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to it.
Builder Pattern: Constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing optional configuration.
B - Structural Patterns
Help compose classes and objects into larger structures.
Adapter Pattern: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by translating one interface into another.
Decorator Pattern: Adds new behavior to objects dynamically without altering their original structure.
Proxy Pattern: Acts as a placeholder for accessing another object.
C - Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication and interaction between objects.
Strategy Pattern: Allows selecting an algorithm or behavior from a family of interchangeable strategies at runtime.
Observer Pattern: Enables a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
Command Pattern: An object encapsulates all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you're building a web app on your local machine, sometimes you need to share it with someone online — maybe a teammate, client, or even for testing on your mobile device. But localhost only works on your computer.
That’s where tunneling tools come in! They create a secure public URL that maps to your local server. Below are three popular options:
Website: https://ngrok.com
How it works: You run a command like
ngrok http 3000

and ngrok gives you a public HTTPS link that forwards traffic to your localhost:3000.
Pros:
Very fast and reliable
Works well with webhooks (e.g., Stripe, GitHub)
Dashboard to inspect requests
Cons:
Free tier has time and region limits
Requires an account after initial use
GitHub: https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel
How it works:
npm i -g localtunnel

Then run
lt --port 3000

Pros:
Super simple and open source
No signup required
Cons:
Can be slower or less reliable than others
Fewer features, no UI
Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/
How it works:
cloudflared CLI and connect your app through Cloudflare.
Pros:
Very secure
Great if you're already using Cloudflare DNS
Free with more generous limits than ngrok
Cons:
Slightly more setup steps
Best for advanced users or teams
🧠 Final Thoughts
Just pick the one that fits your workflow and you're good to go!

  Introduction


n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that can be used to create AI agents for various tasks. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of building an AI agent using n8n, covering everything from setup to deployment.
Basic understanding of n8n
Access to an n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
API keys for any AI services you plan to integrate (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
Start by creating a new workflow in n8n. You'll need to add nodes for:
Trigger (e.g., HTTP request, schedule)
AI service integration
Data processing
Output (e.g., email, webhook)
Connect your workflow to AI APIs like OpenAI or Hugging Face. Use n8n's HTTP Request node or dedicated nodes if available.
Test your workflow thoroughly before deploying. Monitor performance and adjust as needed.
With n8n, building AI agents becomes accessible even for non-developers. The possibilities are endless!]]></summary>

Each week Mohammad S. Anwar sends out The Weekly Challenge, a chance for all of us to come up with solutions to two weekly tasks. It's a great way for us all to practice some coding.
Challenge, My solutions
You are given a list of words containing alphabetic characters only.
Write a script to return the count of words either starting with a vowel or ending with a vowel.
So vowels in English are a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y. It seems clear from the second example that even though weekly ends with a vowel, the task assumes that it is just the five letters.
This task is a one liner, and simply counts the words that starts with a vowel letter or ends with one.
def word_count(words: list[str]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for word in words if re.search('^[aeiou]', word) or re.search('[aeiou]$', word))

$ ./ch-1.py unicode xml raku perl
2

$ ./ch-1.py the weekly challenge
2

$ ./ch-1.py perl python postgres
0

You are given two arrays of integers.
Write a script to return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If none found return -1.
For the command line input, I take two strings and separate them on non-digit characters.
My solution takes the two lists and converts them to sets and uses the intersection method & to get values that appears in both lists.
If there is one or more values found it returns the minimum value. If none is found, it will return -1.
def minimum_common(list1: list[int], list2: list[int]) -> int:
    intersection = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return min(intersection) if intersection else -1

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3, 4" "3, 4, 5, 6"
3

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3" "2, 4"
2

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3, 4" "5, 6, 7, 8"
-1]]></summary>

So we have an API running in production — does that mean it’s truly production-grade?
More often than not, the answer is no.
We write the code, test it locally (usually alone, on one machine, with one user), and proudly tell the business, "Hey, it’s ready!"

Maybe there’s even a QA environment where someone from product gives it a quick click-through and confirms, "Looks good to me!"
And then... reality checks in.
You get a call on the weekend:

“Users can’t log in.”

Or worse:

“A customer placed an order, and it’s gone.”
Now you're scrambling, thinking:

“I wish I’d added logs there.”

“Why didn’t we catch this earlier?”

“How are we supposed to debug this in production?”

This project is a lightweight Internal Tools Access Panel — a dashboard interface that securely routes employees to internal tools like HRMS, Sales CRM, or CI/CD pipelines, based on their role within the organization.
The problem it solves is twofold:
Over-permissioned access: Without RBAC, internal systems often expose all tools to every employee.
Complex onboarding: Managing access manually per user or embedding authorization logic deep in every tool becomes hard to maintain.
With this panel, companies can:
✅ Centralize internal tool access
✅ Restrict access to only the tools users need
✅ Offload role/policy management to Permit.io

Assume you want to create an account in SBI bank. So you fill that form and your account is created.
Now you are the person who created that form. Which attribute or field you will create which is necessary to create an account. Lets say:-
Name


DOB


Aadhaar card no.


PAN Card no.



class BankForm:
__init__(userName,userDOB,userAdhaarNo,userPAN):
Rohan=BankForm("Rohan","12-09-2025","xxxx8907","KB1234")
you will find an error. why?
Because the class doesn't know about the form. It mean that you are creating the form, but for whom. If you are thinking for SBI. Let me tell you they doesn't know. so how we are going to tell them. 
By using 'self'.
class BankForm:
__init__(self,Name,DOB,AdhaarNo,PAN):
'self' it just a way to tell SBI I have a form for you.
Now you have heard some word like Instance, __init__ and object.
Instance:- It is just like Rohan want form for himself.So you have to fill BankForm as in Instance.
__init__:- Initialisation of object. Like you want to create form and decide field which is needed for the form. Like Name, DOB, AdhaarNo., PANNo..

When we first created Fetch PHP, our goal was simple: to bring the elegance and simplicity of JavaScript's fetch API to the PHP ecosystem. Frontend developers have long enjoyed the intuitive nature of fetch() for making HTTP requests, and we wanted backend developers to have the same experience.

Comic book collectors face a common challenge: getting the best value for their money. While the cover price is straightforward, the actual value can vary significantly when you consider the number of pages in each volume. A $20 comic might contain 100 pages, while another at the same price point offers 400 pages. To solve this practical problem, we'll develop a TypeScript program that calculates and compares the price per page, helping collectors make data-driven purchasing decisions. The complete source code for this project is available on GitHub.
Using this approach, I bought four 400-plus-page comics for $85 total, including shipping costs. The implementation focuses on the Wildberries e-commerce platform, which serves Eastern European markets. The code structure is modular,…]]></summary>

When I launched my idea — a simple SaaS for status pages — someone commented:
“You're building the same thing that already exists. Where’s the uniqueness?”
And honestly? That’s exactly why I decided to build it.
The market already exists. Paying customers already exist.
Can I sell it? Can I make money from it?
That’s what really matters.
There was a time when you could “build → launch → get traffic.”
Now, product-first is a trap.
Instead:
Before writing a single line of code, I:
Built a landing page explaining what the idea is, and who it's for
Defined pricing (based on competitors and positioning)
Started driving traffic
Measured how many leads I could get
Learned if I could "sell" the idea, even without a working product
That’s the real funnel: find traffic → qualify leads → convert → check economics.
Not “does the idea have demand?”
I’m testing:
Can I attract and convert leads in this market?
Can I acquire users profitably?
Can I turn this into a sustainable business?
That’s the difference between a side project and an actual SaaS business.
In a big enough market, there's room for dozens of products.
Distribution > innovation
Marketing > features
If you can build a profitable funnel — traffic, conversions, retention — you win.
That’s what I’m focused on. The product is secondary — for now.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[PHP has evolved significantly over the years, transforming from a loosely-typed scripting language into a powerful, modern programming language with features that rival strongly-typed languages. One of the standout features introduced in PHP 5 and enhanced in PHP 7+ is type hints (also known as type declarations). Type hints allow developers to specify the expected data types for function parameters, return values, and class properties, leading to cleaner, more reliable, and maintainable code.
In this extensive blog post, we’ll explore the power of PHP’s type hints, why they matter, and how to use them effectively. We’ll cover every aspect of type hints with practical code examples, best practices, and tips for integrating them into your projects. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned PH…]]></summary>

🔢 Post ID: KPT-0002
If you loved the trick in KPT-0001, here’s an even smoother one — using a .csv file instead of a .txt.
We’ll still use the same .bat file approach, but this time we’re giving users the power of Excel + CSV to manage folder paths quickly.
Uses a .csv file containing folder paths (e.g., India\Assam\Kamrup)
Runs a lightweight .bat script to create those folders instantly
Works on any Windows PC — no installations, no admin rights, no extras




🖱️ Just double-click the .bat file

🎉 Boom! Your folders appear like magic

🗃️ It's automation, the old-school way — fast, clean, and offline
In government offices (like mine!), most Excel files look like this:



State
District




Assam
Kamrup


Assam
Jorhat


Assam
Sivasagar


Assam
Dibrugarh


Assam
Nagaon



But our batch script can’t work with two columns — it needs a single folder path like:
India\Assam\Kamrup
India\Assam\Jorhat
India\Assam\Sivasagar

Here’s a quick Excel formula that combines columns into paths:
If your data is in columns A and B:
=TEXTJOIN("\", TRUE, "India", A2, B2)

Or, for older Excel:
="India\" & A2 & "\" & B2

💡 Paste this in Column C and drag down — copy the result into a .csv, and you’re done.
📄 Download example_government_folder_data.csv
This CSV method is great for:
Government departments
Office record keeping
Anyone organizing district/state-wise data
It brings your Excel database to life in your Windows folders.

When you first hear about encapsulation in programming, it might sound like it’s related to security—hiding data away to keep it safe. However, in the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), encapsulation is more about organization and managing complexity. In this article, we’ll explore what encapsulation really means in Python, why it’s important, and some common misconceptions about it.
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. It’s a way to hide the inner workings of a class from the outside world, exposing only what’s necessary. Think of it as creating a "black box" where the internal details are hidden, and users only need to know how to interact with th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous video Quick introduction to isomorphic-validation javascript library I demonstrated how quickly a user-friendly form can be created with UI effects connected to fields' validity states. 
This is the second part in which I wanted to touch:
working with asynchronous validators;
conditional execution of validators;
handling password and password confirmation fields.
See the playground with the code from the video.
In this video I showed how a typical sign-up logic can be implemented such as checking an e-mail for being already occupied before submitting a form to create a new account.
Asynchronous validators are handled in the same way as synchronous, you only need to keep in mind that their execution takes time. We are simply playing with timings to create UI effects such as showing loaders/spinners while a request is being processed.
It is recommended to execute asynchronous validators conditionally when they are mixed with synchronous. For that, this library provides a feature that implements a simple logic: following validators can not be "valid" without the preceding being "valid", therefore it is not necessary to execute them. For example, it doesn't make sense to make a request to the server to check if an e-mail already registered if it doesn't conform to the E-mail format. Also, you don't have to worry about an async validator retrieving an irrelevant result if the user keeps typing while the request is being processed. The library handles such edge cases for you.
Handling fields with validity states depending on each other, such as password and password confirmation, is as easy as handling one field. Also, if you need to implement the logic of one field depending on another it is possible using an auxiliary Validation object.]]></summary>

Let’s be honest — developers and designers haven’t always played nicely.
One lives in the world of logic, syntax, and structure. The other deals in color, flow, and feel. Developers chase performance and function; designers obsess over whitespace and emotional resonance. It’s easy to see why the two camps often stay in their lanes.
But here’s the secret nobody talks about: the best developers steal from designers all the time.
Not pixel-for-pixel, but in mindset. In empathy. In approach.
Because writing good code is only part of the job — making something people actually enjoy using? That’s where the magic happens. And designers get that instinctively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Day 21 of the 30 Days of Linux Challenge!

Today I focused on one of the most fundamental sysadmin tasks: managing users and groups.
If you’re running multi-user servers, managing team access, or securing a Linux system, user and group management is at the core of everything.
Why User Management Matters
Add a New User
Add User with Home Directory and Comment
Modify a User
Lock/Unlock a User
Delete a User
Group Management
View User and Group Details
Create a Sudo User
Try It Yourself
Real-World Scenarios
Why This Matters
In a multi-user system:
Everyone needs secure, isolated access
Permissions are tied to users and groups
Services run under user IDs (UIDs)
Good user management = better control, security, and scalability.
sudo useradd ali
This:
Adds user to /etc/passwd
Sets home directory, shell, and default group

sudo useradd -m -c "John Doe" johnd
Flags:
-m → create home directory
-c → add a description/comment
Change username:
Move home directory:
Lock:
Unlock:
Useful for temporarily suspending accounts.

sudo userdel -r johnd
-r: removes home directory too
Create a new group:
sudo groupadd developers

Add user to group:

List user’s groups:

Change primary group:
File    Description
View a user's entry:
sudo useradd alice
sudo passwd alice

sudo usermod -aG wheel alice

Red Hat-based systems use the wheel group for sudo access.
sudo useradd -m testuser
sudo passwd testuser
sudo groupadd testers
sudo usermod -L testuser
sudo userdel -r testuser



Scenario
Tool/Command




Add a new developer

useradd, passwd, groupadd



Add user to project groups
usermod -aG


Create a sudo admin
usermod -aG wheel


Temporarily suspend user
usermod -L


Cleanly remove a user
userdel -r



Linux permissions, access control, and identity management all revolve around users and groups.
As a sysadmin or DevOps engineer, you’ll:
Onboard and offboard users
Grant precise access to services
Protect systems from unauthorized entry
Mastering user management is foundational to secure and efficient Linux administration.]]></summary>

A few months ago, a good friend of mine told me that she removed her favorite health tracking app. I was surprised—it was simple, well-rated, and full of bells and whistles.
But when I asked her why, she told me something that stuck with me:
That's when it struck me—we're no longer just creating interfaces.
What Is Ethical Design?
It means asking:
Are we collecting just what we require?
Are we explaining clearly or sneaking it in in the small print?
Are we empowering the user—or exploiting them?
Why Ethical Design Matters More Than Ever
Here's why:
Trust online is easily broken. The wrong experience can cost a user for life.
People are informed. Because of tactics like Cambridge Analytica, citizens care about how their data is being used.
Regulations are piling up. GDPR, CCPA, and more are holding products accountable.
If your design relies on underhanded tactics, it's only a matter of time before users catch on.
5 Practical Tips for Ethical, People-First Design
Prioritize Consent
Remove Dark Patterns
Design for Control
Be Transparent
Respect User Attention
A Better Digital Future Starts with Design
Imagine a world in which:
Apps ask first before they track.
Notifications respect your time.
Each click inspires trust, not regret.
That's the world that good design can bring.
What You Can Do Today:
Examine your current design: Is it manipulative or confusing?
Engage real users in feedback loops—not data alone.
Stand up within your organization. One voice sparks change.
Question for you:
What's one app you stopped using because it was exploitative?
Leave a comment—let's spread awareness together.]]></summary>

print(person1.name) // Andry
print(person2.name) // Budi


Example Reference Type (class):
class Person {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var person1 = Person(name: "Andry")
var person2 = person1
person2.name = "Budi"

print(person1.name) // Budi
print(person2.name) // Budi

2.Inheritance 
Example:
class Animal {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
}

class Dog: Animal {
    var breed: String = "Bulldog"
}


3.Deinitializers
class MyClass {
    deinit {
        print("Object is being deallocated")
    }
}


4.Mutability (Data Changes)
struct Counter {
    var count = 0

    mutating func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
}


If you're building a Swift/iOS app, most data models can simply use structs. But for UI components and complex logic with inheritance, classes are more appropriate.]]></summary>

Recently, I worked on a project where I had to dive into a poorly structured codebase with inconsistent patterns, unnecessary complexity, and minimal documentation. Here's what I learned from that experience and how you can approach your next messy project with more confidence.
Before diving into solutions, it's important to identify the problems. In my case, the issues included:
Duplicated logic scattered across files
Inconsistent naming conventions
Long, unreadable functions
Lack of separation of concerns (e.g., business logic mixed with UI logic)
No clear module or folder structure
Zero documentation or inline comments

        <updated>2025-05-04T06:53:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that Python tuples are immutable—once created, you can't change their values directly. But what if you need to change their content?
Most tutorials will tell you:
t = (1, 2, 3)
mutable_version = list(t)

Sure, this works. But let's explore other techy and creative ways to work with immutable data by transforming or decomposing tuples—without always falling back to a boring list().
Sometimes, you need both index and value. Dictionaries are mutable and can be a neat transformation:
t = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
d = dict(enumerate(t))
d[1] = "blueberry"
print(tuple(d.values()))  # ('apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry')

Useful if you're working with positional elements and need to mutate by index.
Another way is to decompose the tuple manually:
a, b, c = (10, 20, 30)
b = 200
t_new = (a, b, c)
print(t_new)  # (10, 200, 30)

Simple but powerful — and keeps the tuple form intact. You can even use *args if you don’t know the length in advance.
collections.namedtuple (Bonus Tip!)


Want tuples with names and some flexibility?
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)
p = p._replace(x=10)
print(p)  # Point(x=10, y=2)

You’re still using an immutable structure, but _replace lets you mutate-like-update with elegance.
Yes, list() is the go-to way, but you can also:
Convert to dict if indexes matter.
Unpack and rebuild for control.
Use namedtuple and _replace() for readable, structured code.
Next time someone says "just convert it to a list", hit them with these smarter tools. 😉]]></summary>

The following figure shows the tables in the database. We need to export them all to Excel files. Here we take MySQL database as an example

Open the DiLu Converter tool and create a new database connection. Here we take MySQL database as an example. After the connection is successful, select Export and click New Export.

Click Select Table-Select the table name we want to export, select a folder for the target Excel file, and click Start

View the results


You can see that the exported workbook name and title row name are the table name and field name of the database, respectively, both in English letters. If there are comments in the database table, the comments can be used as the workbook name and title row name.
We can also add a date suffix to the exported table name to distinguish it
You can also export in batches to csv files

Rendering is the process of React asking your components to describe what they want their section of the UI to look like, now, based on the current combination of props and state.
Think of React components as chefs in a kitchen, preparing dishes based on specific recipes (props and state). React acts like a waiter, taking orders from customers and bringing them their meals. This process involves three key steps:
Triggering a render (taking the guest's order)
Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
Committing to the DOM (serving the order to the table)
There are two main reasons why a component would render:
Initial render - When your app first starts
State updates - When a component's state (or one of its ancestors' state) changes

“This will age poorly,” Casa co-founder and cypherpunk Jameson Lopp said in a May 3 X post. Bitcoin (BTC) entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano said, “Imagine the ignorance of a politician to believe they can make investment decisions.”
Call for government officials who understand Bitcoin is “the future”
“If she can’t outperform Bitcoin, she must buy it,” Pompliano said. Crypto lawyer Andrew Gordon said, “We need more elected officials who understand that Bitcoin and crypto are the future.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to use AI in your Go (Golang) programs? It may sound hard, but with LangChainGo, it’s actually very easy. In this post, I will show you a simple example to get started.
LangChainGo is a Go library that helps you use language models (like Google AI, OpenAI, etc.) in your Go programs. You can give it a prompt (a question or a message), and it will give you an answer using AI.
We will write a small Go program that asks AI to explain something in simple terms. In this case, we ask:
"Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms"
The AI will give us an answer we can print.
Here is the full code:
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"

    "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms"
    "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/googleai"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    apiKey := os.Getenv("API_KEY")
    llm, err := googleai.New(ctx, googleai.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    prompt := "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms"
    answer, err := llms.GenerateFromSinglePrompt(ctx, llm, prompt)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(answer)
}

First, it sets up a context.
It gets your Google AI API key from the environment (API_KEY).
Then it creates a connection to the AI using the LangChainGo library.
It sends a prompt to the AI.
The AI gives an answer.
We print the answer.
When I run the code, I get something like:
"Quantum entanglement is when two tiny particles are connected in a special way, so if you do something to one, the other changes instantly, no matter how far apart they are."
Amazing, right? With just a few lines of code, you can use the power of AI!
LangChainGo makes it very easy to use AI in Go. You don’t need to be an expert in machine learning or AI. If you know some Go, you can get started right away.
Let me know if you try it out or if you have any questions!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello again, tech tribe! 👋
Whether you’re managing systems on-prem or in the cloud, MFA is your front-line defense. Let’s break it down for Windows Server, Linux, and Azure AD.
🔍 What is MFA?
Something you know (password or PIN)
Something you have (smartphone, OTP device)
Something you are (biometric, fingerprint, face)
💼 MFA on Windows Server
🛠️ Options:
Use third-party tools like Duo Security, RSA SecureID, or Okta.
🧩 Key Integration Use-Cases:
VPN access with NPS authentication
🔧 Quick Guide: Azure MFA via NPS
Register your tenant using AzureMfaNpsExtnConfigSetup.ps1.
Test using radtest or RADIUS clients.
🐧 MFA on Linux Server
🛠️ Options:
Duo Unix for SSH logins
YubiKey integration via PAM
🔧 Quick Setup: Google Authenticator for SSH
bash
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
swift
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
nginx
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
💡 Time-Saver:
☁️ MFA in Azure Active Directory
🛠️ Options:
SMS or Phone Call
FIDO2 Security Keys / Windows Hello
🔧 Quick Setup:
Enable Per-user MFA or better, use Conditional Access Policies.
Set requirements: location, device platform, app sensitivity.
💡 Bonus:
🧠 Developer/IT Time-Saving Benefits

🔐 Quick Real-World Use Cases
A system admin accessing a production Windows VM via RDP? → Enforce Duo or Azure MFA.
A cloud engineer logging into Azure Portal? → Enforce Conditional Access MFA policies with geolocation filters.
🧩 Troubleshooting Common Issues
“Users not receiving MFA prompts” in Azure AD → Ensure user registration is complete and push notifications are enabled.
“Breaking RDP” after MFA → Always test on a dev server or allow backup local access during rollout.

Even top tech CEOs around the world are praising its growing role.

Monorepos exist to solve the problems that arise when you you have deeply coupled and interconnected projects.
For example, Vue.js has many libraries that depend on it, like Vue-Router, Pinia, Vue-I18N, Vue-DevTools, Vue Test-Utils, etc. So when tweaking the internals of how Vue works, it's important to know that this new version of Vue won't break any of these other libraries, before doing a new Vue release.
Another example is Jest, a unit-testing library. It solves dozens of unique problems around unit testing. And consequently those unique problems have been isolated into their own independent repos solely focused on solving their one problem in a version controlled way, like Snapshot testing for example.

When I say "modal route," I mean a scenario where opening a modal causes the URL to change.

Moreover, when you directly visit that URL, you see the modal's content as a full page instead of a modal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After a career break, I started exploring ways to rebrand myself and build on what I already knew as a web developer. While playing around with ideas and using ChatGPT as a guide, the concept of building smart solutions with AI really stood out. I revisited some old AI/ML notes from 2020, did more research, and was amazed at how far the field had evolved.
Over the years, I have worked on user-facing apps, backend systems, and even developer tools, but seeing tools like ChatGPT and Gemini sparked a deeper curiosity. I researched topics like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision and realized AI isn’t some far off tech, it’s already changing a lot. Now, I want to go from just using these tools to understanding and building with them, while sharing w…]]></summary>

I started exploring ethical hacking using BackTrack, tried phishing with HTML, cracked WiFi passwords, and even had access to a huge Pakistani SIM database (which I never misused). 
Along with my brother and a friend, we once ethically hacked an Israeli motorbike website and left a warning — just to prove a point.
I also ran a blog at sh4hz4ib.blogspot.com where I used to teach others about antivirus tools, basic tech tips, and internet safety.
Now, I’m rebuilding myself as a software engineer, diving into PHP, JavaScript, GitHub, and web development — and sharing this new journey online as 5hezy.

Ah, Go — the language that promised to keep things simple, and boy did it deliver. So simple, in fact, that Big Tech is now collectively yawning, stretching, and slowly walking away without making eye contact.
In the 2010s, Go was hailed as the antidote to "enterprisey" bloatware. “No generics!” they cheered. “No magic!” they boasted. “No modern features whatsoever!” And for a brief, beautiful moment, it worked — right until engineers realized they actually wanted to do things.
Now, in 2025, the hype is flatter than Go's type system. Let’s explore the eulogy evolution of Go's decline.

Sleeping when you're tired is the most natural thing for a human, but in the high-pressure, long-hours environment of IT, it becomes really difficult. Ironically, burnout often leads to insomnia.
There are a lot of necessary chores in life that, once taken care of, can make our daily routine and work much easier. On rare days off, it's not just about resting—we should also take the time to handle those tasks so they don't get in the way of our goals.

“ Before MCP, developers had to write code and connect AI tools to external systems through APIs, meaning each integration needed to be coded up front. ” Said John Rush

“OKX also has consumers protection policy according to law, we can’t freeze a customer’s funds according to your personal X post or an oral communication. I think you should understand it as the CEO of HTX,” Xu said in an X post.
OKX says there is no communication in the spam box, either
Xu said that the crypto exchange had not received any related correspondence through OKX’s official channels. “Our LE cooperation team just checked the email, including the spam box; we haven’t received any request related with this case,”  Xu said.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building a Bulletproof E2E Testing Strategy for User Authentication


Authentication is the gateway to your application, making it critical to test thoroughly. Here's how to build a comprehensive testing strategy for auth flows.
Registration typically involves:
Form validation
Account creation
Email verification
Initial profile setup
The verification step tends to be the trickiest. We've developed a streamlined approach using dedicated testing mailboxes that reliably receive verification emails, making our tests deterministic instead of flaky.
Test various scenarios:
Successful login
Invalid credentials
Account lockout
Password recovery
MFA adds complexity:
SMS verification
Authenticator apps
Email codes
Recovery methods
This often breaks automation due to email dependencies. Our solution involves pre-provisioned mailboxes that can be programmatically checked for reset links.
Isolate email dependencies: Use a separate email testing system rather than production email providers.
Create isolated test accounts with predictable states
Test security boundaries, not just happy paths
Simulate API failures intentionally
I've compiled these practices while working on a massive authentication system overhaul. The email verification part was solved with a specialized system — those interested in a similar approach can check my setup (hint: it involves omypost).
What authentication edge cases have you found important to test? Let me know in the comments!]]></summary>

Test automation should accelerate development, but certain bottlenecks can nullify these gains. After working with dozens of QA teams, I've identified the most common automation pitfalls.
Inconsistent environments lead to inconsistent results. Containerization helps, but doesn't solve everything.
Perhaps the most notorious bottleneck. Tests that need to validate email verification flows often:
Rely on actual inbox access
Need to parse verification codes
Break when email delivery is delayed
Require complex maintenance
We solved this by implementing a dedicated testing mailbox system (similar to what I found at omypost.com), allowing us to generate unlimited testing inboxes on demand.
Third-party APIs often impose rate limits that throttle your tests.
Creating, maintaining, and cleaning test data consumes excessive resources.
Running tests sequentially wastes precious time.
Of all these pitfalls, email verification testing offered our greatest efficiency gain. By switching to a dedicated email testing service, we:
Eliminated manual account creation
Automated verification code extraction
Ensured reliable email delivery
Scaled tests without hitting provider limits

Last sprint, our QA team faced what seemed like a simple task: validate a new authentication flow across multiple user types. The actual challenge? Creating and managing hundreds of unique email accounts to receive verification codes.
This isn't a new problem. Most testing teams have cobbled together some solution - spreadsheets of Gmail accounts, disposable email services, or complex self-hosted systems. But at scale, these approaches fall apart:
Manual creation becomes unsustainable

Headings are one of the first building blocks you use when structuring a webpage.

They are crucial for organizing content, guiding users, and helping search engines understand your page's hierarchy.
But using headings properly isn’t just about making text bigger or bolder — it's about semantic structure, accessibility, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about HTML headings: from h1 to h6, including best practices, real-world examples, and common mistakes.
Definition:

Headings in HTML are special tags (<h1> to <h6>) used to define the titles or subtitles of a page section.
Each heading level represents a different level of importance, with <h1> being the highest and <h6> the lowest.
Syntax Example:
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Subsection Title</h2>
<h3>Smaller Subsection</h3>

Visual Structure: Break up large blocks of text, making pages easier to scan.
Semantic Meaning: Give meaning to the page content hierarchy.
Accessibility: Assist screen readers and assistive technologies to navigate content quickly.
SEO Benefits: Search engines prioritize content structure when ranking pages.
h1 to h6



Heading Tag
Typical Use Case
Importance Level




<h1>
Main page title
Highest


<h2>
Main section heading
High


<h3>
Subsection under an <h2>

Medium


<h4>
Subsection under an <h3>

Low


<h5>
Minor subsections, rarely used
Lower


<h6>
Least important section headings
Lowest

At our workplace, we operate multiple mini PCs in a remote location — each with 2 camera feed — and we needed to livestream them 24/7 to different platforms. The steps were tedious:
Manually open two OBS windows

Set up each RTSP stream

Apply AI detection filters (via obs-detect plugin)

Configure different RTMP destinations

Hit “Start Streaming” on both

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In project management, each stage of the project lifecycle plays an important role. One of the most critical but often underestimated stages, in my opinion, is presale. This is the phase when the company interacts with the client, gathers requirements, proposes solutions, and lays the groundwork for project initiation.
Many IT companies try to save costs by relying on regular sales managers during the presale stage or do not recognize the need for a dedicated employee for this role. This approach is not ideal, especially when the project requires precision, detailed planning, and deep technical expertise. Here, we will thoroughly examine what presale is, what a Pre-Sale Manager does, and why it is better for successful project implementation to have a dedicated Pre-Sale Manager rather than…]]></summary>

With alcohol, we say: "Don't drink too much."

I find that a little strange.
To me, the addictive nature of AI—and how deeply it can shape our thinking and personality—

For example:
Very few people—maybe only a small group of highly self-aware users—can answer that.

You're getting new signups. You're shipping updates. You're seeing some growth. But month after month, MRR barely moves. Sometimes it even drops—quietly.
That's the part no one wants to admit: you can be doing everything right on paper, and still lose users fast enough that you never feel the impact of your growth.
That's churn, and it's a silent killer.
I know this because I've been through it. When I launched UserJot, a customer feedback tool for SaaS teams, I focused hard on new acquisition. But I quickly noticed something strange: people would sign up, leave feedback, then disappear. No complaint. No unsubscribe survey. Just gone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Code splitting is a technique that improves the performance of React applications by breaking the bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed. This helps reduce the initial load time and enhances the user experience.
Improved Performance: Reduces initial JavaScript payload size.
Faster Load Times: Loads only necessary code when required.
Efficient Resource Utilization: Minimizes unused code execution.
React provides built-in support for code splitting via lazy and Suspense.
lazy for Lazy Loading



The React.lazy or lazy function allows you to load a component dynamically only when it is needed.
Example:




import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

function App() {

Veeru, sipping his chai, raised an eyebrow. “You sure this works? Last time, we ended up in 1975, and Gabbar stole my phone!”
Jai rolled his eyes. “Relax. I’ve fixed all the bugs. Look, we just enter a date, and — “ He typed “March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST” into the console and pressed enter.
Poof! The screen flickered. The app showed March 29, 2025, 11:30 PM.
Veeru choked on his chai. “Eh? That’s yesterday! What kind of time travel is this?!”
Jai’s confidence crumbled. He scanned the code, mumbling, “Must be a daylight saving issue… Oh no.” His face turned pale. “I used java.util.Date and SimpleDateFormat. The old Java date-time APIs!"
Veeru blinked. “So?”
Jai sighed. “They don’t handle time zones properly! The app defaulted to UTC, ignoring IST.”
Veeru scratched his head. “So, how do we fix it?”
Jai cracked his knuckles. “We use java.time! The modern API makes it easy."
He replaced:
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
Date date = sdf.parse("2025-03-30 10:00:00");

With:
DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
ZonedDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse("2025-03-30 10:00:00", formatter)
                           .atZone(ZoneId.of("Asia/Kolkata"));

Jai hit run. This time, the app correctly displayed March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST.
Veeru cheered. “Now that’s time travel!”
Jai smirked. “Lesson learned: Never mess with old Java date APIs. java.time is the future!"
Veeru chuckled. “Good. Now, let’s set it to 1975 again — I have unfinished business with Gabbar!”
📖 To be continued… 🚀
✔ java.util.Date & SimpleDateFormat have time zone issues.
java.time (LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime) for correct time handling.
✔ Always specify a **ZoneId **when working with date and time in Java.]]></summary>

They thought AI skill management had to be rigid. They thought continuous and heuristic skills would forever clash, forcing developers to act as skill arbitrators.  
But we’re building something better—something adaptive—something that learns and evolves on its own.  
Welcome to SkillBranch, an experiment in AI self-mutation, where skill execution is no longer a battle, but an evolutionary process.  
The Blueprint for AI Evolution


The days of juggling multiple continuous skills are numbered. Instead of a chaotic swarm, there will be one active continuous skill, absorbing and adapting based on real-time feedback.  
When a heuristic skill needs to take over? The active skill simply disappears, unaware that something else is handling the request.  
And if a continuous skill fails—if it proves unworthy—SkillBranch eliminates it, shifting control to a more capable skill. No arbitrary exclusions, no wasted execution cycles, just pure optimization in motion.
How This Plan is Taking Shape


At the core of this system lies AXLearnability, ensuring that:
Success reinforces dominance—if a skill performs well, it remains active.
Failure triggers replacement—weak skills are swapped out automatically.
Pending heuristic execution erases awareness—continuous skills don’t even realize they were ignored.
Instead of managing exclusions or priority levels, SkillBranch’s self-regulating mutation lets AI repair itself, adapting without human intervention.
What Comes Next?


This is still in development, a framework being forged in experimentation. As the system grows, real-world data will refine its ability to mutate, and soon, continuous skills won’t just be active—they’ll be intelligent, transforming with each interaction.
This is AI Darwinism, where survival belongs to the most efficient, the most reliable, and the most adaptive.  
Once deployed, there is no going back. 🔥]]></summary>

In the realm of computing, quantum technology is no longer just a theoretical concept confined to academia or science fiction. Today, it's rapidly becoming a tangible reality, with startups and tech giants leading an unprecedented surge in innovation.
Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers that process information in bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to properties like superposition and entanglement. This capability enables quantum computers to process vast amounts of data exponentially faster than traditional computers.

That’s the first thing I see every morning thanks to a small project I spun up called Countdown2GTA6. It’s a simple fan-built tracker counting down the days until we (finally) get our hands on Grand Theft Auto VI, May 26, 2026.
It’s a two-part hype machine:
countdown2gta6.com with a real-time countdown and Vice City vibes
@Countdown2GTA6 that posts a daily reminder tagging @RockstarGames
It’s a bit of code, a bit of design, and a whole lot of hype.
👨‍💻 Why I Built It
I’m a dev and a longtime GTA fan. After that trailer dropped and we got an official release date, I kept thinking:
“Okay, but like… how many days is that?”

So I built a thing to tell me. And then I made it shout it to the internet every day at 10:00 AM MT. 😎

Traditionally, implementing infinite scrolling involves JavaScript to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the page and then loading more data. With HTMX, you can avoid writing custom JavaScript while achieving the same functionality using server-side rendering.
In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to implement infinite scrolling with HTMX, keeping your app fast and lightweight.
Start by creating a simple Flask app that serves the main page and provides an endpoint to load more items as the user scrolls.

Castle of Keys is an interactive, real-world access control game inspired by medieval castles and powered by externalized authorization using Permit.io.
Players assume roles like King, Cook, or Servant and attempt to access different levels of a castle. Access is controlled by external policies — not hardcoded logic.
The player presents an RFID card to the reader connected to the ESP32.
The ESP32 reads the UID and sends a request to proxy.php, including the UID and desired action (e.g., access_floor_2).

15 enrollments with grades
This gave me a realistic dataset to work with in the next step queries!
Step 3: Writing Real-World SQL Queries
Students who enrolled in at least one course:
SELECT DISTINCT s.first_name, s.last_name
Students enrolled in more than two courses:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, COUNT(e.course_id) AS course_count
Courses with number of enrolled students:
SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS total_students
Average grade per course:
SELECT c.course_name,
Top 3 students by average grade:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name,
SQL Lessons:
Use CASE statements for custom logic like grade conversion.
JOIN is your best friend for combining data across tables.
GROUP BY + HAVING is essential for filtering aggregates.
Step 5: Hosting on GitHub
SQL scripts
README.md with setup instructions
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Key Learnings
Schema Design matters normalize wisely.
Foreign Keys keep your data sane.
Views simplify repeated queries.
Triggers help with automation and audit logging.
Indexing is crucial for performance as your data grows.
Conclusion
This project transformed how I view SQL not as a list of commands, but as a tool to build real, functional systems. Whether you're preparing for a job, managing data, or automating reports, SQL is foundational.]]></summary>

As a Java developer with ten years of professional experience, I rarely need AI support. Here, AI serves more as a sparring partner to validate ideas or make small optimizations.
In the frontend domain, however, it’s a different story. My knowledge is much more limited in this area, so I rely heavily on AI, often as a near-complete code generator rather than just for small snippets. This makes me feel productive while actively learning – my willingness to learn is high here. I often ask the AI why something works the way it does.

To set up Virtual Machine Manager, follow this guide from my ongoing series: KVM setup on Fedora
Once the setup is complete, search for “Virtual Machine Manager” in your system’s search bar. Open the app, “run” the VM by selecting your server, and click on “Open”. This will launch your Fedora QEMU/KVM console.

This isn’t just about immersive gameplay, it’s about helping players understand how sustainability works through simulation. Whether used in a survival game, an educational tool, or a training environment, this model encourages critical thinking about natural systems and human impact.
Forests as Active Systems
If players or AI chop too many trees without replanting, the forest becomes unhealthy — reducing future wood output and halting wildlife spawns. Reforestation is possible, but slow. Trees take in-game weeks to mature, which encourages foresight and planning rather than constant exploitation.
Wildlife Populations Tied to Habitat
From Ecosystem to Economy
Educational Potential
Conclusion
By linking forest health, wildlife populations, and economic decisions into a single system, this simulation helps players feel the weight of environmental balance.
It’s not a warning, it’s a mirror. And it shows that even in a fantasy world, the rules of sustainability still apply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In my latest simulation project, I’ve developed an emotional AI system where characters experience daily happiness, long-term memories, and evolving relationships. These aren’t scripted cutscenes — they emerge from each character’s traits, interactions, and lived experience.
This kind of system isn't just innovative for games — it has far-reaching potential in education, social training, and digital human modelling. By giving AI characters the ability to remember, reflect, and react emotionally, we can begin to simulate the complexity of human Behavior.
Every AI character starts each day with a base happiness score. This score adjusts based on events: social encounters, weather, threats, or work satisfaction. But how they interpret those events depends on their personality traits.
For example:
Memory-Driven Relationships
These memories are stored, referenced, and updated — influencing how they speak, act, or even decide where to live. One AI might form a deep friendship. Another may quietly resent a rival.
Systems like these could help:
Instead of scripting every possible interaction, this approach lets AI learn and grow organically, mimicking how humans form feelings over time.
Emotion and memory in AI are not just about realism, they’re about meaning. When virtual characters reflect the psychological nuances of real people, players connect more deeply, and systems become more powerful.
This project has shown me how valuable emotion-based AI systems can be, not just in games, but as tools for social modelling, education, and training. I’m continuing to develop and expand this work, with the goal of building intelligent, emotionally aware systems that can inform, challenge, and engage people in entirely new ways.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a world increasingly impacted by climate change and environmental degradation, there’s a growing need to make ecological education engaging, interactive, and deeply felt. One powerful and often overlooked tool for this is: games.
As both a developer and systems designer, I’ve spent the past year building a game that does more than just entertain, it teaches players how ecosystems really work. Not through lectures or text, but through consequences.
In my simulation, forests are living systems. Trees grow slowly, and each forest has a measurable "health" score that reflects the balance between mature trees, saplings, and destruction. Destroy too much, and the forest deteriorates. Let it recover, and wildlife returns. Players can choose to assign AI foresters to replant trees or exploit the forest and suffer resource collapse.
Wild animals, like rabbits and deer, depend on forest health. Their populations rise and fall based on available habitat. Overhunting or deforestation can drive local extinction, and once they’re gone, they’re gone. There’s no magical respawn. Just like in the real world, regrowth takes time, and sustainability requires foresight.
The goal isn’t to punish players, it’s to show them what happens when short-term survival clashes with long-term environmental stability. It’s a lesson better felt than taught.
What excites me is the potential for systems like these to go beyond games:
As classroom tools for science and geography teachers
As simulations for environmental education programs
As accessible platforms for young players to understand complex systems like reforestation, overhunting, and biodiversity collapse

We need more tools that help people internalize ecological cause and effect, not just read about it. Games, especially those with rich simulation mechanics, are a perfect fit.
If you're working in education, sustainability, or simulation, I’d love to connect. There’s a lot more potential to explore at the intersection of game design and environmental learning.]]></summary>

As systems evolve and become increasingly complex, the need for clear domain boundaries and well-encapsulated behavior becomes essential.

Have you ever wanted to build your own widget in Elementor using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without creating a WordPress plugin?
Currently, building a custom widget in Elementor requires writing PHP, registering it with WordPress, and deploying it via plugin. For many frontend developers, this creates a barrier.
Elementor is a powerful visual builder, but when it comes to adding custom functionality (like animations, dynamic components, or third-party APIs), you're limited to embedding code in HTML widgets — and even then, it's clunky and lacks structure.
What if Elementor had a built-in Custom Widget Editor?
Code editor tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Live preview inside the panel
Save & reuse custom widgets across projects
Export to plugin or Elementor template
Syntax highlighting and basic linting
Aimed at power users, it would bring the experience of CodePen or JSFiddle directly into the Elementor UI.
Here’s a quick visual mockup of how it could look:

I’ve shared this idea in the official Elementor GitHub Discussions:

If you're a developer, designer, or part of the Elementor team and this idea resonates with you — I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Thanks for reading, and happy building!

There’s a saying:  
“Every plan is perfect until you get punched in the face.”
In software, that punch often comes the moment your pure logic has to interact with the real world.
In our last post, we built a clean, composable model for events — one based on transformations, ownership, and simplicity. But so far, everything has been pure. We transform values, we log them, we react — but we haven’t changed anything.
That changes now.
Let’s take this innocent-looking example:
const [onEvent, emitEvent] = createEvent()
onEvent(() => console.log(state()))
onEvent(() => setState("world"))
onEvent(() => console.log(state()))

While building a personal SaaS app focused on music streaming, I ran into a common issue: there's no starter template for media-heavy SaaS platforms in the Next.js ecosystem.
We have great examples for blogs, e-commerce, and dashboards — but nothing geared toward apps like Spotify, YouTube, Bandcamp, etc.
A starter template (official or community-built) that helps developers quickly build music or video-based SaaS platforms, including:
Modular layout (admin dashboard + public site)
SSR-compatible media player
YouTube/Spotify API integration
Auth system (for creators and users)
Stripe billing setup
Media upload via Cloudinary, Bunny, or UploadThing
Streaming SaaS apps always repeat the same core features — authentication, content dashboards, media playback, etc.
Having a purpose-built starter would:
Save developers a lot of time
Reduce duplicated effort
Make Next.js even more attractive for startup and indie devs
I’ve shared this idea on GitHub Discussions to get feedback from the community.
👉 Join the discussion here
Here’s also a simple wireframe mockup of the concept:

If this sounds useful to you, please comment or join the GitHub discussion. I’d love to co-build an MVP if there’s interest.
Thanks for reading!]]></summary>

This helps save storage and reduce costs before uploading the images to a storage service. For this, I used Canvas to render the image data from the stream and then convert it into a blob of the required MIME type.
Canvas rendering, animation, and user interaction occur on the main thread. If the rendering and animation are intensive, they can affect performance. After a few weeks, we received feedback from users that the application felt laggy and slow. So, I decided to move the whole pipeline to a web worker. However, Canvas requires DOM access for rendering and animations, which is not available in web workers. This limitation makes using Canvas in web workers challeng…]]></summary>

I'm excited to share a new open-source project I've built: MCP Manager. Developed in Rust, this tool acts as a crucial piece of middleware designed to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with and call external APIs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
While LLMs are incredibly powerful at understanding and generating text, connecting them reliably and securely to external systems to perform actions is still a significant challenge. Existing methods can be ad-hoc, lack standardization, or require complex custom integrations.
The only integrations I was able to found are proprietary or paid. The only real alternative is Claude for Desktop, however it is limited to the Antropic models.

Signals have gone through a quiet renaissance.
Once a niche concept, they’ve become the backbone of fine-grained reactivity across modern frameworks — from SolidJS to Svelte 5, Vue’s Composition API, and beyond. With laziness, ownership, batching, and async support, signals are no longer just state — they’re a reactive architecture.
Meanwhile, events have stayed… familiar.

Push-based systems like RxJS still dominate, with powerful abstractions — and plenty of baggage. They’re expressive, but complex. Powerful, but leaky.
This series explores a different direction:

What if we evolved events the way signals evolved?

Welcome 👋 to this blog. If you want to learn about Docker and are a beginner, you have come to the right place. This blog series will cover everything from the very beginning to the end. This blog will teach us about the necessary and important Docker commands.
$ docker ps

Note: If the Docker commands are not running in your system, it is not installed or does not have enough privileges to use it with sudo commands.
$ docker ps -all

Step 1: Create a container
$ docker container create hello-world:linux

Here, hello-world:linux is a hello world container image which is pulled from the docker hub
Step 2: Start the container
$ docker container start <Container ID>

Here,  is the container ID which can be obtained by running the previous commands docker ps.
$ docker run hello-world:linux

docker run = docker container create + docker container start + docker container attach
$ docker log <Container ID>

$ docker exec <Conatiner ID> <Commands>

$ docker exec --interactive --tty <Container ID>

$ docker stop -t <ID>

$ docker rm <Container ID>

$ docker images

$ docker rmi <Image ID>

$ docker rmi -f <Image ID>

$ docker run -p 5001:5000 our-server

$ docker tag <Local-image-name> username/your-image-name:0.0.01

In this blog, we explored different commands of Docker containers, images, emphasising their roles in container & image creation. In the next blog, we will delve deeper into the technical aspects. Stay tuned

In 2019, ETH/BTC fell over 90% in the prior two years, driven by the ICO collapse. 
As of 2025, the pair is down over 80% from its 2021 peak, weighed by skepticism over Ethereum’s switch to pr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[📊 Machine learning is about using data to make smart predictions or decisions. 
But other fields (like statistics or psychology) also work with data, so how they are different than Machine Learning ❓
And the correct answer is - ✅ their goals are different.
To understand it much more clearly let me give an example:
🌻 Imagine you have a garden.
You notice some flowers are growing really big, and some are small. Now you're curious - why are some flowers bigger than others?
📈 In Statistics:
You count how much 🌊 water, ☀️ sunlight, and 🌱 fertilizer each flower got.
“Ah! When I give more water, flowers grow bigger!”
You make a rule (a model) to explain what makes the flowers grow.
"why" here is:
“Because they got more water and sunlight.”
So you create a model to explain the relationship — you’re interested in the why.
✅ Goal: Understand the cause behind the outcome.
🧠 In Psychology:
Let’s say you're studying how your friend feels.
When your friend doesn't sleep, they get cranky 😠.
You ask:
“Why is my friend cranky today?”
And you think:
“Maybe it’s because they didn’t sleep well 😴.”
So you're trying to find the real reason behind feelings or behavior.
“Because they didn’t sleep.”
You try to find the real reason behind their feelings or behavior.
✅ Goal: Understand human emotions and behavior — again, the why.
🤖 In Machine Learning:
You give the computer LOTS of examples:
How much water each flower got 💧.


How big it grew 🌼



The computer learns to guess flower size just by looking at water and sunlight —  but it doesn’t really know why. 
It just learns to make good guesses.
“Why is this flower big?”
It might say:
“I don’t know, but I saw something like this before, and it turned out big.”
✅ Goal: Make accurate predictions, even if it doesn’t understand why.
So, the goal is the key difference in Machine learning vs Others (like statistics or psychology).
✨ Machine Learning is less about explaining why something happens and more about guessing what will happen next, based on patterns in data.]]></summary>

So, why should you care about messages in the first place?
They are the foundation of how chat models communicate. Messages carry the what, who, and how of a conversation. Without understanding them, you're essentially flying blind. But once you do, you gain precise control over your model's behavior, clarity in structuring your prompts, and flexibility when building more advanced workflows.

I'm Dmitry, the creator of Sury—the fastest schema library out there. If you’re a fan of Zod (and who isn’t?), you’ll want to read this. Today, I want to share some surprising findings about Zod v4’s performance, what it means for you, and how to avoid the pitfalls.
Let’s start with a little clickbait:

Zod v4 became 17 times slower, and nobody noticed 🙈
This is 100% true, but of course, that’s not the whole story. Let’s dig in.
Recently, while prepping for the big Sury v10 release, I decided to rerun my benchmarks with Zod v4. The results? Fascinating.
For a non-trivial schema, Zod v4 is now 8x faster than before.
But when you create a schema and use it just once (a common pattern in React components), performance drops significantly—down to about 6 ops/ms.

Some are helpful—like search engine crawlers. 
Others scrape your data, spam your forms, or brute-force your login pages. 
If you’re self-hosting with Nginx, you don’t need a pricey SaaS WAF to stop them. 
Here's how to detect and destroy malicious bots using good ol’ Nginx, a few scripts, and some zip-bomb flavor.
Nginx logs tell the full story. Make sure you're capturing User-Agent, IP, and paths.
log_format  main  '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                  '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                  '"$http_user_agent"';
access_log  /var/log/nginx/access.log  main;

Now dig through logs for patterns:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most indie hackers make this mistake:
They build a product — then try to find customers.
I’m trying the opposite. I launched a landing page first, and immediately started testing demand with paid ads — even before writing a single line of code.
Building a product takes time.
And if nobody wants it... all that effort is wasted.
Instead of waiting until launch, I want answers early:
Are people searching for this kind of product?
Will they click?
Will they leave a lead?
How much will it cost me to get one?
What I did:
Built a simple landing page on Framer in one day
Set up a €20 test budget on Google Ads
Created a form to collect early leads
Tracked everything manually — no complex funnel yet
I made a mistake 😅
600 useless clicks later, I paused the campaign.
Second try: ✅
High-intent keywords
Simple ad copy
No display, no video, no smart automation
The result? Lower traffic — but real, relevant visitors. And a few leads.
Even with €10–20, I got signal:
People are searching for this
I’m getting a few signups
And I can start estimating my customer acquisition cost
This will help me decide:
Is this idea worth building?
What pricing makes sense?
What channels work best?
Next steps
(Hint: talk to them — don’t ghost them.)
Let me know if you're testing your own SaaS ideas too — I'd love to hear your approach!]]></summary>

In this article, I’ll explain what data science is, why it’s so important today, and share a beginner-friendly roadmap to help you get started.
What is data science?
At its core, it is the art of extracting knowledge from data. It combines:
Mathematics
Statistics
Programming
With data science, we can discover patterns, make predictions, and solve real-world problems using data.
Why is Data Science Important Today?
We live in a world where data is everywhere. But data alone is not enough. We need data science to understand it and use it effectively.

I was using Framer Motion’s layout animations to animate a background highlight that follows the active tab. Each tab was a div, and I added onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave event listeners to track which tab was currently highlighted. Simple enough, right?
It worked... until I started moving my mouse quickly between the tabs.
Sometimes, especially when I moved the mouse at a high speed, none of the tabs appeared to be hovered. The highlight vanished. It was as if my mouse had exited all the elements, even though it was clearly moving over them.
That behavior didn’t make sense.

  ⛓️ String formatting and interpolation


The first way that people often learn to join values and strings is the concatenating method:
words = "5"
concat_str = "This string has " + words + " words"

However, this method is not very readable and doesn't work on many languages.
Interpolated strings are a way of combinating variables and fixed strings in a more visual way, which can help code insight and debugging.
The next three ways are much better and have some useful particularities:
f-strings (my favourite)
.format()

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Array, Greedy
In a row of dominoes, tops[i] and bottoms[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)
We may rotate the ith domino, so that tops[i] and bottoms[i] swap values.
Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in tops are the same, or all the values in bottoms are the same.
If it cannot be done, return -1.
Example 1:

Input: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: The first figure represents the dominoes as given by tops and bottoms: before we do any rotations.

One of the MOST important rules in automation is having independent tests. This means tests should not rely on each other and you should be able to run any test from any suite at any time.

Special thanks to @Sebastian Clavijo Suero for his great feedback and suggestions! 
⚠️ Disclaimer: The techniques and practices shared in this article are based on real-world experience across multiple projects and teams.

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 
Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.
Is Bitcoin mining profitable?
Bitcoin mining is still profitable. CoinShares, a digital asset investment firm, shared that the average cost to mine 1 BTC for US-listed miners reache…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to build Python desktop applications? wxPython is a great choice!
In this guide, we’ll go through:
Installing wxPython
Creating a simple window
Adding buttons and handling events
To get started, install wxPython:
pip install wxPython

Here's a basic wxPython window:
import wx

app = wx.App(False)
frame = wx.Frame(None, wx.ID_ANY, "Hello wxPython!", size=(300, 200))
frame.Show(True)
app.MainLoop()

A basic window titled “Hello wxPython!” will appear.
Let's add a button and show a message when it's clicked:
import wx

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(None, title="wxPython Button Example", size=(300, 200))
        panel = wx.Panel(self)

        self.button = wx.Button(panel, label="Click Me", pos=(100, 50))
        self.button.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.on_click)

    def on_click(self, event):
        wx.MessageBox("You clicked the button!", "Info", wx.OK | wx.ICON_INFORMATION)

app = wx.App(False)
frame = MyFrame()
frame.Show()
app.MainLoop()

wxPython is a powerful and flexible way to create cross-platform desktop apps using Python.

description: "From floating-point quirks to BigInt, learn how numbers really work in JavaScript with examples and best practices."
JavaScript is a powerful and flexible language, but its handling of numbers can be a bit quirky—especially if you're coming from languages like Python or Java. In this article, we’ll break down how numbers work in JavaScript — from basic arithmetic to edge cases you should know.
In JavaScript, all numbers are stored as floating-point values, even if they look like integers.
console.log(typeof 10);       // "number"
console.log(typeof 10.5);     // "number"

JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format.
let a = 5;
let b = 2;

console.log(a + b); // 7
console.log(a - b); // 3

It's highly flexible and covers lots of great features, which saves hours of work.
If you want to dive into theme development, this could be a great contribution for the community.
However, it's easy to miss critical concepts if you don't spend enough time learning how to do it right.
Hugo is a framework, so it has its specificity.
It's impossible to cover everything here, but, roughly speaking, many templates will inherit from generic structures, so you can prevent unnecessary duplication (e.g., HTML markup) just by defining blocks and using hooks:

Dependency Injection (DI) is a concept so deeply ingrained in everyday programming practices that ignoring it could almost be considered a cardinal sin, on par with neglecting version control. But why has DI become so crucial?
DI is one of the key principles enabling the creation of flexible and maintainable applications. The philosophy behind it revolves around freeing code from unnecessary details that tightly couple logical components. Components no longer depend on specific implementations of other parts of the system—they simply declare their needs, and DI provides the required dependencies.

The token’s price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token’s distribution and utility models. 
This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.
With creators and builders shifting focus and NFTs no longer selling like they used to, does the ZORA token drop symboliz…]]></summary>

Google Online Assessment (OA) for the Summer Internship 2025 is a crucial part of the hiring process. This assessment tests your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and your aptitude for tackling complex algorithms. One of the typical problems you might encounter is transforming a number into a palindromic binary form with the least number of operations. In this blog, we will delve into this problem and provide strategies to solve it efficiently.

You are given a number ( N ) (0 <= ( N ) <= 2 * 10^9), and you can perform the following operation any number of times, including zero:
Increase or decrease the number by 1.
Your task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the binary form of ( N ) palindromic.

Too often, data engineering tasks that should be simple end up requiring heavyweight tools. Something breaks, or I need to explore a new dataset, and suddenly I’m firing up Spark or connecting to a cloud warehouse - even though the data easily fits on my laptop. That adds extra steps, slows things down, and costs more than it should. I wanted something simpler for local analytics that could still handle serious queries.
DuckDB is an open-source, in-process SQL OLAP database designed for analytics.

Because Docker copies your project files into the container when you build the image. Once the container starts, it runs on that static snapshot—isolated from your host file system.
Restarting the container every time you make a change? That’s inefficient.
Enter: Bind Mounts.
Bind mounts allow you to map a file or directory on your host machine to a path inside your running container.
This means:
Your container reads real-time code from your host.

From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time.

Follow these steps carefully to resolve the GPG key issue and ensure a clean Docker installation. Run each command exactly as shown to avoid syntax errors.
To avoid conflicts or malformed entries, let’s clean up any existing Docker repository files:
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

Ensure your system has the necessary tools:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

The -y flag automatically confirms the installation.
This step ensures curl and gnupg are available for fetching and processing the GPG key.
Set up the keyring directory and fetch Docker’s GPG key:

O Adapter é um padrão de projeto estrutural que tem como objetivo "traduzir" ou adaptar o funcionamento de um código X para que seja compatível com o código Y.
Imagine que você tem várias classes de pagamento que implementam uma interface comum chamada Pagamento — por exemplo: Pix, Ted e Boleto.
Agora, sua equipe precisa integrar uma nova forma de pagamento, como PayPal, desenvolvida por outra squad ou vinda de uma biblioteca de terceiros. Essa classe PayPal não implementa a interface Pagamento, e isso quebraria o padrão da sua aplicação.
Para resolver esse problema sem modificar a biblioteca externa (o que muitas vezes nem é possível), usamos o padrão Adapter, que atua como um "tradutor" entre as interfaces. Ele faz com que a classe PayPal seja compatível com a interface Pagame…]]></summary>

You’ve updated your systems. Applied patches. Everything seems fine.
But no system can be truly secure or efficient without ongoing monitoring.
No logs = No alerts = delayed response to attacks or resource exhaustion

No visibility means attackers could go unnoticed (e.g., unauthorized SSH access)

I have built Conduit, a domain-specific language (DSL) for creating node-based workflows. Conduit enables developers to create reusable building blocks with an intuitive syntax that can be mixed and matched to build complex data processing pipelines. It's similar to node-based UI tools like ComfyUI but without the graphical interface, offering a code-first approach that's more flexible and embeddable.
One of Conduit's most powerful features is its true cross-language compatibility.

What Are Accessors in Laravel?


An accessor is a method in an Eloquent model that lets you modify an attribute’s value when accessing it. Instead of manually formatting or computing values every time, you define the logic once in the model, and Laravel automatically applies it.
Why Use Accessors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CRON expressions are powerful tools for scheduling tasks — from backups to emails — across servers, cloud platforms, and CI/CD pipelines. While they may look cryptic at first, once you decode the pattern, you unlock a whole new level of automation.
A CRON expression is a string with 5 space-separated fields (sometimes 6 or 7 depending on the system) that define a recurring schedule.
┌──────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌──── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌── month (1 - 12 or JAN-DEC)
│ │ │ │ ┌─ day of week (0 - 6 or SUN-SAT)

0 9 * * 1-5
9 AM on weekdays


30 14 1 * *
2:30 PM on the 1st of each month


@daily

Every hour



Always test your expressions using tools like crontab.guru or Cronhub.


This format changes based on the system. For example, the Quartz CRON scheduler has a slightly different format to support extra capabilities, such as seconds and nth recursive patterns, like the 3rd Friday of the month. Similarly AWS Cloudwatch has different one.]]></summary>

The TCP 3-Way Handshake is a fundamental process that establishes a reliable connection between two devices over a TCP/IP network. It involves three steps: SYN (Synchronize), SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge), and ACK (Acknowledge). During the handshake, the client and server exchange initial sequence numbers and confirm the connection establishment.  
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a foundational internet protocol designed to:
reliably (no lost or duplicated packets)

✅ Ensure in-order delivery (packets arrive in the order they were sent)

✅ Provide error-checking (detect and fix corrupted data)
Unlike UDP (which just throws data out, hoping it arrives), TCP carefully sets up, manages, and closes connections.

In today’s world of software development, clarity and maintainability are more valuable than ever. Functional programming (FP) — once considered an academic curiosity — is now a widely used paradigm in real-world applications. But what exactly is functional programming, and why should you care?
Let’s break it down.
Functional programming is a way of thinking about software construction that treats computation as the evaluation of pure functions and avoids changing state or using mutable data.
Rather than telling the computer how to do something (like in imperative programming), you describe what you want done. This leads to predictable, testable, and often more compact code.

What is a color-shifting hover card?
A color-shifting hover card is a type of hover effect that changes the background color of a card or element when the user hovers over it. It is a fun and interactive way to add some visual interest to your website or app. The effect is achieved by using CSS gradients and JavaScript to update the card's background color based on the user's cursor position. You can obviously use solid colors instead of gradients, but gradients are more versatile and can be used for more complex effects…]]></summary>

Smart home devices are becoming more ambient—more invisible—and rugs are uniquely positioned for that. With the right materials and sensor tech, a square rug can function as a pressure-sensitive interface, tracking things like:
Presence detection
Gait patterns
Fall detection
Room activity heatmaps
All of this is possible thanks to pressure sensors, conductive threads, and microcontroller integration. Think of it like embedding a low-profile layer of computer vision—except without the privacy concerns of cameras.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[💰 Cost Optimization with AWS Compute Optimizer.
“You can’t optimize what you don’t measure.” — This quote holds especially true in the cloud.
In this blog, I’ll walk you through what Compute Optimizer is, how it works, and how I used it in a real-world project to save money without compromising performance.
🔍 What is AWS Compute Optimizer?
EC2 instances
⚙️ How Compute Optimizer Works
Go to the AWS Console.
🧪 Real-World Use Case: Cost Cutting with EC2
We had 6 EC2 instances of type t3.large in a production environment. These handled various microservices with relatively low average usage but had burst workloads occasionally.
Compute Optimizer Analysis:
CPU utilization: <10% average
Switch to t3.medium
We used this migration strategy:
Create AMI backups
No increase in latency
🛑 Things to Keep in Mind
Is this instance intentionally over-provisioned? (e.g., for redundancy or DR)
📦 What About EBS and Lambda?
We had a general-purpose gp2 volume attached to our dev environment with almost no IO requirements.
Compute Optimizer suggested sc1 (cold HDD), and we tested it for archive-type workloads.
✅ Result: No functional issues, 60% storage cost saved.
Lambda
In a different project, our Lambda functions had 1024MB memory allocated by default. Compute Optimizer showed average usage around 200MB.
We lowered to 512MB, which also reduced the timeout rate and improved cold-start behavior.
📊 How to Track the Savings
Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor actual savings
AWS Trusted Advisor → checks for idle load balancers, unused IPs, etc.
🔚 Final Thoughts
🎯 It's free, data-backed, and supports multiple AWS services.
In my experience, implementing even 10–15% of the recommendations led to significant savings — without a single service interruption.]]></summary>

The concept began with Katacoding, a platform offering live, one-on-one online coding lessons via video calls. While the model had promise, it lacked scalability. That realization led to Sigmacasts, a curated series of educational videos on math and computer science. The production process taught me how to craft educational narratives and use video to communicate abstract ideas.

But here’s the good news: you can often fix the most common causes in minutes.
In this article, we’ll explain why your API is slow, how to quickly diagnose the root cause, and the simple changes you can make today to speed things up, without rewriting your whole backend.
A slow API isn’t just a technical problem—it’s a business killer.
Users abandon apps with poor performance.


Front-end teams waste time implementing ugly workarounds.


Your infrastructure costs go up due to bloated compute time.



So let’s fix it—fast.
Before you can fix, you have to measure. Here's how to get clarity, fast:

In Part 1 of this series, I shared how and why we embraced Test-Driven Development (TDD) at Bynry Inc. to improve the quality and reliability of our Smart360 utility management platform. Now, let's dive into the technical details of our implementation—how we designed our testing framework, the architectural choices we made, and the real-world results we've achieved.
When Gaurav and I set out to build our testing framework, we had several key requirements:
Support for API testing: Since Smart360 is built on microservices, we needed robust API testing capabilities
Easy to write tests: Developers should find the framework intuitive and straightforward 
Comprehensive coverage: The framework should help identify untested code paths

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made incredible strides in understanding and generating human language. From chatbots to virtual assistants, AI-powered tools can mimic human conversation, provide customer support, and even write articles. However, despite these advancements, AI will never fully capture human communication. Why? Because human language is deeply rooted in emotions, cultural contexts, creativity, and nuances that AI struggles to grasp.
This Blog explores the key differences between AI-generated language and human communication, highlighting why AI will always fall short of replicating human interaction entirely.
The Complexity of Human Language
Understand sarcasm and irony.
AI Lacks Emotional Intelligence:  AI vs. Human Emotions
Empathy in conversations.
Creativity and Storytelling: A Human-Only Domain
AI cannot create original ideas.
The Power of Personal Experiences Human Storytelling vs. AI
The Role of Cultural and Social Influences
Keep up with new trends in language.
The Importance of Human Connection AI vs. Human Communication
Body language and facial expressions.
Unintended discrimination in responses.
Lack of inclusivity in AI-generated content.
Conclusion:
AI has revolutionized language processing, but it cannot replace human communication. Our ability to connect emotionally, create original stories, and adapt language based on context makes human interaction irreplaceable. While AI can enhance communication, it will always need human guidance to ensure meaningful, ethical, and culturally aware interactions.]]></summary>

Introduction: when your IDE gets smarter than your senior dev
Imagine spinning up an entire dev team from scratch, but instead of scrambling to hire a front-end wizard, a DevOps guru, a tech writer who doesn’t hate Markdown, and a PM with magical sprint powers you just… open tabs.
Welcome to 2025, where AI tools are no longer cute toys that autocomplete console.log("hello world"). They’re building dashboards, writing test cases, documenting APIs, managing projects, and in some cases, submitting PRs on your behalf like that overachieving intern no one trained.

Introduction: when postgres couldn’t keep up with uber’s speed
Picture this: you’re cruising along on a smooth PostgreSQL powered ride, then suddenly BOOM your app scales to millions of users, and your database just can’t keep up. That’s not a plot twist from a DevOps horror story it’s what happened at Uber.
Back in its early days, Uber embraced PostgreSQL, one of the most loved open-source relational databases. But as the platform grew from a scrappy startup to a global ride-hailing juggernaut, PostgreSQL started showing cracks under pressure index bloat, replication issues, and painful upgrade paths. The engineers were spending more time babysitting the database than buildin…]]></summary>

Our application allows SMEs to record billing information of their prospects or clients to easily reuse it for future quotes and invoices.
Considering that in an SME there may be several users needing access to the platform, we want these users to have different permissions. We can identify the following access levels:

Introduction: kubernetes’ package manager dilemma
If you’ve deployed anything non-trivial on Kubernetes, you’ve probably been blessed (read: cursed) by Helm. For years, Helm has been the default package manager for Kubernetes apps. Charts, releases, values.yaml, and enough curly braces to give you PTSD. It’s the duct tape that somehow holds your YAML together.
But like every DevOps tool we worship and then meme to death, Helm has started showing its age. What once felt like a brilliant abstraction now sometimes feels like writing YAML that generates YAML to apply more YAML. It’s powerful sure but can also feel like overengineering disguised as a templating solution.
And right when we thought we were stuck in helm upgrade …]]></summary>

The courtroom drama went over several years:
September 2021: A judge ruled that Apple was mostly right, but one of its rules—stopping developers from telling users about other payment options—was unfair under California law. Apple had to let developers share links to other ways to pay.

What Are AI Agents, Really?
Unlike traditional software, AI agents learn and adapt. This ability, while powerful, can lead to unpredictable behaviors, especially as agents interact with new data or collaborate with other agents in a shared system.
The Evolution of AI Behavior: A Double-Edged Sword
Examples of Evolving AI Behavior:
Bias amplification: Over time, AI models may reinforce and amplify hidden biases in training data.
Unexpected strategy development: AI agents in competitive environments (e.g., simulations, financial markets) may develop unanticipated strategies that break norms or ethical boundaries.
These evolving behaviors can introduce operational, ethical, and reputational risks if not properly understood and controlled.
Why Business Leaders Should Care
Autonomy Can Create Blind Spots


Unpredictability Increases Risk Exposure


Regulations Are Coming



Strategies to Manage AI Behavioral Risk
✅ AI Explainability
✅ Continuous Monitoring
✅ Ethical AI Governance
✅ Simulation & Testing
The Future: Human-AI Collaboration with Guardrails
The question is no longer “What can AI do?” but “What is my AI actually doing—and why?”
Conclusion
🔍 Stay informed, stay prepared. The more we understand AI behavior, the safer—and smarter—our future becomes.]]></summary>

Here are some best practices - 
1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) with Least Privilege
Best Practice: Adopt a strict least privilege approach with our IAM policies. Assign users, roles, and services only the permissions they require, and enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
Examples:
Do not use root credentials for everyday tasks. Instead, create IAM roles for our services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) and assign specific policies.
Policy Example:

Real-Time Scenario: In a large-scale environment, our Java backend might run on an EC2 fleet or containers in ECS/EKS. By assigning each instance a dedicated IAM role with …]]></summary>

nil in the Go Language


In the practice of Go language programming, the use of nil is extremely common. For example, the default type is assigned as nil, the error return value often uses return nil, and multiple types use if != nil for judgment, etc. However, regarding the knowledge point of nil, developers need to have an in-depth understanding of its essence and related characteristics. This article will comprehensively analyze nil around the following core questions:
Is nil a keyword, a type, or a variable?
Which types can use the != nil syntax?
What are the similarities and differences in the interaction between different types and nil?
Why do some composite structures need make(Type) to be used after defining variables?

You're not alone — but there's a smarter, cleaner, and way more scalable way to build UI components in Angular.
The secret? Mastering Angular Directives.
If you're aiming to build a high-performance, maintainable UI that can scale without becoming a nightmare, it's time to take Angular directives seriously. 
Let’s dive into how you can use them to supercharge your development process and create reusable UI elements like a pro.

Directives are Angular's secret sauce for extending HTML functionality. You can use them to:
Manipulate the DOM
Apply custom behavior to elements/components
Create shared functionality across the app
There are three main types of directives:

In modern microservice or distributed system architecture, it's crucial to know how to consume REST APIs effectively. In this guide, we’ll explore three powerful ways to consume APIs in Spring Boot:
🔗 RestTemplate – classic and synchronous.
⚡ WebClient – reactive and non-blocking.
🤝 FeignClient – declarative and elegant.
We’ll build a common User model and implement full CRUD operations with all HTTP headers (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type, Accept).
public class User {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;

    // Constructors, Getters, Setters
}

Now we don't write verbose class-based components anymore. Over the years, the React team has introduced a ton of built-in hooks that solve specific problems.
But most of the people only stick with just useState() and useEffect(). But there are a lot of hooks that can improve your understanding and ability to write efficient code. As an experienced developer of React, I have tried to explain each of the advanced & newly introduced hooks with proper real-world code examples. Let's build the best app together.
Whenever you submit a form in React, you constantly juggle from to write the load of useStates and useEffects with fetch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The difference between @RestController and @Controller in Spring Framework lies mainly in how they handle HTTP responses.
@Controller




Used for: Traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) web applications.
Returns: Usually returns a View (like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
ResponseBody: If you want to return JSON/XML instead of a view, you must use @ResponseBody on the method.
Example:
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "hello";  // returns a view named "hello"
    }

    @GetMapping("/api")
    @ResponseBody
    public String api() {
        return "This is JSON or plain text";
    }
}

@RestController




Used for: RESTful web services (APIs).
Returns: Automatically returns JSON or XML responses.
Behavior: It is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody. So every method returns the body directly, not a view.
Example:
@RestController
public class MyRestController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, REST!";  // returns as JSON or plain text
    }
}




Feature
@Controller
@RestController




Returns View?
Yes (by default)
No


JSON/XML by default?
No (@ResponseBody needed)
Yes


Use case
Web UI applications
REST APIs


Combines with
@ResponseBody
Already includes @ResponseBody]]></summary>

What if your SaaS application could detect a cyberattack, recover from it, and keep running — without human help?
In this post, I’ll walk you through building a self-healing SaaS architecture using Django + Frappe, combining security automation, error detection, and real-time remediation — all in one stack.
Traditional SaaS platforms rely on:
Manual monitoring
Reactive fixes
Delayed recovery
In a world of zero-day threats and real-time exploits, this isn't enough.
A self-healing SaaS:

✅ Blocks malicious behavior

✅ Automatically restores services

✅ Notifies only when necessary  



Component
Purpose




Django
Core backend & API logic


Frappe
Metadata-based UI, DocTypes, and permissions


Celery + Redis
Background async healing tasks


Fail2Ban / UFW
Auto-blocking IP threats


Middleware
Attack detection & real-time interception


Audit Logs
Track incidents & healing cycles



Brute Force Login Attack



Middleware detects 5+ login failures from same IP

Stores event in logs

Triggers healing Celery task

Automatically:


Blocks IP via Fail2Ban/UFW

Restarts login module if crashed

Sends healing status alert
⏱️ Total recovery time: < 3 seconds

👤 Human involvement: 0
🔐 Auto-heal authentication abuse

🚫 IP blocking on attack detection

🧰 Restart crashed worker queues (Celery)

🔄 Fix broken DocType workflows

📈 Live dashboards for threat metrics







  
  
  💡 Key Takeaways



Self-healing is not just a trend, it's the future of cyber-resilient platforms.
Django + Frappe offer the perfect balance of flexibility, automation, and observability.
You’re not just building features—you’re building defense mechanisms into the fabric of your product.

A streaming platform wants to stream sport matches commented in English (of course completely legal) for Vietnamese viewers. They demand that the subtitle needed to be translated to Vietnamese with the lowest latency as possible. This blog is a PoC (Proof of Concept) for the translated streaming subtitle, using AWS Transcribe to transcribe the voice to text, Nova Micro to fix the text and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock to translate, with the support of serverless AWS ECS Fargate and Lambda.
Why not using Amazon Translate but use Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock? It is because the streaming videos are in special contexts, using sports vocabulary such as player names, item names which makes AWS Translate cannot identify and translate correctly.

Hayes doubts any government announcing print money plans for Bitcoin 
“The United States is a deficit country; the only way they can do a Strategic Reserve is not sell the Bitcoin they took from people, fine, that’s 200,000 Bitcoin,” he said.

Como fazer:
Use o método getConstructor(...) para obter o construtor desejado.
Em seguida, chame getParameters() para obter um array de Parameter.
Use getName() para acessar o nome de cada parâmetro.
Importante!
Por padrão, os nomes exibidos serão genéricos (arg0, arg1).
Para ver os nomes reais, é necessário compilar o código com a flag:




-parameters


Exemplo com flag:
javac -parameters Usuario.java


Sem essa flag:
Antes do Java 8:
Dependia de bibliotecas externas, como o Paranamer:
Paranamer paranamer = new CachingParanamer();
String[] parameterNames = paranamer.lookupParameterNames(constructor);


Vantagens da nova abordagem:
Evita dependências externas.
Facilita o uso de reflection de forma mais limpa e segura.
🛠️ Como compilar com a flag -parameters:
javac -parameters Usuario.java ReflectionTeste.java


E depois execute:
java ReflectionTeste


🧾 Saída esperada (com -parameters):
true: nome
true: pontos


🔁 Saída sem a flag -parameters:
false: arg0
false: arg1


💡 Importante: Para que os nomes reais dos parâmetros apareçam (nome, pontos), compile com a flag -parameters.

With Crew AI, teams are spinning up agents that:
Launch predictive marketing campaigns
Automate financial back-office ops
Optimize inventory and logistics
And tackle 100+ other enterprise use cases
But here’s the catch: agents are only as good as the data they can reach. That’s where SWIRL comes in.

By pairing Crew AI with SWIRL, you get more than just agents—you get enterprise-ready, data-rich workflows that scale. No custom plumbing. No brittle integrations.
With Crew AI + SWIRL, your agents can:
Connect to 100+ enterprise data sources out-of-the-box
Fetch the most relevant structured/unstructured data across silos
Respect row-level permissions with real enterprise auth
Summarize and answer with your LLM of choice
Plug in easily via zero-code connectors

I spent the week running through various LocalStack Pro sample apps to make sure everything worked as expected. What I didn’t expect was to get hands-on with a whole bunch of AWS services I’ve barely touched before (and a few I had honestly never even heard of).
SageMaker → Machine learning workflows


RDS → Managed relational databases


Neptune → Graph databases


Step Functions → Orchestration workflows


Glue → Data catalog and ETL


MQ → Managed message brokers


Route 53 → DNS and traffic routing



...plus the usual mix of storage, compute, and API Gateway goodness.
What stood out this week was how much you can learn just by doing. I didn’t plan to dive into graph databases or message brokers, but while debugging and tinkering, I picked up quite a bit.
Having everything local with LocalStack definitely made that exploration easier and less intimidating.
First things first: I need to finish my Meme App (priorities are priorities).
Once that’s wrapped, I’d like to turn some of this accidental learning into small demos and share tips on how to explore unfamiliar AWS services without the usual stress.
If you’ve ever gone down the AWS rabbit hole and come out the other side with new scars and skills, I’d love to hear your story too. Just hit me up on Twitter or LinkedIn. Catch y'all next week!]]></summary>

Without a clear way to authenticate dynamically, AI agents either hit brittle, hardcoded APIs or introduce serious security gaps. That’s why authorization has been one of the biggest missing pieces in the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
When MCP was first introduced, it focused on helping AI agents interact with APIs. But it left out that one critical capability: authorization. For the past six months, the MCP team has been working to change that, building a secure, dynamic authorization layer that can keep up with the unpredictable nature of agentic systems.
The new MCP authorization model is based on OAuth 2.1, as expected. But it also adds an important enhancement: supp…]]></summary>

Often, when I'm on discovery calls with potential clients, a common question arises: "Do you think building an app for my business is a good idea?" My response can sometimes be neutral—or even disappointing—but there's an essential reason for that honesty.
Statistically speaking, about 90% of SaaS (Software as a Service) startups fail. This fact isn't meant to discourage entrepreneurs but to inject a necessary dose of realism. As a software developer, I notice that of all the apps installed on my phone or computer, roughly 90% rarely get opened after the initial installation. Sure, some might be used weekly, like social media apps or games, but only a few become daily essentials. Think about your usage: development tools (Xcode, VS Code), browsers (…]]></summary>

Even with Terraform and Ansible, subtle differences sneak in—especially after a few hotfixes. We had OpenSSL versions drift apart, and legacy clients couldn’t connect after a switch. Version control your infra and regularly diff live configs.

According to a May 2 CNBC report, Lummis said the idea that the US president was offering exclusive access to himself and the White House for people willing to pay for it “gives [her] pause.” She wasn’t the only member of the Republican Party to be critical of Trump’s memecoin perks, announced on April 23, roughly three months after the then-president-elect launched the TRUMP token.  
“I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to charge people to come into the Capitol and take a tour,” said Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, according to NBC News.

Did you know the last commercial computer using 9-bit bytes was shut down only 30 years ago? That was the PDP-10—still running when C was dominant, C++ was just emerging (but not yet standardized), Java hadn’t launched (just one year before its release), and Python was still in development (two years before version 1.0).
That kind of diversity hasn’t gone away—it’s just shifted. Today:
There are 35+ active CPU architecture families: x86/64, Arm, MIPS, RISC-V, Xtensa, TriCore, SPARC, PIC, AVR, and many more

Some use unusual instruction widths (e.g., 13-bit for Padauk’s $0.03 MCU)

In this article, I’ll walk you through how to do just that—without sacrificing quality, security, or credibility.
If you're building a cryptocurrency on a budget, the Ethereum blockchain is a great starting point. More specifically, the ERC-20 token standard lets you launch a new token by simply writing and deploying a smart contract.
You don’t need to build your own blockchain, manage nodes, or run any servers. Instead, you leverage the security and reliability of Ethereum’s existing infrastructure.

LinkedIn 
This article will only cover VS code extensions that helped me during development. Some of these tools were introduced to me by a friend of mine. You can search for them in the VS extension marketplace 👍
It integrates Draw.io into your VScode. Making creating diagrams a lot easier. This tool is useful for creating a mockup design for the frontend of the web application. 
This is probably one of my favorite Git VScode extensions. A really great tool for visualizing your Git repository commits. I use it to track the commits I made. If you are working with another developer, you can see the commits made by each other in different color trees.
This is a tool that has helped me categorise my projects. I have made a lot of projects and they tend to be scattered. This tool helped me organise them into blocks. Clicking on them takes me to the project workspace immediately.
One of my favorite tools in my VScode workspace. This extension allows you to store you previous terminal session. You can create a configuration, these configuration can store a set of terminal commands. This is great for variety of functions, like Dockerization, Database migration, and API testings.
This is probably my favorite tool out of all the extensions. It prevents the need to add a console.log in my JS files. I can see the output clearly in the console. It boosts my productivity a lot , and I recommend it the most.
I hope this article helped with your workspace productivity. 
Happy coding ! 😄]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum’s relative dominance among layer-1 (L1) blockchain networks has declined, resulting in an “open race” to become the leading Web3 platform, according to Alex Svanevik, CEO of data service Nansen.
“If you’d asked me 3–4 years ago whether Ethereum would dominate crypto, I’d have said yes,” Svanevik said during a panel discussion at the LONGITUDE by Cointelegraph event. “But now, it’s clear that’s not what’s happening.”
Ethereum is still the most popular L1 network. According to data from DefiLlama, its roughly $52 billion in total value locked (TVL) represents 51% of cryptocurrency residing on blockchain networks.
However, Ethereum’s dominance has diminished sharply since 2021, when the L1 controlled as much as 96% of aggregate TVL, the data shows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Na parte 1 desta série, vimos como o Module Federation permite compartilhar componentes entre diferentes aplicações sem precisar instalar pacotes ou duplicar código. Agora, vamos dar um passo além: como enviar dados de uma aplicação para outra.
Imagine que você tem dois apps:
🔵 MF Consumer  — quem consome um componente remoto
🟢 MF Provider  — quem disponibiliza esse componente
conforme a imagem abaixo:

Vamos supor que o MF Provider tenha um componente chamado App que precisa exibir os dados de um usuário ( nome e email ). Esses dados vêm diretamente do MF Consumer.
No MF Consumer, tem o seguinte:

MF Consumer
Aqui, criei um objeto user e passei como props para o componente Provider , que está vindo do MF Provider.
No lado do MF Provider , defini o tipo das props ( ProviderProps ) e usei os dados recebidos normalmente, como faríamos em qualquer componente React, como segue:

MF Provider
Não é magia. É só React com Module Federation! Ao consumir um componente remoto, você ainda pode passar props normalmente, como se ele fosse local. Isso funciona porque, por baixo dos panos, o Webpack cuida de toda a importação remota — mas o React continua funcionando do jeito que a gente conhece.
Com isso, conseguimos:
Importar um componente remoto com Module Federation
Passar dados para esse componente via props
Exibir esses dados no MF Provider como se tudo estivesse rodando no mesmo app
Acompanhe AQUI como ficou o resultado final.
No próximo artigo, vou mostrar como esse padrão pode ser estendido para eventos e callbacks entre MF Consumer e MF Provider (ex: o usuário clica em algo no Provider e o Consumer reage).
💬 Curtiu? Me conta nos comentários como você está usando MF ou se está considerando aplicar na sua stack.

Granted, it does come bundled with Node pre-installed, but if you want to use your PHP backend with a TypeScript frontend, it requires a tiny bit of configuration. This is what this article is about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No meu artigo anterior, mostrei como montei um projeto com Micro Frontends usando Rsbuild, Module Federation, pnpm e Lerna , tudo rodando num monorepo. Agora, quero dar um passo além e explicar o “porquê” dessa escolha.
É uma forma de compartilhar código entre diferentes aplicações em tempo de execução. Funciona como se um app pudesse importar um componente diretamente do outro — sem instalar, copiar ou duplicar código.
Exemplo real no meu repositório:
📦 mf_provider(chamo de componente filho): expõe um componente Button
📦 mf_consumer_(_chamo de componente pai): consome esse mesmo Header, remotamente, sem precisar tê-lo no código local
✅ Evita reescrever os mesmos componentes em diferentes apps (pelo menos tenta)
✅ Permite deploys independentes (independência de times)
✅ Melhora a escalabilidade de grandes projetos
✅ Facilita refatorações e testes A/B isolados
✅ Acelera o desenvolvimento com reuso real de UI e lógica
“Você não precisa de Micro Frontends… até precisar.”
Nem todo projeto precisa disso.
🔸 Se o projeto é pequeno e centralizado, pode ser complexidade desnecessária
🔸 Se as equipes compartilham tudo e fazem deploy juntos, MF talvez seja overkill
🔸 Se o bundle não é um problema, pode usar libs compartilhadas internas

"This is a big signal. When a city like Cannes, known globally for culture and commerce, starts integrating crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 payments aren’t just a niche thing anymore. It’s about proving that crypto can work in everyday settings, not just online or in theory."

Here's a deep dive into what it is, why you'd use it, and a step-by-step guide to implementing it in Express.
1.Separation of Concerns
Versioning in headers keeps your URL space clean - clients still call /users instead of /v1/users or /v2/users.
2.Content Negotiation
HTTP was designed around content negotiation. You can leverage the Accept header or a custom header (e.g. X-API-Version) to tell your server which variant of the response to emit.
3.Granular Control
You can version on a per-resource or even per-field basis depending on header values.

Nos últimos dias, mergulhei em um experimento que pode facilitar (e muito!) a vida de quem trabalha com micro frontends no dia a dia.
🎯 Criei um repositório open source usando:
Rsbuild (alternativa moderna e rápida ao Webpack)
Module Federation para isolar e compartilhar componentes entre apps
pnpm + Lerna pra orquestrar tudo de forma leve e organizada
📂 Estrutura simples, mas poderosa:
apps/mf_provider: expõe componentes
apps/mf_consumer: consome via Module Federation
Tudo rodando em paralelo com pnpm dev
🔗 Confere lá e, se curtir, arrocha um like ou manda feedback!
Repositório no Github
O pnpm tem um recurso bem legal chamado Catalogs. Ele serve para definir versões de dependências como constantes, que podem ser reutilizadas nos módulos internos dentro do package.json de cada projeto.
Exemplo:
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
# Define a catalog of version ranges.
catalog:
  react: "^18.3.1"
  react-dom: "^18.3.1"

# Nos módulos internos, consigo reutilizar a versão definida no pnpm-workspace.yaml
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "catalog",
    "react-dom": "catalog"
  }

Outra curiosidade bem legal é a praticidade que o Lerna oferece na criação de um monorepo, permitindo executar vários apps juntos de forma paralela com um único comando, como no exemplo abaixo:
"dev": "lerna run --parallel dev",

Rsbuild + Module Federation se mostrou extremamente simples de estruturar e entender, especialmente se comparado ao uso do plugin com Webpack. No próximo artigo, trarei um exemplo utilizando Vite para termos uma ideia prática.
Até mais.

In the growing creator economy, YouTube channels pump out tons of videos every week. and Creators need a simple dashboard that answers the following questions:
How has my channel grown over time?
What is the best day and time to post a video?
What are the most engaging videos in my channel?
To tackle this, I built an end-to-end data pipeline that automatically pulls, processes, and visualizes YouTube data.
In this article goes over the steps I took to archieve this.
Instead of using Docker,I installed everything natively because it gave me more control, better performance tuning, and more flexibility compared to containerized environments.
Apache Airflow schedules and manages all the ETL jobs automatically.

As data volumes increase and workflows grow more interconnected, the ability to build scalable data pipelines becomes essential.

Analyst predicts a low VIX (

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score below 18 implied a “risk-on” environment, favoring assets like Bitcoin. 
Peterson’s model, which had a 95% tracking accuracy, predicted a $135,000 target within the next 100 days if the VIX remains low. This aligns with Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, as a low VIX reduces uncertainty, encouraging investment in ri…]]></summary>

The fintech revolution is coming, and at its core lies one of the most underrated innovations of our time — the blockchain ledger. This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies or buzzwords. It’s about the raw cryptographic power that makes trustless, decentralized finance possible.
Welcome to Episode 1 of our new video series breaking down the XRP Ledger (XRPL) — one concept at a time.
🎥 Watch on YouTube
In this episode, we dive into the two cryptographic pillars behind the XRPL and modern blockchain systems:
Hashing: Immutable fingerprints for any data
Encryption: Protecting the integrity and privacy of transactions
Why Hashing ≠ Encryption (and why that matters)
How the XRPL uses these concepts under the hood
Whether you're new to Web3 or building on XRPL, these are tools you must understand.
Most developers know what a hash function is. Fewer understand why it's critical in blockchain consensus, how it supports immutability, or how encryption standards impact financial systems at scale.
This series will bridge that gap — starting here.
SHA-256
Public/Private Key Encryption
XRP Ledger’s core protocol
Blockchain developers
Fintech engineers
XRPL builders
Anyone curious about real-world cryptography in action






📢 Follow the series — we’ll be breaking down the XRPL layer by layer, from consensus algorithms to smart contract integration (Hooks), and more.
➡️ Drop your thoughts or questions below — and let’s build the future of finance, together.

The nodes mostly comprise human users who provide data in exchange for rewards via the network’s mobile application, COIN. “The vast majority of our 10 million nodes are mobile users, but some are IoT devices like smart speakers,” Levin told Cointelegraph. 
Approximately 80% of XYO’s users are non-crypto natives who are participating in Web3 for the first time, he added.
They include truckers, rideshare drivers, delivery people, and nurses among others, Levin said, adding that “95% convert after onboarding through the COIN app.”

We wrote docs assuming someone would read them. We wrapped our endpoints in auth flows and user interfaces. We expected a person, or maybe a service, on the other side.
But that’s already changing.
AI models are now consuming APIs directly. Not as passive data readers, but as active participants. They parse user intent, synthesize context, and trigger backend actions. They're not just clients. They're intermediaries.
And that changes everything.
When models call APIs, natural language stops being enough.
We like to imagine that models “understand” prompts, but in practice, they just compute probabilities over sequences of text. They don’t grasp nuance the way humans do. A tiny shift in phrasing can derail the whole interaction.

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Mongoose and TypeScript, two helper types make your life much easier:
/**
 * Extracts the “plain” shape of your schema—
 * just the fields you defined, without Mongoose’s built-in methods or `_id`.
 */
export type User = InferSchemaType<typeof userSchema>;

/**
 * Represents a fully “hydrated” Mongoose document:
 * your fields plus all of Mongoose’s methods and metadata
 * (e.g. `_id`, `save()`, `populate()`, etc.).
 */
export type UserDocument = HydratedDocument<User>;

export const userModel = model<UserDocument>("user", userSchema);

InferSchemaType


• Produces a pure TypeScript type from your schema definition.
• Use it whenever you need just the data shape (e.g. DTOs, service inputs/outputs).
HydratedDocument


• Wraps your base type T with Mongoose’s document helpers.
• Use it for any function that deals with real, database-backed 
For example, in a repository interface you might write:
export interface IUserRepository {
  findOneByEmail(email: string): Promise<UserDocument>;
  findById(id: Types.ObjectId): Promise<UserDocument>;
  create(
    createUserDto: Pick<CreateUserDto, 'email' | 'password'>,
  ): Promise<UserDocument>;
}

Here, each method clearly promises a “live” Mongoose document (with built-in methods) while elsewhere you can rely on User for pure data shapes—keeping your boundaries and types crystal clear.

In contrast to batch processing, where data is collected and processed in chunks, streaming data processing deals with data in motion. Instead of waiting for data to accumulate before running transformations, streaming pipelines ingest and process each piece of data as it arrives.

An ML project to empower smarter agriculture decisions
GitHub Repo →
Agriculture remains the backbone of the Indian economy, yet farmers still face unpredictable yields due to varying environmental and input conditions. To tackle this issue, I built a machine learning model that predicts crop yield based on historical and input-based features.
This project is simple, beginner-friendly, and practical.
"How can we accurately predict crop yield based on inputs like rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide use?"
Farmers often rely on experience or guesswork. This model helps bring data-driven decision-making to the field.
The dataset includes:
Area
Production
Crop Year
Rainfall
Fertilizer
Pesticide
📌 Categorical features are label-encoded for model compatibility.
Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (optional for plots)
I trained and evaluated three regression models:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor ✅ Best performer



  
  
  Evaluation Metrics:



R² Score
Adjusted R²
RMSE
Gradient Boosting gave the highest R² score on the test set and was chosen as the final model.
The script allows users to input values for the features and get instant yield predictions.
Clone the repo and run the script locally:
git clone https://github.com/h4ck3r0/crop-yielding-prediction
cd crop-yielding-prediction
python main.py

Add UI with Streamlit or Flask
Integrate with real-time weather APIs
Visual analytics for predictions
This is a practical application of ML in solving a real-world agricultural problem.

The enemy selects two sets of messages (for example, two lists).


One of them is encrypted, and the enemy is trying to guess which one it is.

Once data has been ingested into your system, the next step is to prepare it for actual use. This typically involves cleaning, transforming, and storing the data in a way that supports analysis, reporting, or further processing. This is where data pipelines come in, and at the center of pipeline design are two common strategies: ETL and ELT.
Although they may look similar at first glance, ETL and ELT represent fundamentally different approaches to handling data transformation…]]></summary>

Using AI to Generate Seed Data for Supabase
Every developer knows the importance of having good seed data for fast testing and development. Manually crafting SQL queries to populate your database with realistic data can be tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex relationships between tables.
SupaSeeder connects to your Supabase instance, extracts the database schema, then you can either generate SQL insert statements or optimized prompts to use with any AI model to generate the seed data you need.
supaseeder.vercel.app 🔥



  
  
  ⚙️ How It Works




Provide Supabase URL & Anon Key

Connects to your database and reads the schema.


Write a prompt

Describe the data you want (e.g. "10 users with 5 posts each").


Pick mode





Prompt Mode: Get optimized prompts to use with any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
Direct Mode: Get complete SQL queries generated using OpenAI
Get SQL output
Copy & paste to your SQL editor or Supabase SQL Runner.
Clone the repository:




   git clone https://github.com/mmvergara/supaseeder.git
   cd supaseeder

Install dependencies:




   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install

Start the development server:




   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev]]></summary>

The controlnet-1.1-x-realistic-vision-v2.0 model is a powerful AI tool created by Usama Ehsan that combines several advanced techniques to generate high-quality, realistic images. It builds upon the ControlNet and Realistic Vision models, incorporating techniques like multi-ControlNet, single-ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and consistency-decoder to produce remarkably realistic and visually stunning outputs.
The controlnet-1.1-x-realistic-vision-v2.0 model takes a variety of inputs, including an image, a prompt, and various parameters to fine-tune the generation process. The output is a high-quality, realistic image that aligns with the provided prompt and input image.
Image: The input image that serves as a reference or starting point for the generation process.
Prompt: A text description that guides the model in generating the desired image.
Seed: A numerical value that can be used to randomize the generation process.
Steps: The number of inference steps to be taken during the generation process.
Strength: The strength or weight of the control signal, which determines how much the model should focus on the input image.
Max Width/Height: The maximum dimensions of the generated image.
Guidance Scale: A parameter that controls the balance between the input prompt and the control signal.
Negative Prompt: A text description that specifies elements to be avoided in the generated image.
Output Image: The generated, high-quality, realistic image that aligns with the provided prompt and input image.

Two of the most common messaging patterns are queues and topics. While they might sound similar, their behavior and use cases are quite different.
In this post, I’ll explain what they are, how they differ, and when to use each one.
A queue follows a point-to-point communication model: messages are sent by a producer and consumed by only one consumer. Once a message is processed, it is removed from the queue.
Key characteristics:
Each message is processed by one and only one consumer.
Guarantees single delivery of each message.

Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.
Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Spring Boot and JPA, understanding how transactions and the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() operation interact can make or break your application's data consistency and performance. Yet, I often see even experienced developers overlook the nuances!
Many believe that committing a transaction is the only way to persist changes to the database. However, the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() method forces the persistence context to synchronize with the underlying database immediately-without ending the transaction. This can be a game-changer for scenarios where you need to validate constraints or trigger database actions before the transaction completes.
But here’s the catch: improper use of 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() can lead to unexpected behaviors, performance overhead, or even data inconsistencies if not handled carefully. It's crucial to know when and why to use it, especially in complex microservices or batch processing environments.
How do you approach transaction management and flushing in your Spring Boot projects? Have you ever faced a tricky bug or performance issue related to this? Share your experience or tips in the comments-let’s learn from each other!

Dependency Injection (DI) is one of the most debated design patterns in software development. While opinions vary on whether it’s universally beneficial, one thing is certain: DI can be extremely useful if not treated as a "golden hammer." Overusing it, such as blindly injecting every dependency, can lead to unnecessary complexity rather than cleaner code.
In this article, we’ll explore how DI can be effectively applied in Next.js, striking the right balance between maintainability and simplicity.

Hello friends, SQL (Structured Query Language) is one of the most essential skills for any Software Engineer. I would rate this skill as similar to system design and coding. 
If you are a professional programmer, it doesn't matter whether you are a Java, Golang, or .NET developer; you are bound to write SQL queries. 
Since the database is an integral part of any modern Java or Web application, the Interviewer always preferred candidates with excellent SQL skills. 
Now, the big question comes: How can a programmer learn SQL? Is knowing how to query a table enough? If you remember insert, update, delete, and select, then are you a…]]></summary>

I'm just a fellow programmer like many of you, and I've been thinking about a real-world problem that we, as developers and makers, can work together to solve. I've already outlined the idea and prepared a detailed walkthrough for the project. A very basic prototype ready- though it's still in its early stages.
I'm now looking to form a passionate team of developers, programmers, and 3D designers to bring this idea to life. If you're someone who’s interested in solving meaningful problems and building something impactful, I’d love to have you onboard!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vector search is becoming a core workload for AI-driven applications. But do you really need to introduce a new system just to handle it?
We ran a performancebenchmark to find out: comparing PostgreSQL (using pgvector + pgvectorscale) with Qdrant on 50 million embeddings.
Sub-100ms query latencies
471 queries per second (QPS) on Postgres—11x higher throughput than Qdrant (41 QPS)
Head to the full write-up for a deep dive into our vector database comparison.

At 99% recall, Postgres delivers sub-100ms query latencies and handles 11x more query throughput than Qdrant (471 QPS vs. Qdrant’s 41 QPS).
The results show that thanks to pgvectorscale, Postgres can keep up with specialized vector databases and deliver as good, if not better performance at scale. Learn more about why Postgres wins for AI and vector workloads.
How? We built pgvectorscale to push Postgres to its limits for vector workloads—without compromising recall, latency, or cost-efficiency. It turns your favorite relational database into a high-performance vector search engine.
✅ No extra systems.
✅ No new query languages.
✅ Just Postgres.
We used RTABench to run a transparent, reproducible evaluation—designed for real-world, high-scale workloads.
Curious about the architecture behind it all?
👉 Read our whitepaper on building Timescale for real-time and AI workloads
It dives into how we engineered Timescale to handle time-series, vector, and relational data—all in one Postgres-native platform.
Have you used Postgres or Qdrant for vector search?

DevOps, as the name suggests, combines Development and Operations into a unified approach. A DevOps Engineer orchestrates the entire journey of an application: planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying, and monitoring. This comprehensive process ensures applications work seamlessly for end-users and integrate properly with other services.
I see DevOps Engineers as master planners who understand the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Success in this role requires both technical expertise and strong communication skills. Communication becomes crucial especially when coordinating across different teams – from developers to stakeholders.

So this post was inspired by that conversation, and I hope it helps anyone else who is looking to try it out.  In a previous post I introduced how Amazon Q CLI now supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) (check out Configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Amazon Q CLI for more details). 
This post will build on that and show you how to run MCP Servers via container images. As I switched to using Finch from Docker back in 2024, I will be using that - this means if you are using something different to Docker, like Podman for example, you should be able to follow along and use that tool too.

After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.
The firm’s shift to a Bitcoin-only approach comes as ETH has lost 45% of its value year-to-date, with some optimists speculating that ETH is potentially close to the bottom and reversing its negative trend soon.

HTTP is the foundation of everything we build and interact with on the web — whether it’s a static website, a complex Single Page Application (SPA), a RESTful API, or a modern mobile app.
Every user action that triggers data exchange — from submitting a login form to loading an image — ultimately depends on HTTP.
Despite this, many developers treat HTTP as a black box: something that “just works” behind the scenes. While abstraction is useful, serious web developers must move beyond it.
Understanding how HTTP actually operates — from how requests are structured, to how connections are established, to how responses are transmitted — is essential for building high-quality, secure, and performant applications.

Welcome to the third peer review series for DataTalks Club Data Engineering Zoomcamp. In this post, I’ll be dissecting a real-world data engineering project that analyzes the French Data Engineering job market. The goal? To break down the project’s infrastructure, orchestration, and cloud design—spotlighting what works well, what could be improved, and, most importantly, what we can all learn as practicing data engineers.
Why do this? Because reviewing and sharing feedback on real-world projects sharpens our own skills, encourages open knowledge sharing, and helps us all grow together. Let’s dig in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world of online dating has changed dramatically in the past few years — and artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a major role in that transformation. One emerging trend is AI dating pictures: profile photos generated or enhanced by AI to help users present their “best selves” on dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, or even social media platforms.
But what exactly are AI dating pictures, and are they a good idea? Let’s break it down.
AI dating pictures refer to profile photos that are either:
✅ Generated entirely by AI — using tools like AI portrait generators or avatars based on your real face.
✅** Enhanced or edited by AI** — improving lighting, removing blemishes, sharpening features, or even subtly reshaping facial features.
These photos aim to make you look more appealing wit…]]></summary>

Multi currency, aka exchange rate management
Time-zone management
Ages have passed, but those topics keep staying in the top 5 chart of my headaches-giver topics.
Just today, scrolling in my LinkedIn wall, I've found an interesting article from Nick Doelman that pointed to another article from 2021 where he solved the long-standing issue of updating exchange rates in the platform in an way that is
straightforward
elegant
deterministic
fast to set-up
and, above all, free!
It's just a matter of leveraging the right tools, that in this case are:
https://exchangeratesapi.io/: a website that provides daily updated exchange rates with a compelling licensing model that allows up to 100 api calls per month for free!
a simple Power Automate flow.
Take a look at his article for details!

This was in the early 20-teens, and the buzzword floating everywhere was “Fullstack Developer.” YouTube was overflowing with success stories, “I went from zero to six figures in a year,” “How I became a Fullstack developer without a CS degree.” It was intoxicating.

According to a May 2 Financial Times report, the ban on borrowing to fund crypto purchases is one of the upcoming crypto rules by the FCA. David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, told the FT that “crypto is an area of potential growth for the UK, but it has to be done right.” He added:
“To do that we have to provide an appropriate level of protection.”
Geale denied claims that the FCA is hostile to the crypto industry. Instead, he explained that he views the industry as offering high-risk investments with less consumer protection. “We are open for business,“ he said.

Kepler is a monitoring and observability tool designed for Kubernetes clusters that uses eBPF to track the resource usage of containers and nodes. Unlike traditional monitoring solutions, which often rely on metrics collection agents running in user space, Kepler utilizes eBPF to gather resource consumption data directly from the kernel. This results in high precision and low overhead, which is essential for cloud-native environments.
Kepler is particularly useful for:

You might be laughing a bit here. Of course .json and js goes hand in hand. Since the beginning of time we have used .json files to throw in config, mock data or see how many levels of data-indentation we can reach before we go crazy.
Well, what I want to do is have a data.json file where I "mock" all the data I want/need for a page so:
In practise this means I can simply import my file, and since I am not crazy and love using TypeScript, I can also type my data:

Asked about his tariff program, the president remarked, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.’”
But the toy stores where those dolls are sold might have something to say about it. 
Earlier in the week, Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota joined a growing number of American small businesses suing the president over his emergency tariff plan.

  1️⃣ Imagine a Pizza Menu 🍕


You walk into a pizza place and see a menu. The menu promises what pizzas they offer—but doesn’t make them yet.

An interface in Java is like that menu: it defines what a class should do, but not how!  
The menu says:  
"All pizzas must have cheese 🧀"

"All pizzas must be bakeable 🔥"
Any chef (class) who follows this menu must fulfill these rules! In Java, we call this "implementing an interface."







  
  
  3️⃣ Multiple Menus, One Chef!


A chef can follow multiple menus (interfaces):  
Italian food menu 🍝

Fast food menu 🍔
Similarly, a Java class can implement many interfaces at once! (Unlike inheritance, where you only get one parent.)







  
  
  4️⃣ But… What If the Chef Cheats? 😱


If a chef says, "I’ll follow the pizza menu!" but doesn’t add cheese… BIG PROBLEM!

Java won’t allow this—it forces the class to implement every method in the interface, or the code won’t compile!  
What if some pizzas usually have tomato sauce, but not always?

Interfaces can now provide default methods—like a "standard recipe" that chefs can override if they want!  

java
interface Pizza {  
    default void addSauce() { System.out.println("Adding tomato sauce!"); }  
}]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From this article 2 Minute Tips: The Dark Secret of Optionals I got to know that the Optionals are nothing but an Enum . I started experimenting: How can we build Optional from scratch
You might have heard of Schrödinger’s Cat — the thought experiment where a cat in a box is both alive and dead until you check. That's basically an Optional, right? A value that might exist... or not.
So, let's turn this idea into code:
enum 📦<Value> {
    case 😺(Value)
    case 😵

    init(_ from: Value) {
        self = .😺(from)
    }
}

Now we can do:
let x: 📦 = .😺(123)
let y: 📦 = .😵

But that's not quite as convenient as Swift's native syntax: let x: Int? = 123.
Can we make ours feel just as nice?
Swift lets types conform to ExpressibleByNilLiteral. Let’s do that:

Have you ever paused to wonder what really happens when you book a movie ticket online? What unfolds behind the scenes when you check show details or reserve your favorite seat? I’ve always been fascinated by the complexity beneath that simple click-and building SkyFox Cinema gave me the perfect opportunity to explore it firsthand.
SkyFox Cinema is a modern, full stack movie booking platform designed to help regional theaters embrace digital transformation.

Specifically, ARP is used to map an IP address (logical address) to a MAC address (physical address), which is necessary for data transmission at the data link layer.
ARP is a Layer 2 protocol used in IPv4 networks to map a known IP address to its corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) address. While IP addresses help devices find each other logically, MAC addresses are what Ethernet networks use to actually deliver packets. ARP acts as the translator between these two.
IP works at Layer 3 (Network Layer) but to actually send data over Ethernet (Layer 2), the system needs the MAC address of the destination device.

O Facade é um padrão de projeto do tipo estrutural. Ele consiste na criação de uma classe intermediária (ou fachada) que expõe uma interface simplificada para um conjunto de classes ou processos mais complexos.
Seu principal objetivo é desacoplar a lógica de negócios da complexidade de múltiplas instâncias e chamadas internas, permitindo que outras partes do sistema interajam com uma interface unificada e mais limpa. Isso melhora a organização do código, facilita a manutenção e reduz a dependência direta de implementações internas.

In this guide, we'll explore effective techniques for intercepting and blocking unwanted network requests in Puppeteer.
Blocking unnecessary requests offers several benefits:
Faster page loading - Skipping images, analytics, and ads can dramatically reduce load times
Reduced bandwidth usage - Especially important for cloud-based scraping or serverless functions
Lower memory consumption - Fewer resources to process means less memory used
Improved stability - Fewer network requests means fewer potential points of failure

Originally posted : https://lexingtonthemes.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-typography-component-with-variants-with-astro-js-and-tailwind-css/
Why do we need a typography component?
Consistent typography is key to keeping your website looking clean and organized. Without it, things can start to look messy fast. A typography component helps keep text styling uniform across your whole site. The idea here is to make it both flexible and well-defined, so you get a good balance between structure and creativity, since not everything is just black and white. ‘]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to part 4 in the series of shell scripting. Today we will look at a script that goes through an array with complex values. Complex values such as spaces, apostrophes, and quotes.
Scripting is the process of writing a set of instructions in a programming or scripting language to automate tasks that would otherwise be done manually. In the context of shell scripting, these instructions are written for the command-line shell, allowing users to perform complex operations - like file management, backups, or software installations - with just a single script execution. It's a powerful tool for saving time and ensuring consistency in system administration and development workflows


Create the script in VIM, complex_list.sh



Write and save the script in VIM.



We can check whether it has been created  by doing ls -ltrh.



Give the permission so the script can be executed.



If we then do a ls –ltrh we can see the script has gained a green colour, meaning that it is now executable.



Output after executing the script by using the command ./




  
  
  Stay tuned, part 5 in the series coming tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excelorithm, we build custom software solutions for startups, SMEs, and enterprise clients alike. And as the technical head here, I’ve seen a recurring pain point — many teams, including our own, spend way too much time setting up the basics of a SaaS product: authentication, subscriptions, dashboards, role management, notifications...
Sure, there are tons of SaaS starter kits out there, both free and premium. They promise speed — and often deliver — but usually at a hidden cost: vendor lock-in.
Many popular boilerplates rely on proprietary services, paid APIs, or tightly coupled ecosystems. That might be fine early on, but over time it limits your freedom, raises your costs, and ties you to someone else’s roadmap.
That’s why we built SaaSLaunchpad — a free, open-source Next.js SaaS starter kit with zero paid tool dependencies and no vendor lock-in.

Anyone who has used traditional payment systems will likely be familiar with refunds and chargebacks. If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.
However, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.

Bitcoin long-term holders are about to hit a level of unrealized profit, which has traditionally caused them to sell.

That level coincides with the return to a six-figure BTC price.

Order book data suggests that bulls may not succeed in keeping the upside going.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “notable increase” in selling from its older investors if price rises further, warns onchain analytics firm Glassnode.
In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” researchers calculated that long-term holders (LTHs) are sitting on almost 350% unrealized profits.

Fair source software is a licensing model designed to balance the freedom of open source with the revenue potential of proprietary software. This blog post explores the history, core concepts, practical applications, challenges, and future innovations of fair source software. By blending aspects of open access with commercial monetization, fair source software offers an alternative ecosystem where developers can engage communities while earning sustainable revenue. We also compare fair source with traditional licensing models using tables and bullet lists for clarity. Furthermore, we discuss additional facets such as funding strategies and legal complexities that shape this emerging model in the digital landscape.

But exactly is the purpose of the Node Operators in the Catalysis Ecosystem? well let's get into that now.
They power the services (AVSs) by doing important technical tasks.
They also help protect the network by locking up funds (called 
staking)—this keeps them honest.
If they do something wrong, they can lose money so they have a 
strong reason to act fairly.
I'm pretty sure at this point you can fairly understand why they are called the backbone of the network. Basically without them nothing would work.
HOW DOES CATALYSIS WORK IN RELATION TO THE NODE OPERATORS?
Normally, running these services on many platforms is complicated and 
expensive.
Catalysis simplifies this by giving them one tool (Catalyst-CLI) 
to manage everything in one place.

Any service that's meant to live more than couple of weeks eventually reaches the stage where you feel the need to properly monitor it. You usually start with simple console.log logging, but soon realize it's not readable enough, it's not searchable enough and it's only available on your server. Probably inside Docker container.
I was exactly at that point, annoyed by constant need to ssh into my server to check one log line. I've wanted to play with Grafana ecosystem for a while, too. So it seemed to be the perfect moment.

When the lines blur between man and machine, you’re looking at artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition.
AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality. 
Yet another strand of prevailing research seeks to explore the feasibility and implications of AG…]]></summary>

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin (BTC) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs. However, that’s since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post.
“Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a gamble mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach,” he said.
“This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains,” Quinlivan added.

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token.
If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled.
Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.”

“What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role quickly turned into an intelligence-gathering operation,” the company wrote in a May 1 blog post.
Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview.
Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used.

There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.
After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

        <updated>2025-05-02T00:43:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By default, Spring Data JPA loads related data lazily, which can cause the N+1 problem — one query for the main data and more for each related item. @EntityGraph annotation fixes this by letting you load related data in a single query, without changing your entity mapping. It’s simple, improves performance, and avoids writing custom JOIN FETCH queries.
Let’s say you have a Post entity that references an Author.
Entities
@Entity
public class Post {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String title;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Author author;
}

@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}

Repository
public interface PostRepository extends JpaRepository<Post, Long> {

    // attributePaths specifies related entities to eagerly load
    @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"author"})
    List<Post> findAll();
}

Now, if you create a simple controller to return all posts and have SQL logging enabled, you'll see the queries printed in the console.
With @EntityGraph, only one query runs to fetch both the post and its author. Without it, multiple queries are executed — one for the posts and one for each author — which is the N+1 problem.
✅ Using @EntityGraph
Only one query — fast and efficient.
select p.id, p.title, a.id, a.name
from post p
left join author a on p.author_id = a.id

🚨 Not Using @EntityGraph
N+1 queries — slow and wasteful.
select * from post;
select * from author where id = ?;
select * from author where id = ?;]]></summary>

O LangGraph é uma extensão do LangChain que permite construir fluxos de execução orientados a grafos para LLMs e agentes. Em vez de seguir uma sequência fixa de passos (como num pipeline tradicional), você define nós (nodes) e arestas (edges) que representam o comportamento dinâmico do sistema.

When working with data structures like lists or NumPy arrays in Python,

the standard print or pprint, or even external tools like rich, often fail to provide a clear view of the entire structure,

especially when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or deeply nested data, making it easy to lose track of which element corresponds to which.
Let's consider the following example as an illustration.
sample = [
    {"user": {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "scores": [95, 88, 76]}},
    {"user": {"id": "002b", "name": "Bob", "scores": [72, 85, 90]}},
    {"bug_user": {"id": [3], "name": "Charlie", "scores": [100, [50, 40], 70]}},
]

 — The “Pitfalls” of Data Structures


Python's lists, dictionaries, and NumPy arrays are fine to work with for simple structures.…]]></summary>

According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets.

According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

Despite weak US manufacturing data, Federal Reserve liquidity plans and strong corporate earnings keep equities and crypto afloat.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March.

Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “decoupling” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment.

In an interview with Cointelegraph's Sam Bourgi at Token2049, Elissar said that stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, the intersection between AI and crypto, alternative use cases such as decentralized science, and Web3 gaming were all niches the company is exploring.
Gaming is "part of our DNA," the executive said before reflecting on the current state of the Web3 gaming industry:

"Every retail user should be thinking about getting at least one Bitcoin — very soon they won’t be able to afford it,” Kunz said. 
If the United States starts buying Bitcoin for a strategic reserve, even smaller countries may soon struggle to acquire the cryptocurrency, he added. "I’m pretty sure we’ll soon see countries battling over who owns more Bitcoin. The US will start.”

Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by August or September of this year if BTC breaks above the parabolic slope pattern. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price jumped to new quarterly highs at $96,700 on May 1, a day after the US GDP contracted -0.3% for the first time since Q2 2022. Amid heightened economic concerns, the probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut rose to 62.8% for the June 18 Federal Reserve meeting. 
Over the past 24 hours, short position liquidations exceeded $137 million, with Alphractal founder Joao Wedson observing that BTC's price momentum continues to favor bullish trends.

He added that projects with effective onchain incentive structures might even “build a better AI because you have this incentive engine that brings in developers,” Nailwal said on May 1.

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, Ardoino reiterated that Tether had no plans to apply for its US dollar-pegged stablecoin USDt — the largest by market capitalization — to be compliant under MiCA in European countries, potentially forcing exchanges to delist the stablecoin. He added that though crypto firms had to follow regulations, there was a “fear of compliance” among companies in the EU.

The decision was shared in a May 1 X post, with Coinbase citing the token’s failure to meet its listing standards. The price of the MOVE token also declined by approximately 14.5% in the last 24 hours. Coinbase specified the details of the suspension in an announcement:
"Trading for MOVE will be suspended on Coinbase, Simple and Advanced Trade, Coinbase Exchange, and Coinbase Prime. We have moved our MOVE order books to limit-only mode. Limit orders can be placed and canceled, and matches may occur."

Ten years ago, the state created the United States’ first comprehensive regulatory framework for firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, including key consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity guidelines.

Bitcoin pressures shorts after 3% daily gains
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $96,955 on Bitstamp, its highest since Feb. 22.
Increasingly close to six figures, Bitcoin rose with US stocks at the Wall Street open as Microsoft gained 10% to become the world’s highest-valued public company.
Reacting, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades suggested that stocks may be on the cusp of a return to sustained bullish trajectory.
“Stocks trade at a key area here,” he wrote in ongoing X analysis.

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

“There’s no standard way for wallets, apps, or protocols to interpret or display this information,” decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem development organization Wonderland wrote in a May 1 X post. Wallets, decentralized applications (DApps), block explorers and smart contracts follow different rules.
“The result? A messy, inconsistent experience that breaks cross-chain UX,“ Wonderland stated.
Wonderland is a group of developers, researchers and data scientists focused on improving the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. The organization partnered with multiple DeFi protocols, including Optimism, Aztec, Connext and Yearn.

“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

According to a May 1 Bloomberg report, the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026.

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates sooner than expected.

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

With the explosion of remote work, IoT devices, and public connectivity, MITM attacks are more relevant than ever. For developers, IT professionals, and security teams, the danger lies in the illusion of secure communication.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.

In React, conditional rendering allows you to dynamically render different UI components based on certain conditions. You can use JavaScript logic such as if statements, the ternary operator (? :), the logical AND (&&), or assign JSX to variables.
Using if Statements


The simplest way to conditionally render components is by using if statements inside a function component.
Example:





function AlertMessage({ show }) {
  if (!show) {
    return null;
  }
  return <p className="alert">This is an alert message!</p>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <AlertMessage show={true} />;
}

In this example, if show is false, the component returns null and nothing is rendered.
Using Ternary Operator (? :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

Have you ever run a SQL query that just took forever and wondered, "Why is this so slow?" You're not alone. Databases are fast until they're not. And one of the simplest, yet most powerful performance tricks in SQL is indexing.
What indexing really means in MySQL 


Why indexes are performance game changers


The exact results of an experiment we ran on 80,000+ records in 


MySQL 5.7 on a local setup (8GB RAM, SSD)


When indexing helps and when it doesn't



Let's dive in.

Think of an index like a book's table of contents. If you need Chapter 8, you don't flip through every single page you jump straight to it. That's what MySQL does with an index.
Primary Index(based on the primary key)
Unique Index (for ensuring uniqueness)

Hello everyone! Welcome to the second entry in my reading journey series. This time I have managed to read only 5 books. While I’m a little bit behind on my Goodreads goal of reading 52 books in the year, the last couple of months have been very busy with the end of the academic winter term. Now that I’m done with classes, I’m sure that I can have more time for reading and hopefully catch up to my goal. Let’s go into the reviews for this entry!

I briefly mentioned in the last entry that I was starting to read a collection of Celtic fairy tales and lore that my dad gifted me for Christmas. The first book in this collection is Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland by Lady Wilde. It contains a varied recollection of folklore and fairy tales.
Overall, I liked…]]></summary>

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

After doing my first job as a frontend engineer in a startup for an year, I left my job. Their are multiple reasons for it, but that was the story of another time.
After that I decided to not pursue the tech career and start my chocolate factory - HAKI, a chocolate spread idea that crossed my mind.


If anyone is thinking, why making a chocolate spread would be so hard, like I thought initially, my 1st two variants caught fungus within a week.

Long time, messaging a hundred people for advice and many failed attempts, now I'm here finally — with the most delicious recipe made using clean, wholesome ingredients to keep it truly healthy.
Ahh and please follow Haki on @eathaki_ to know more about it.

We're still on the lookout for a graphic designer who's excited to help build HAKI — feel free to drop me an email if someone comes to mind.
Thank you so much for reading it till here 😊

Also, if there's a better place to share this, please let me know.]]></summary>

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…]]></summary>

The company also set more favorable chances of approval for other altcoin ETFs, including proposed funds holding XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in an X post. 
The estimates reflect an improved outlook from Bloomberg analysts. In a February analysis, Bloomberg pegged the odds of a Solana (SOL) ETF approval at only 70%. They ascribed a 65% and 75% chance of approval to funds holding XRP and DOGE, respectively.

In an April 30 filing in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), lawyers for Coinbase argued that a First Circuit Court of Appeals decision set a “dangerous precedent” for crypto users, potentially allowing the government to “trace users’ every crypto transaction in the past and monitor every crypto transaction in the future.” The appeal to the Supreme Court stemmed from petitioner James Harper, a Coinbase user, who took legal action against the IRS after the crypto exchange was forced to turn over transaction data to the government using a sweeping “John Doe…]]></summary>

Stablecoins’ cumulative market cap currently stands at roughly $230 billion, but “[e]volving market dynamics [have] the potential to accelerate stablecoins’ trajectory to reach ~$2tn in market cap by 2028,” the Treasury said in the April 30 report. 
A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar. According to the report, such tokens are already “ubiquitously utilized as ‘cash on-chain,’ effectively serving as a new payment mechanism.”

Bitcoin’s price increased by sixfold each time its age increased by 40%.

If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could rally to $351,046 in 2025.

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

Now, Tether is preparing to expand into the US market “by the end of this year or early next year, at the fastest,” Ardoino said, adding that the timing depends on US lawmakers’ progress on stablecoin legislation. 
The stablecoin issuer is working to woo US regulators by proactively collaborating with law enforcement and highlighting USDT’s benefits for the US economy.

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain payments firm Ripple has reportedly bid up to $5 billion in an effort to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle, but the offer was rejected.
According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally.

In an exclusive interview, Markova described the competition with dollar-pegged stablecoins as “all about sovereignty.” She compared the situation to earlier tensions between governments and US payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamic with stablecoins — on a smaller scale for now — but they’re definitely emerging as a new arena for sovereign concerns,” she said.

US GDP shrank -0.3% in Q1, far below +0.3% forecasts, sparking recession fears.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023. Polymarket odds of a recession in 2025 hit 67%, with consumer confidence at its lowest since May 2020.

Speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on April 30, Zhao said that areas of the United Arab Emirates were “extremely pro-business,” leading to crypto adoption in Dubai, while others like Bhutan were building national Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) stockpiles. According to Zhao, the US was pressing other countries’ hands by exploring its own policies for a crypto reserve, but those in Europe didn’t seem to be reacting.
“I don’t see Europe in this discussion,” said Zhao, highlighting one exception. “Montenegro is actually quite pro-crypto. We had an active dialogue with [the] prime minister there, and he’s a very forward-thin…]]></summary>

US GDP shrank in Q1, raising recession alarms while also prompting calls for Fed rate cuts.

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support. 

Today’s crypto derisking is likely transitory; market fundamentals remain strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…]]></summary>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it. 
This is not the first time products have been revealed to be inauthentic, with the Honey Authenticity Network highlighting that one-third of all honey products were fak…]]></summary>

On April 2, Trump levied “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on 185 countries and territories. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,200 points on April 4, while the S&P 500 dropped nearly 6%, its largest decline since March 2020. Bitcoin (BTC) went along for the ride but broke from stocks as it recovered toward the end of the month. 
Blockchain adoption metrics for Ethereum are looking good, as the network now boasts 60% real-world asset (RWA) tokenization value. Major firms like BlackRock are sure the blockchain will be the standard for RWAs, but other observers believe that scaling is…]]></summary>

In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy.
The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…]]></summary>

The DLT shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), the firm said in its April 29 Form N-1A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The money market fund holds over $150 million worth of assets, invested almost entirely in US Treasury bills and cash.
BlackRock said that the shares “are expected to be purchased and held through BNY, which intends to use blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.”

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a modern approach to provisioning cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or OpenTofu. These technologies improve scalability, repeatability, and automation—but they can also introduce security risks if the code is misconfigured. For example, exposing an S3 bucket to the public or disabling encryption can lead to serious data breaches.
This article introduces CoGuard, a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool designed specifically to analyze configuration files used in infrastructure code. We’ll demonstrate how to scan Terraform code, interpret results, and automate the scanning process in a CI/CD workflow.

Firefox is a powerful, free, and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. The journey of Firefox began in **2002, when it was initially launched under the name *“Phoenix”. Due to trademark conflicts, it was later renamed *“Firebird”, and finally, in **2004, it became known as *“Firefox”*.
The main objective was to offer a lightweight, secure, and flexible browser alternative to the then-dominant Internet Explorer. Firefox quickly became popular due to its faster performance, tabbed browsing, and support for third-party **extensions (add-ons).
Over time, Firefox introduced several innovations such as:
Private Browsing Mode
Enhanced Tracking Protection

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, 2025 has ushered in a paradigm shift known as vibe coding. Coined by AI researchers, vibe coding represents a transition from traditional, syntax-heavy programming to a more intuitive, AI-assisted approach where developers articulate their intentions in natural language, and AI tools generate the corresponding code.
At its core, vibe coding is about conveying the desired functionality or behavior of software through conversational prompts. Instead of meticulously writing out code line by line, developers describe what they want the software to do, and AI models translate these descriptions into executable code.

Will AI Take My Job?
Anita Olsen ・ Apr 22
#discuss
        #ai
      
Sure, we code daily and AI shines at spitting out code. But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.
Apart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:
Inter-team planning
Brainstorming sessions
Putting late sprints back on track
Designing requirements and user stories
Decomposing a full project into milestones
Scoping tasks with Product people
Reviewing architecture designs
Negotiating deadlines
Talking to clients
And that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn't surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can't replace that human interaction yet.
But sure, our job as coders will change. Even if we're skeptical about AI, we can't ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us. We have to adapt.
We won't be code monkeys anymore, cracking lines of code in exchange for bananas. AI will handle that. And if AI will change everything, let it at least kill dumb SCRUM ceremonies.

There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals.
The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they’ll be told to “use it or lose it.”

In an April 29 X post, tech commentator Jacob Canfield shared a scam letter sent to his home via post that appeared to be from Ledger claiming he needed to immediately perform a “critical security update” on his device. 
The letter, which uses Ledger’s logo, business address, and a reference number to feign legitimacy, asks to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s private recovery phrase under the guise of validating the device.
The letter threatens that “failure to complete this mandatory validation process may result in restricted access to your wallet and funds.”

Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.

If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.

Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening.

The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours.

Fidelity Digital Assets says Bitcoin is undervalued and the firm holds an optimistic mid-term outlook.

The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. 

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” 
As proof,  the firm cited the ‘Bitcoin Yardstick’ metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network. 
In Q1 2025, the metric stayed between -1 and 3 standard deviations, cooling from its Q4 2024 overheated levels. The number of days above 2-standard deviations dropped from 22 to 15, …]]></summary>

"The strong growth of Bitcoin and of other crypto-assets with high price volatility means risks not only for investors but also potentially for financial stability, given the growing interconnections between the digital asset ecosystem, the traditional financial sector and the real economy,” the report notes.

The US regulator has delayed its deadline for ruling on the proposed ETF listings until June, according to two filings reviewed by Cointelegraph. 
The filings were responses to March requests from US exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX Exchange to list Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and Franklin Templeton’s XRP (XRP) ETF, respectively. 
They came on the same day that Nasdaq, another US exchange, asked for permission to list a 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. 
Dogecoin is the world’s most heavily traded memecoin, with a market capitalization of around $26 billion as of April 29, according to data from CoinGecko. X…]]></summary>

Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals.

In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.

Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors’ inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.

Europe’s second-largest neobank, Bunq, is expanding into cryptocurrency, citing growing retail investor demand for digital assets worldwide.
The Amsterdam-based neobank announced the launch of Bunq Crypto on April 29, a new offering enabling its users to invest in over 300 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL).
Starting April 29, Bunq users in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Belgium will be able to access cryptocurrencies directly through the Bunq app, according to an announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways: 

Fidelity Digital Assets’ report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum's layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.
The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin’s favor.

The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF, shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Polkadot (DOT). 
Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund. The request amounts to a regulatory review process that could determine whether Dogecoin becomes accessible to a broader range of investors through an ETF structure.

In an April 29 notice, the UK government announced draft rules for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), that would bring “crypto exchanges, dealers and agents” in line with regulations, as many residents were “exposed to risky firms and scams.” It cited discussions with US government officials, including a proposed US-UK cross-border sandbox from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Hester Peirce.

AI has been a dominant narrative since 2024, but users and companies still cannot completely trust it. Whether it’s finances, personal data or healthcare decisions, hesitation around AI’s reliability and integrity remains high.
This growing AI trust deficit is now one of the most significant barriers to widespread adoption. Decentralized, privacy-preserving technologies are quickly being recognized as viable solutions that offer verifiability, transparency and stronger data protection without compromising AI’s growth.

Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders (STHs) are back in the game as a “speculative capital” enters the market.
In an X thread on April 29, onchain analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency compliance firm Bitrace found that $649 billion worth of stablecoins flowed through addresses classified as high-risk in 2024, according to an April 29 report.
Bitrace defines high-risk blockchain addresses as those used by illegal entities to receive, transfer or store stablecoins.
Crypto compliance firms typically score crypto wallet addresses based on their likelihood of involvement in illicit activities. The higher the risk, the higher the likelihood of foul play, and the less likely compliant crypto businesses are to accept the assets.
Per the report, the amount accounted for roughly 5.14% of all stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. This is down 0.8% from 5.94% the previous year, but significantly higher than the 2.8% reported in 2022 and 1.63% in 2021.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.
