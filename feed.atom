There are 4 main types of hosting, depending on your needs, budget, and technical skills:
What it is: Multiple websites share the same server and resources.
Best for: Beginners, small websites, blogs.
Pros: Cheap, easy to use.
Cons: Limited performance, less control, security risk from other users.
Examples: Hostinger, Bluehost, GoDaddy, Namecheap
What it is: A physical server divided into virtual servers. You get dedicated resources.
Best for: Developers, small-to-medium apps, testing environments.
Pros: More control, better performance than shared.
Cons: Needs basic sysadmin knowledge (SSH, Linux, Docker).
Examples: DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzner, Vultr
What it is: You get the whole physical server just for your app.
Best for: Large apps, enterprise workloads, high-traffic systems.
Pros: Full control, top performance.
Cons: Expensive, requires advanced knowledge to manage.
Examples: OVH, Liquid Web, IBM Cloud Bare Metal
What it is: On-demand infrastructure with autoscaling, storage, and other services.
Best for: Scalable apps, modern deployments, CI/CD workflows.
Pros: Scales easily, pay-as-you-go, supports containers/microservices.
Cons: Learning curve, can be costly over time if not optimized.
Examples:
Cloud providers: AWS (EC2, ECS, Lightsail), Azure, Google Cloud
PaaS: Render, Railway, Heroku, Vercel (frontend), Netlify (frontend)
Some hosts specialize in Docker/Kubernetes:
For Docker Compose: VPS (DigitalOcean, Hetzner)
For Kubernetes: AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE, or K3s on your VPS

This guide explores how to set up such a system that can integrate JavaScript execution alongside Rust's efficiency while leveraging Deno's secure permission model and web APIs.
Understanding Deno and its Permission Model
Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that offers robust security through permissions. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser-controlled environment with controls over which files and network access is available. This makes it an ideal candidate for implementing a plugin system where different scripts can be executed with varying levels of control.

*My post explains variable assignment in Python.
You can unpack the iterable which has zero or more values to one or more variables as shown below:
*The number of variables must match the number of values unless a variable uses *.
v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1, 2]

v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1]
# ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)

v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1, 2, 3]
# ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)

*The one or more values with one or more commas(,) are a tuple.
v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1, 2]
v1, v2, v3 = range(0, 3)
v1, v2, v3 = 0, 1, 2 # Tuple
v1, v2, v3 = (0, 1, 2)

print(v1, v2, v3) # 0 1 2

*By default, only keys are assigned to variables from a dictrionary same as using keys().
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}.keys()

print(v1, v2, v3) # name age gender

*values() can get only the values from a dictionary.
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}.values()

print(v1, v2, v3) # John 36 Male

*items() can get both the keys and values from a dictionary.
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}.items()

print(v1, v2, v3)
# ('name', 'John') ('age', 36) ('gender', 'Male')

print(v1[0], v1[1], v2[0], v2[1], v3[0], v3[1])

When the icon is clicked, a vertical menu bar appears below the top bar, pushing the main document content downwards. When the icon is clicked again, the vertical menu bar disappears and the main document content rises up to its original placement.

Vendor lock-in refers to a situation where an organization becomes overly dependent on a specific vendor's products or services, making switching to alternatives costly, time-consuming, or technically difficult. Over the years, many companies have experienced frustration when trying to move away from large vendors like IBM, Microsoft, or Oracle due to contractual constraints, proprietary technologies, and sudden pricing changes. A recent example is VMware's acquisition by Broadcom, followed by significant pricing changes that disrupted many businesses.

If you’ve ever encountered the no main manifest attribute error while trying to run a JAR file in Java, you’re not alone. This common issue arises when the JAR file lacks the necessary metadata to specify the entry point of your application. This article will guide you through understanding this error, configuring your pom.xml file correctly, and successfully packaging your Java application into a runnable JAR file.
Understanding the Error
When you package a Java application into a JAR file, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) looks for a specific entry in the JAR's manifest file to understand where the main class is located. If this entry is missing, Java throws the no main manifest attribute error. This typically happens when the maven-jar-plugin isn't correctly configured in…]]></summary>

The Python code style guide is not set in stone. It evolves continuously with the development of the language. Some old conventions are gradually phased out, and new ones keep emerging. At the same time, many projects have their own coding style guides. When there are conflicts, the project-specific guides should be followed first. However, there is an important principle to keep in mind: "The stupid persistence in consistency is the monster of ignorance", which is a profound insight from Guido. Since code is often read more frequently than it is written, the core goal of the style guide is to improve code readability and keep all kinds of Python code consistent. As PEP20 says, "Readability counts".
The style guide emphasizes consistency. While …]]></summary>

With over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.
“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states.

But modern CSS offers something better — the power of clamp().
Still, using clamp() across different layout properties (like spacing, widths, typography) isn't always intuitive.
So let’s simplify it.

Here’s what the right tool can help you with:
✅ Boost productivity

✅ Cut down on trial-and-error

✅ Write cleaner, scalable CSS

✅ Build fluid layouts with fewer breakpoints

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I need to find a suitable foundational library for video processing. FFMpegCore works for one-shot things but despite a fluent API, its interface is still too command line like.
Here is what I found out:




OpenCvSharp
LibVLCSharp
FFMediaToolkit




Frames
✅ decode / encode
✅ (via callbacks)
❓


Audio
❌
✅ decode / encode / mux
❓


Extra libs
~5 MB/platform
+7 MB
+7 MB


Licence
Apache‑2.0
LGPLv2.1
MIT


Platforms
Win / mac / Linux / Arm
Win / mac / Linux / iOS / Android
Win / mac / Linux



LibVLCSharp seems more focused on directly displaying things (e.g. in Xamarine and WPF) instead of low-level API based processing; FFMediaToolkit, on the other hand, still depends on FFMPEG and can't avoid licensing issue. Eventually, I had to go with separate video + audio processing in favor of OpenCvSharp (it's Apache-2.0 by the way).
Notice OpenCVSharp has some advantage over EmguCV for custom dev:




OpenCvSharp
Emgu.CV




Licence
Apache-2.0 (fully permissive)
GPL v3 or commercial licence


Interop model
Pure P/Invoke (no C++/CLI), works on any .NET core runtime
Historically C++/CLI wrapper (needs Windows for full feature set), .NET Standard P/Invoke layer added later



NuGet size (native)
4–6 MB per RID (modular runtime packages)
30 MB + for the “opencv‑world” monolith, or 90 MB for emgucv‑runtime‑ubuntu



GPU (CUDA) support
Provided in separate OpenCvSharp4.runtime.dnn package
Official CUDA builds, but Windows‑only binaries unless you compile yourself


API surface
~1:1 with OpenCV C++ names (easy to port C++ samples)
Thicker .NET façade (e.g. Image<Bgr, byte> types), extra helpers


Cross‑platform stability
Actively tested on Windows / Linux / macOS / arm64
Windows the main focus; Linux/macOS possible with libopencv from distro or big runtime package


Learning curve
If you know OpenCV C++ you feel at home
Higher‑level abstractions can be friendlier for newcomers


Commercial support
Community‑driven
Paid licences & support available from Emgu CV, Inc.]]></summary>

Understanding memory allocation in Rust, especially heap allocation, is crucial for writing efficient and safe programs. A common point of confusion arises when working with stack and heap memory, as illustrated by discussions in the Rust community. There has been notable inquiry surrounding issues like stack overflow errors, which are often linked to how Rust manages memory. In this article, we will explore how Rust handles heap allocation and clarify why it behaves the way it does.
What is Heap Allocation in Rust?
Heap allocation in Rust occurs when we need to allocate memory dynamically, which is often necessary for larger data that cannot fit on the stack. The Rust programming language helps manage memory through a system of ownership, borrowing, and its smart pointers lik…]]></summary>

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun livestream.

The Modern Emoluments and Malfeasance Enforcement Act, or the MEME Act, aims to prevent federal officials from using their position to profit from memecoins, Democrat Senator Chris Murphy said in a May 6 statement. 
If passed, the MEME Act prohibits the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior executive branch officials, their spouses and children from issuing, sponsoring, or promoting a security, future, commodity, or digital asset, according to the bill’s description.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building components in Ruby using the Phlex library, developers often want the flexibility to use yield multiple times within a single component. The question arises: “Is it possible for a Phlex component to yield more than once?” In this blog post, we will explore this concept, the workings of the Phlex library, and provide a solution to achieve the desired functionality without modifying the method signatures.
Understanding Phlex Components
Phlex is a powerful library for creating HTML components in Ruby. It allows developers to craft reusable components easily while leveraging the power of Ruby's block syntax. The yield statement in Ruby is often used to pass control from a method back to a block that is supplied at the point of the method call.

Sure, we’ve moved beyond FTP dumps and cron jobs—hopefully. But even now, in 2025, it’s shocking how often integration is an afterthought. We default to old habits: point-to-point connections, fragile middleware setups, and hand-rolled glue code. It feels productive… until everything breaks.
If you’ve ever untangled a mess of connectors, patched together five tools to talk to each other, or babysat a brittle pipeline at 2 a.m.—you know what I mean.
The Problem Isn’t That We Don’t Care—It’s That We Start in the Wrong Place

I often randomly test the hyperlinks and they all worked, but I just realize that I only test the longest hyperlinks, because I think they are the ones more prone to hallucinations. I didn't find any hallucinations.
But yesterday I clicked some of the simpler links of r/Conservative summaries and I got 30% of them not working. I panicked because I thought the hallucination caught me off guard, but then I realized all the links were real, but they each got an additional ";" attached to them, which was redundant.
The links themselves were correct but the semicolons I used to declare the end of line was wrongly identified as part of the URLs. The fix was simple. I removed all redundant semicolons from all my current and previous output documents.
I am really surprised of this bug because it affected so many links but it evaded my "random" sampling for so long, because I didn't test the rendered URL links very thoroughly, and I thought very long and complex links were at higher risks of hallucination, so I tested those a lot. Weird enough, those never had problems, but the shorter, simpler links did. I am very sorry for the potential confusion it might have created.]]></summary>

This article will explore the common reasons for rejection, how to properly declare your app's use of foreground services, and best practices to ensure your app meets compliance standards.
Understanding Foreground Service Permission
Foreground services allow your application to perform long-running operations while the user is aware of what it is doing. These services are typically used for tasks that need to keep running even if the app is not actively in foreground.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and stock market performance is a subject of considerable interest to economists, investors, and policy makers alike. GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced by a country, and it serves as an indicator of the health and growth of an economy. The stock market, on the other hand, reflects the collective value of publicly traded companies and serves as a platform for buying and selling shares. Both metrics are often used to gauge economic conditions, yet their relationship is more complex than a simple correlation.
While there is a connection between GDP growth and stock market performance, this relationship is influenced by various factors, including investor sentiment, economic policies, and external events. In some c…]]></summary>

Today, we live in a world of microservices, APIs, and distributed everything. The architecture is elegant. The orchestration is powerful. But testing? That’s where things get tricky.
As a quality engineering leader, I’ve seen firsthand how this complexity tests more than just code—it tests our assumptions about ownership, accountability, and what “done” really means.
In a microservices ecosystem, a single user journey might hit a dozen services. Each is built, deployed, and owned by a different team. And while unit tests may pass with flying colors, it’s the integration points—those fragile handshakes between services—that often…]]></summary>

In Java, managing complex key structures dynamically is a common challenge, especially when dealing with API response times and performance issues. In your scenario, you're saving keys in a map formatted like Krishna/thota/date/x/y/z while supporting wildcard characters (*) to match various entries. However, this approach leads to performance overhead due to the necessity of comparing strings, which can be inefficient when handling over a million records. We’ll explore better data structures and solutions to enhance performance while allowing for the flexibility you need for matching.

Yet, as those early fans grew alongside the medium itself, uncomplicated childhood memories gave way to reflective curiosity. With maturity comes the realisation that even playful narratives can unwittingly reveal complex truths—sometimes challenging, always intriguing.
Among Spyro's cast, no group invites this reconsideration quite like the Gnorcs. Originally depicted as brutish, green-skinned adversaries to vanquish without second thought, today they stir conversation far beyond simple nostalgia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most teams spend hours documenting everything.
Notion workspaces. Confluence pages. GitHub wikis. You name it.
But here’s what happens:
☑️New hires still get stuck.  ☑️Devs still ask questions that are, “Somewhere in the docs” and crucial context gets lost.
This is the Documentation Paradox: The more you write, the harder it gets to find, trust, and maintain what actually matters.
Conventional wisdom says, “Async teams need tons of docs!”
But I’ll say: More docs often mean less clarity.
Here’s why:
First, there's the maintenance burden.
Every line of documentation is a liability that needs updating as your codebase evolves.
How many teams actually do that?
Second, comprehensive documentation creates a false sense of security.
Teams believe they're covered because it's in the docs somewhere.
What you should do is treat documentation as a conversation, not an artifact.
Use tools that make updating docs as easy as sending a message.
Encourage annotations and questions directly in the documentation.
And remember the 20/80 rule: 20% of your features generate 80% of questions. Focus your efforts there.
The goal isn't to have everything documented – it's to have the right documentation that actually helps your team move faster.
This is why every Rally session lives forever inside Jira
No more sorting through old Slack threads.
Every discussion stays tied to the task, so your team’s knowledge grows with the work—not in a dusty folder.]]></summary>

In this article, we'll explore how to convert strings while following the two scenarios provided in your request: changing capitalization and formatting string cases to appear more human-friendly.
Understanding the Humanization Process
When we discuss 'humanizing' a string, we're typically referring to text transformation that makes it easier for humans to read or understand. This can involve adjusting capitalization, changing the case, or formatting text to look more polished and readable. Unlike Ruby, where the humanize function applies well-defined transformations, C# requires us to craft our own methods.

When working with Rust and Diesel, you may encounter various issues, especially when performing count queries. In this article, we'll examine a specific error that arises from executing a count query using Diesel with PostgreSQL. The error message states, 'the trait bound i32: FromSql<BigInt, Pg> is not satisfied'. This indicates a type mismatch in your query resolution.
Understanding the Error
The error is primarily triggered because the Diesel ORM expects a specific data type from the SQL count result. Typically, when using the count function in a SQL query, the result is of type BigInt in PostgreSQL, which corresponds to i64 in Rust. However, your code attempts to return the result as an i32, leading to the compile error.

        <link href="https://dev.to/muhammad-ahsan-raza/introducing-one-linear-validator-a-lightweight-javascript-validation-library-d48"/>
        <updated>2025-05-06T21:50:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, Devs! 👋
I’m excited to announce the release of one-linear-validator, a minimalist and dependency-free JavaScript validation library that provides simple, one-liner functions for validating common data types like emails, phone numbers, URLs, hex colors, dates, and strong passwords.
Why One-Linear-Validator?
I created this package with the goal of providing an easy-to-use validation library that doesn't require complex setups or external dependencies. Whether you need to validate a user’s email, check the strength of a password, or confirm a valid hex color, one-linear-validator has got you covered.
Key Features
Phone Number Validation: Validate international phone numbers.
URL Validation: Ensure URLs are properly formatted.
Hex Color Validation: Verify if the input is a valid hex color code.
Date Validation: Validate dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format.
Strong Password Validation: Ensure the password meets certain strength criteria like minimum length, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
No Dependencies: The library is 100% dependency-free, ensuring that your project stays lightweight and fast.
Installation
npm install one-linear-validator
Or with yarn:
How to Use
Email Validation:
console.log(isEmail('example@example.com')); // { valid: true }
Password Strength Check:
const options = {
console.log(isStrongPassword('P@ssw0rd', options)); // { valid: true }
Phone Number Validation:
console.log(isPhoneNumber('+1234567890')); // { valid: true }
Hex Color Validation:
console.log(isHexColor('#ff5733')); // { valid: true }
Why Build This?
It's lightweight, dependency-free, and solves a common problem that many developers face. Whether you're building a small project or working with large-scale applications, this library is simple to implement and offers consistent, reliable results.
Contributing
If you’d like to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request. If you encounter any bugs or have feature requests, please raise an issue on the GitHub repository.]]></summary>

Las capas de cascada (cascade layers) en CSS han sido introducidas para resolver uno de los problemas más complejos y persistentes en la escritura de estilos: los conflictos de especificidad. En este artículo exploraremos cuál es exactamente ese problema y cómo la regla @layer nos ofrece una solución eficaz y moderna.
La regla @layer permite declarar estas capas de cascada, que funcionan de forma análoga a las capas en editores gráficos como Photoshop o GIMP: cada capa es un grupo independiente, pero en lugar de imágenes, gestionamos reglas CSS.
El objetivo principal es claro:
Organizar mejor el código.


Evitar los problemas clásicos de especificidad.

A aplicação guarda o endereço em memória e não o valor em si. Importantes casos são as arrays e os objetos. Exemplos Arrays, Objetos, Classes, String.
Os tipos primitivos são predefinidos (já definidos) em Java. Tipos não primitivos são criados pelo programador e não são definidos.
Tipos não primitivos podem ser usados para chamar métodos para realizar determinadas operações, enquanto tipos primitivos não podem.
Um tipo primitivo sempre tem um valor, enquanto os tipos não primitivos podem ser null.

It’s not all sunshine, though: the setup looks a bit dorky, only works on select Intel CPUs for now, saps battery life in a hurry and the glasses’ field of view could be wider.

In this article, we will talk about a rather unusual topic, information about which for some reason I did not find, although it is quite useful in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries for creating user interfaces, because, in some cases, applying the concept can help speed up work with the DOM several times.
The name is conditional, but the essence is important.
The term "usual state" refers to data that is saved directly due to the state managers, or due to the internal functionality of the framework or library. An example of the state in Vue.js:
createApp({
  setup() {
    return {
      count:ref(0);
    };
  },
  template: `<div>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before we dive in, it's worth noting a recent branding change: the assistant formerly known as Codeium is now called Windsurf. The rebranding aims to reposition the tool under a new identity, though the transition has caused some confusion in the community, particularly among terminal-centric users. For clarity, throughout this article, we will refer to the tool as Windsurf, its current official name.
Among terminal enthusiasts, NeoVim has established itself as a powerhouse of productivity. Combining lightness, extensibility, and full control over the development environment, it's become the go-to editor for developers who not only write code but carefully curate a streamlined workflow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is seeking permission from the court to drop an appeal against prediction market Kalshi. The move could allow the platform to offer political event contracts to users without contest.
In a May 5 filing in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for the CFTC filed an unopposed motion for voluntary dismissal, suggesting an agreement with Kalshi. The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.

  Demystifying HTTP for Web Developers, Part 2



In Part 1 of this series, we traced the full journey of an HTTP request — from typing a URL in the browser, through DNS resolution and TCP handshakes, all the way to receiving the server’s response. But understanding the path a request travels is only half the story. To truly master HTTP, we now need to dissect the payload that actually moves across the wire: the HTTP request itself.
Every interaction between a web client and a server begins with a carefully structured message — the request. It may look simple on the surface, but every line, header, and byte in that request carries meaning. If you’re building serious web applications, APIs, or even debugging flaky integrations, you can’t a…]]></summary>

Incorporating an MP3 audio player into a PHP script is a great way to enhance user experience on your website. Capturing playback time is particularly useful for tracking how long users engage with audio content. This article will guide you through the process of capturing the current playback value from an audio player implemented with HTML and integrating it into your PHP backend.
Understanding the Issue
You may be using an audio player in your PHP application and want to log how long the audio has been played by the user. This task usually involves a communication between the frontend (JavaScript) and the backend (PHP).

Ever doomscroll your way into developer rage? Yeah, me too.
So yesterday I was minding my own business (aka avoiding Jira) when I stumbled upon a blog where some dude proudly declared:
“Just finished 100 Days CSS Challenge!! 🥳🔥💯”
Cool flex, bro. But when I clicked in, expecting juicy breakdowns, clever hacks, or at least some trauma bonding... all I got was:
copy-paste StackOverflow energy, and I felt like I’d just been catfished by a portfolio piece.
So naturally, I did what any mentally unwell developer would do — I challenged myself to do 100 Days CSS in 10 Days.
Because why suffer slowly when you can suffer FAST?

When developing an iOS application using Flutter, you might come across the need to obfuscate your Dart code. Obfuscation can help protect your code from reverse engineering, making your app more secure. In this article, we'll address how to properly configure the extra_gen_snapshot_options_or_none flag in your Flutter project, particularly focusing on the iOS setup.
Why Obfuscate Dart Code?
Obfuscation of Dart code increases the protection of your intellectual property by making the source code harder to read and understand. This is especially crucial for apps that might handle sensitive data or proprietary algorithms. As Flutter's official documentation suggests, adding the right flags during the build process is vital.

The concerns about performance are valid; loading too many files can slow down your website significantly. So, can you simply combine all your CSS selectors into one general file? Let’s dive into this topic and explore the best approach to optimize your WordPress site.
Why Too Many CSS Files Can Slow Down Your Website
Having multiple CSS files means that the browser has to make many requests to the server to load all those stylesheets. Each request adds latency, which impacts your page load speed. From an SEO perspective, page speed is crucial as it affects user experience and, consequently, your search engine ranking. Thus, it’s essential to eliminate excess CSS files.

The weak US dollar and gold rally signal a shift to scarce assets.

The US Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decision on May 7 will be a defining moment for risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies. While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.
A more accommodative monetary policy could stimulate activity, but the Federal Reserve (Fed) is also contending with a weakening US dollar. Some analysts argue that a US interest rate cut may fail to stimulate growth as recession risks persist, potentially creating an ideal envir…]]></summary>

At least in my experiment, Codestral's performance is, frankly, disappointing. While it produces code that follows a certain architecture, the code quality is low. In fact, it even generates a statement of the form a = foo() where a has a different type from what foo() returns. Read on for more details.

Stay with TypeScript if:



You're web-focused (Angular/React)
Your team knows TS well
You need Node.js compatibility
Choose Dart if:



Cross-platform is your goal
Dev productivity is crucial
You want single-codebase apps
Pro Tip:

Try Dart for your next internal tool before committing to big projects.
Not for web apps, but it's leading for mobile/desktop.
No, but Flutter Web is now production-ready.
Focused on WASM, not competing with Dart.
Server-side (though improving).

Did you know? In 2023, over 60% of phishing attacks used AI tools to mimic human writing styles, making scams harder to spot. As artificial intelligence (AI) grows smarter, cybercriminals are weaponizing it to launch sneaky, personalized phishing attacks. But here’s the big question: Can these AI tricks fool even cybersecurity pros? Let’s break it down.
What Makes AI-Powered Phishing Different?
Poor grammar or spelling mistakes.
Can AI Outsmart Cybersecurity Experts?

How Cybersecurity Experts Fight Back?

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market.

In today's digital age, the financial world is undergoing a significant transformation. One of the most groundbreaking developments is asset tokenization, which involves converting real-world assets like real estate, stocks, or commodities into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process offers numerous benefits, including increased liquidity, faster transactions, and broader access to investment opportunities.
However, with these advancements come challenges, particularly in ensuring that these digital transactions comply with existing laws and regulations. This is where smart contracts come into play. Smart contracts are self-executing computer programs that automatically enforce the terms of an agreement. They can be programmed to ensure that every tokenized asset transact…]]></summary>

However, while cloud computing brings speed and flexibility, managing cloud costs can often feel like a challenge. This is where understanding the benefits of cloud TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) becomes crucial. 
Cloud TCO, or Total Cost of Ownership in the cloud, refers to the complete financial estimate of running cloud infrastructure over time. It doesn't just include your monthly cloud bill but also covers hidden costs like software licenses, data transfers, storage, maintenance, labor, and downtime. By calculating cloud TCO, businesses can see the full picture of their cloud spending and make better budgeting decisions.
Many companies mistakenly focus only on upfront pricing models when choosing cloud solutions. However…]]></summary>

The traditional public API, for a long time the bedrock of modern software integration, is finding its dominance challenged. As AI transforms business operations, two emerging protocols are reshaping how organisations expose their data and capabilities: the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol.
This shift isn't merely a technical curiosity, it represents a fundamental reimagining of how businesses connect with AI systems and how these systems interact with each other. While APIs aren't disappearing, their role is being dramatically redefined. For companies seeking competitive advantage in an AI-powered future, understanding and strate…]]></summary>

This scenario is common for database tasks involving JSON-like structures, particularly in systems like Snowflake. By utilizing advanced SQL techniques, you can simplify data manipulation and achieve a transformed view of your data without explicitly naming each key.
Understanding the Problem
The need to pivot object keys arises when you have a table with a column storing semi-structured data types like objects. In our case, we have a table objects_to_pivot where the attributes column contains various object keys that might not be consistent across rows. The challenge is to convert these dynamic object keys into fixed column nam…]]></summary>

EventTarget is the foundation of the browser’s event system.
addEventListener, removeEventListener, and dispatchEvent.
Many core Web APIs including DOM elements like <button>, <div>, <input>, as well as document and window inherit from EventTarget.

When we attach an event handler to a DOM element—like in the picture above—we’re actually subscribing to that element through one of its event channels.
In this case:
The button is the publisher (or emitter)
The callback function passed to addEventListener is the subscriber (or listener)
So when a user clicks the button, the button emits a 'click' event, and all registered listeners for that event type are notified and executed.

With this last release of Wanix, I'm at it again. This time with the successor to Unix, a little known operating system called Plan 9 from Bell Labs.

O Decorator é um padrão de projeto estrutural que permite adicionar comportamentos adicionais a um objeto de forma dinâmica.

Isso possibilita adicionar ou remover comportamentos com facilidade, mantendo o código mais flexível e desacoplado.
Em resumo, o Decorator cria uma cadeia de responsabilidades onde cada classe pode adicionar sua funcionalidade à sequência, sem afetar as outras.

TypeScript has quickly become a favorite tool for developers building scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications. At its core, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript—it builds upon JavaScript by introducing static typing, as well as other modern programming concepts that make your code safer and easier to manage. Static typing means that developers can explicitly define the types of data (like string, number, or boolean) their variables and functions work with, catching potential errors during development instead of at runtime.

In a May 6 notice, Ayotte announced on social media that New Hampshire would be permitted to “invest in cryptocurrency and precious metals” through a bill passed in the state Senate and House of Representatives. House Bill 302, introduced in New Hampshire in January, will allow the state’s treasury to use funds to invest in cryptocurrencies with a market capitalization of more than $500 billion, eliminating many tokens and memecoins.

TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript designed to add type safety and developer-friendly features to JavaScript code. A "superset" means that TypeScript builds on JavaScript by adding new functionalities, while still allowing you to write plain JavaScript. One of its most powerful features is the introduction of types (a system to define constraints on the structure of your data). This is immensely beneficial when working in large projects to detect errors at compile time, ensuring your codebase is reliable and maintainable.
Types in TypeScript help us describe the shape of an object, function, or data. For instance, when you define a function or an object, you can explicitly specify what inputs it expects and…]]></summary>

TypeScript is a popular open-source programming language developed by Microsoft. It’s often referred to as a superset of JavaScript because it builds on JavaScript by adding optional static types. These types allow developers to define the structure and behavior of variables, functions, and objects, making programs easier to debug and maintain. TypeScript compiles to plain JavaScript for execution, which means it seamlessly integrates with existing JavaScript projects.
Simply put, types in TypeScript are what allow you to specify the kind of data a variable or function should handle. For instance, you can declare that a variable must always hold a number, a string, or a custom structure (like objects or classes). By catching errors …]]></summary>

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript. This means that it builds on top of JavaScript by adding an optional type system (a way to define and enforce the kinds of data being used in your code). TypeScript is a powerful language designed to catch errors early during development, making your JavaScript codebases more robust and maintainable.
In TypeScript, "types" play a central role. A type defines the shape of data, specifying what kind of data will be stored, its expected structure, and the operations you can perform on it. For example, string, number, boolean, and object are common types used in TypeScript. Types ensure that your code only operates on the data it was designed to handle; if it doesn’t match t…]]></summary>

In recent years, the world of finance has seen significant advancements, especially with the introduction of blockchain technology. One of the most exciting developments in this space is the concept of tokenization, particularly the tokenization of U.S. equities (stocks). But what exactly does tokenization mean, and why is it so important for U.S. equities? 
What is Tokenization?
Tokenization refers to the process of converting ownership of an asset, such as stocks, real estate, or artwork, into a digital token on a blockchain. This token represents ownership or a portion of ownership of the underlying asset. In the case of U.S. equities, tokenization means turning traditional company shares into digital tokens that are recorded on a blockchain ledger.

I recently launched VidSabio, a platform that transforms ordinary videos into structured, interactive learning experiences — automatically. 🎥➡️📚
But this didn’t come together overnight.
At first, I thought a single LLM could handle everything: analyze the video, transcribe it, generate quizzes, build a course. Easy, right?
Wrong.
It turned out the real breakthrough came when I stopped looking for one model to do it all — and instead built a pipeline of specialized steps, each powered by the best tool for that specific task.
Here’s the high-level breakdown of how it works:
User uploads a video
Video is processed through a multi-step pipeline:
Frame extraction (FFmpeg)
Audio transcription (Google Speech-to-Text)
Visual analysis (Gemini / GPT-4 Vision)
Content summarization + topic generation (Gemini Pro)
Course structure generation (GPT-4)
Interactivity injection (quizzes, accordions, etc.)


Final course can be edited and exported as SCORM or HTML
This is all built using Vue 3, Firebase, and various LLMs (OpenAI + Gemini) stitched together through Cloud Functions.
By distributing the heavy lifting across multiple LLMs and APIs, I was able to:
Improve accuracy
Scale more efficiently
Debug and retry isolated steps
Customize outputs based on step-level feedback
Frontend: Vue 3 + Tailwind
Backend: Firebase Functions + Firestore + Storage
AI: GPT-4.1, Gemini Pro, Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text
Analytics: PostHog
Export: SCORM, HTML
Here's a stylized diagram of the flow:
(Insert your HappyAlien-styled image here)
This was built with plenty of detours, dead ends, and "aha" moments. If you're building with LLMs, I encourage you to explore multi-model orchestration — it might be the key to your next breakthrough.

I just launched a side project I’ve been tinkering with:
GitVisualize
It lets you paste in any public GitHub repo URL, and it’ll generate a visual representation of that project using OpenAI’s gpt-image-1 model — all based on the repo’s README content.
Takes a GitHub repo URL
Pulls the README
Feeds it to an AI image model
Displays the generated image alongside project metadata
Adds it to a public gallery
You can even choose the image style you want:
Conceptual & Techy
Infographic
Abstract & Minimalist
Direct & Clear
It’s built with Vue 3 + Tailwind, uses Supabase for storage and data, and everything runs through a lightweight backend on Render.
I love browsing GitHub, and I wondered:
“What would this project look like if it were a picture?”
So I built GitVisualize as a fun experiment in combining AI, dev culture, and a bit of creativity. Some of the results are surprisingly expressive.
Frontend: Vue 3 + Tailwind
Backend: Node/Express (Render)
AI: OpenAI gpt-image-1


Storage/DB: Supabase
Design direction: Lighthearted “Happy Alien” aesthetic 🛸
➡️ https://gitvisualize-web.onrender.com/
Paste a repo, pick a style, and see what AI dreams up!
I’d love feedback, ideas, or feature suggestions.

Before we dive into coding, let's quickly explore why stream+json exists. Often, you need to send large arrays of JSON via APIs. You could send this large array from the server all at once, but when PHP receives it, PHP loads everything into memory.
While this method works, it can cause issues such as:

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

In addition to these capabilities, MongoDB supports advanced search techniques through its Atlas Search index, based on Apache Lucene. This can be used for near-real-time analytics and, combined with aggregation pipeline, add some online analytical processing (OLAP) capabilities. Thanks to the document model, this analytics capability doesn't require a different data structure and enables MongoDB to execute hybrid transactional and analytical (HTAP) workloads efficiently, as demonstrated in this article with an example from a healthcare domain.

In this article, we'll explore how to decrypt cookie values retrieved from Google Chrome using C#. If you've stumbled upon encrypted cookies in your code and need a way to decrypt these values effectively, you're in the right place. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the decryption process while using C#.
Understanding the Issue
When accessing cookies stored by Google Chrome, it is common to encounter encrypted values. The cookies are stored in a SQLite database, and the encrypted values can pose a challenge when you need to retrieve the actual data. Chrome uses a specific encryption mechanism that relies on Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) for Windows systems. Therefore, to decrypt the cookies, you must understand this encryption approach.

# install docker
sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo=https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo
sudo dnf install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
sudo systemctl enable docker.service

# make docker sudo
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo systemctl restart docker

Making docker part of the sudo group allows you to use docker commands like docker ps without needing to add sudo at the beginning.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with APIs, we often encounter data in formats that do not match our application's preferred coding style. For instance, if you're using TypeScript and Vue.js, you might receive data in snake_case from an API but prefer to work with camelCase throughout your application. The good news is that you can easily transform this data without losing type safety. Let's delve into how you can achieve that with the help of interfaces and utility types in TypeScript.
Understanding the Problem
When you define an interface such as MergedReviewDetails, you structure your data according to your application's needs. An example of this could be:
export interface MergedReviewDetails {
  parentReview: Mmcid;
  childReviews: Mmcid[];
}

However, the API might return data with properties in snake_ca…]]></summary>

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …]]></summary>

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.
Uncertainty about practical applications
Blockchain offers some big promises: faster settlements, stronger security and better transparency. But actually applying those promises across banking, accounting and operations is still complicated.

Passing parameters from ASP.NET MVC page models to TypeScript functions can be tricky, especially when incorporating dynamic values such as token, url, and redirectUrl. In this guide, we will explore how to accomplish this effectively, ensuring that we maintain optimal coding practices.
Understanding the Basics
When working with TypeScript and ASP.NET MVC, it is crucial to understand how data flows between the server-side (C# code) and client-side (TypeScript/VBScript/JavaScript code). The Link.ts you provided defines an interface LinkConfig and an asynchronous function postData. This function needs to be called with correctly structured parameters that are passed from your Razor pages.

✍️ Introduction
At IBM, I led the transformation of one such platform: the Cognitive Support Platform (CSP). Originally built as a monolithic, Salesforce-native application, it had outgrown its architecture. We rebuilt it from the ground up into a modular, event-driven, cloud-native system infused with AI.
The results were real and measurable:
✅ 70% increase in system availability
✅ 90%+ reduction in AI inference costs
✅ 80% improvement in platform security
✅ 70% boost in developer productivity
In this article, I’ll share the architectural strategies, DevOps patterns, and AI integration principles that made this transformation successful and scalable.

Tailgating, a subtle yet dangerous form of intrusion, happens when an unauthorized person gains access to a restricted area by following closely behind someone who is authorized. It's a tactic that relies less on technology and more on exploiting human behavior.
Attackers often masquerade as employees, contractors, or delivery workers. They may carry packages, wear uniforms, or claim to have forgotten their access badge—all to lower suspicion. Once inside, these individuals can do far more than just roam the premises. They might access critical systems, plant malicious software, or steal sensitive equipment.

In a May 6 joint hearing of the HFSC and House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Waters remained standing while addressing Republican leadership, saying she intended to block proceedings due to Donald Trump’s corruption, “ownership of crypto,” and oversight of government agencies. Digital asset subcommittee chair Bryan Steil, seemingly taking advantage of a loophole in committee rules, said Republican lawmakers would continue with the event as a “roundtable” rather than a hearing.
HFSC Chair French Hill urged lawmakers at the hearing to create a “lasting framework” on digital assets, but did not directly address any of Rep. Waters’ and Democrats’ concerns about Trump’s involvement with the crypto industry. He claimed Waters was making the hearing a partisan issue and shutting down discussion on a digital asset regulatory framework.

Nothing wrong, right?
Except... I was starting to hate reading my own code.
range(len(...)). Too much manual indexing.
👀 The Realization
for i, value in enumerate(my_list):
    # Do something with i and value

Wait... what?
No range(len(...))? No messy indexing?
✅ Cleaner
🧠 Why it works:
enumerate() is a built-in Python function that returns both the index and the value of items in an iterable—in one shot.
It’s like your loop suddenly gained superpowers.
💡 Bonus Tip:
for i, val in enumerate(my_list, start=1):
    print(f"Item {i}: {val}")

Perfect for user-facing counters. No more +1 hacks.
🚫 Never Again...
No more range(len(...)) unless I really need it.
Now, it’s all enumerate(), all day.
✨ Moral of the Story:
If you're reaching for range(len(...)), stop and ask yourself—
What would enumerate() do? 😎]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As your Markdown-based knowledge base grows, it becomes harder to manage without a clear structure. Categorizing your content into folders and using simple metadata makes your system scalable, readable, and maintainable — all while staying lightweight.
Group your Markdown files into categories using folders:
docs/

│   ├── setup.md
│   └── deployment.md
├── faq/
│   ├── general.md
│   └── troubleshooting.md
├── references/

You can use folder names like guides, faq, or references as logical categories when generating UI elements or menus.
Add YAML frontmatter at the top of your Markdown files for more control:
---
title: "Setup Guide"
category: "Guides"
tags: ["installation", "setup"]

When working with third-party SDKs that leverage Jetpack Compose, developers can often run into issues that only appear in the final APK. In this article, we will explore a specific case of a NoSuchMethodError that arises during navigation to a Compose-based screen of a third-party SDK. This problem can be particularly frustrating, as it does not occur when running the app straight from Android Studio, but instead manifests when generating a debug APK via the command line.
Understanding the Issue
The problem at hand is encapsulated by the error message:
java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No static method slideIntoContainer(...) in class androidx.compose.animation.AnimatedContentTransitionScope. This error typically indicates that the compiler is unable to find a specific method at r…]]></summary>

This is one of my favorite quotes. It touches on something I see in the best engineers I've ever worked with, and something missing from many others. Something that's frustratingly illusive in the world of software engineering. A principle valued by most everyone, but executed by few. What is this trait possessed by the very best in our industry, you ask? What is it that great engineers do that sets them apart from the rest?
Great engineers build complex systems by writing simple code.
Let's cut to the chase: if you're writing code that takes your colleagues 20 minutes, two cups of coffee, and a string of "What the F%&#s" to understand, you're doing it wrong. Period.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
When working with Svelte and TypeScript, you might run into challenges regarding event typing. A common scenario involves handling input events from an <input> element and wanting to replace the generic any type with a more specific InputEvent. This article will explore how to accurately type the input event in Svelte using TypeScript, allowing you to harness the benefits of type checking while eliminating the use of any.
Understanding the Issue
You are currently using an input handler function that looks like this:
function emitChange(event: any) {
    const text = event.target.value;
    dispatch("changeContent", { text });
}

While this function works, it relies on the any type, which defeats the purpose of using TypeScript. In your attempt to switch to InputEvent, you enco…]]></summary>

In my latest video, I walk you through how to write and use functions in TypeScript. Whether you're transitioning from JavaScript or just getting started with TS, this tutorial is designed to help you build a solid foundation.
📺 Watch the full tutorial on YouTube:









  
  
  🚀 What You'll Learn:


✅ Declaring functions with TypeScript

✅ Arrow functions vs traditional functions

✅ Typing function parameters and return values

✅ Optional and default parameters

✅ Clean code and best practices
JavaScript is flexible — sometimes too flexible. TypeScript introduces structure by enforcing types, reducing bugs and making your code easier to understand and maintain.
With TypeScript, functions can clearly define:
What kind of arguments they accept
What type of result they return
Whether certain parameters are required or optional
Here’s a quick example:
function greet(name: string = "Dev"): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}


`
This function:
Takes a name parameter of type string

Has a default value ("Dev")
Returns a string



And TypeScript will enforce all of that at compile-time!
Real-life function examples
Why arrow functions behave differently (especially with this)
Tips for writing scalable functions in a TypeScript project

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

At the Token2049 event in Dubai, DoubleZero Labs founder and former Solana head of strategy Austin Federa told Cointelegraph that today's high-performance blockchains like Solana are technically capable of supporting large-scale institutional usage. However, lawyers still need to catch up. 
“Most blockchains nowadays, especially things like Solana, are fast enough for institutions to use them,” Federa said. “It’s really more about the institutions and the institution’s lawyers getting comfortable with crypto.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RDMA(Remote Direct Memory Access)는 네트워크를 통해 서버 간에 CPU 개입 없이 메모리를 직접 읽고 쓰는 기술이다. 주로 고성능 컴퓨팅(HPC), 대규모 데이터 처리, AI/ML 분산 학습 환경 등에서 낮은 지연 시간과 높은 대역폭을 제공하기 때문에 많이 사용한다. 
1. RDMA의 기본 개념
일반적인 네트워크 통신 방식에서는 데이터를 전송하려면 CPU가 메모리에서 데이터를 읽고, 네트워크 인터페이스 카드(NIC)로 복사한다. 
이 복사한 데이터를 네트워크를 통해 데이터를 보내고, 수신 측에서도 CPU가 데이터를 NIC에서 메모리로 복사한다. 이 과정에서 CPU, 커널, 복사 작업 등이 개입되어 지연(latency)과 CPU 오버헤드가 큰 현상이 발생한다. 
반면, RDMA는, CPU나 운영체제(OS) 커널의 개입 없이, 원격 시스템의 메모리에 직접 읽기(read) 또는 쓰기(write) 작업을 수행한다. 다시 말해, 데이터가 직접 메모리에서 메모리로 이동한다.
2. RDMA가 동작하는 방식
(1) 메모리 등록 (Memory Registration)
송신자와 수신자 모두 RDMA NIC(HCA: Host Channel Adapter)를 사용함.
RDMA를 사용하기 위해서는 사용할 메모리 영역을 등록(pinning)해야 함. 이 과정에서 해당 메모리는 물리 메모리에 고정되고 커널이 RDMA NIC에 메모리 주소를 알려줌. 
(2) Queue Pair 생성
RDMA 통신은 QP(Queue Pair)라는 구조를 통해 이루어짐. 
QP는 Send Queue와 Receive Queue로 구성…]]></summary>

This walkthrough will guide you through the attacker's perspective, where we gain access to the system, and the defender's perspective, where we analyze logs to track the attack.
Step 1: Initial Reconnaissance
Before diving into exploitation, we need to gather information about the target system.
Running an Nmap Scan
Start by scanning the target machine to identify open ports and services, i used the following code:
nmap -A -sV -sS 10.10.155.253(YOUR_MACHINEIP) -T4

but you can have the same results as shown with this:
nmap -A -T4 -p- 10.10.155.253(YOUR_MACHINEIP)

But what exactly is Web3, and how does it differ from Web2? Let’s dive deep into this new era of decentralized technology and explore its impact on industries, users, developers, and startups.
What is Web3 and How Does it Differ from Web2?
The fundamental difference between Web2 and Web3 is the concept of decentralization. While Web2 relies on intermediaries to mediate transactions and data exchanges, Web3 removes these intermediaries by allowing users to interact directly with one another via peer-to-peer networks.

In a Cointelegraph interview, Kozyakov said that while crypto payments are seeing an increase in adoption and demand, the asset class won’t be fully replacing fiat money anytime soon. He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 
“We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”

Now that we’ve gotten a solid grip on the Catalysis Ecosystem, it’s time to zoom out and see how it’s making waves in the real world.

Catalysis, a project that’s helping make blockchains more secure, just raised $1.25 million to create a new kind of security system. This new system will help make it easier for developers to keep their blockchain networks safe by sharing security across different platforms. Think of it like a special tool that helps everyone stay protected in the world of blockchains.
The money was raised from some big names, like Hashed Emergent, which helps Web3 projects in Asia, and others like Presto Labs, SpaceshipDAO, and Cosmostation. These investors are excited about Catalysis because they believe the project can really h…]]></summary>

Each day, the Scraper ventured out, gathering essential tools—brake pads, spark plugs, and oil filters—meticulously putting them in his storage room. This storage room, filled with parts, was like a database, organizing all the precious data he gathered from various sources.
For instance, one day, the Scraper found a batch of brake pads. He cataloged the details, from brand to condition, and stored it safely. This was like collecting the latest prices from websites, storing them in a file for future use.
The Backend Guy: The Toolbox Handler
Whenever the mechanic—the Frontend—needed a specific tool, they would call out, “I need a 10mm wrench!” The Backend Guy, standing by the toolbox, would find the correct tool and hand it over with precision. He didn't fix the car himself, but he made sure the mechanic had exactly what was needed at the right time.
Just like that, the Backend Guy managed the storage of all the data and ensured it was always ready when the Frontend needed it. When the mechanic asked for the current price of the Euro in Toman, the Backend would retrieve that data and send it in a neat package—a JSON response—ready to be used.
The Frontend Mechanic: The User Interface
When the mechanic needed a part, they'd shout, "I need a 10mm wrench!" The Backend Guy would respond, handing over the tool, and the Frontend Mechanic would get to work. The mechanic didn’t care how the part got there, as long as it was the right one.
In the same way, the Frontend Mechanic used the data provided by the Backend to create an amazing display for the car's dashboard. They made sure the car (or website) looked stunning, with neatly organized parts (like the prices) and a smooth-running engine (user interface). Whether it was showing prices in a nice table or providing a simple, user-friendly experience, the Frontend Mechanic made sure everything was visually appealing and functional.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has come a long way since its beginnings. What started as spinning up cloud resources has now grown into a full-blown ecosystem with a very engaged community. IaC on its own can add a lot of complexity to your processes and cause more issues, but combined with governance, compliance, security, deployment strategies, self-service, it easily becomes the fuel your delivery engine needs.
This year, IaCConf debuts as a virtual event by bringing together this community, and it’s shaping up to be one of the most relevant and practical events in the space.
Unlike broader DevOps/SRE or cloud-native events, IACConf is focused on the challenges and innovations around defining infrastructure as code. That means the content goes deeper, the conversations are more relevant, and the takeaways are directly applicable to your processes.
There will be sessions on:
Getting started with IaC
Managing IaC at scale across teams and environments (using OpenTofu, Terraform, Ansible, Crossplane, and others)
Platform Engineering and IaC
How IaC impacts your maturity
AI in IaC
And that’s just scratching the surface. Check out the full agenda here.
One of the things I appreciate most about this conference is that it’s not about product pitches or high-level fluff. Practitioners share what worked, what broke, and how they improved. Whether you are just starting out, are in the trenches, or shaping platform strategy, there’s something for you here.
On another note, I’m also excited to contribute to this year’s lineup with a session on Getting Started with IaC, together with my colleague Emin Alemdar. But honestly, I’m just as excited to learn and to connect with others working through the same challenges.
The event will be on Thu, May 15, 2025 @ 11:00am EDT, so don’t forget to register here.

When I first started learning Go (Golang), everything felt a little strange. Coming from the Python and JavaScript background😅😅., I expected to deal with new syntax, but I didn’t expect to get stuck on the very first line of every Go file:

I remember asking myself:
"Why do we declare the package name before the start of any code?"
📦 What Is a Package in Go?
In Go, as well as other languages like Python, a package is a way to organize and reuse code. Every .go file must start by declaring which package it belongs to.
There are two kinds of packages you’ll encounter early on:

Understanding repr(transparent)


The #[repr(transparent)] attribute in Rust is used to indicate that a struct represents a single variant of a type that can be safely treated as equivalent to its single field. This is particularly useful for effectively working with opaque types or for implementing newtype patterns.

In a May 5 letter to the US Office of Government Ethics, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Jeff Merkley said that Trump and his family stand to personally profit from an investment involving UAE state-backed firm MGX, crypto exchange Binance and World Liberty Financial (WLFI).
The senators called for an urgent probe, warning the deal may violate the US Constitution’s Emoluments Clause and federal bribery statutes.
At the center of the controversy is WLFI’s USD1 stablecoin, reportedly chosen for a $2 billion investment MGX plans to make into Binance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
When developing Angular applications, particularly with Angular Material, you might encounter issues regarding the mat-list and mat-divider components. Many developers wonder whether to use ngFor inside the mat-list or the mat-list-item and how to correctly place the mat-divider. Let’s delve into this topic to clarify which method is best.
Why This Issue Arises
The confusion around where to implement ngFor and the positioning of mat-divider often stems from how Angular handles component rendering. Using ngFor within the mat-list means that each item is rendered as part of the list itself; thus, the dividers are less likely to show correctly if their placement isn’t considered carefully. Conversely, applying ngFor to mat-list-item makes each list item independent and potentiall…]]></summary>

Unlike traditional firewalls that operate primarily at the network or transport layer, proxy firewalls operate at the application layer. They intercept requests, evaluate the content, and relay approved traffic.

Many developers encounter challenges when adapting their workflow to the mobile-first approach in Tailwind CSS, especially those who prefer a desktop-first design methodology. While Tailwind CSS v3 made this easier through global configuration options, the introduction of Tailwind CSS v4 has made some of these features feel less intuitive. In this article, we will explore how to effectively configure Tailwind CSS v4 to achieve a desktop-first layout while maintaining responsive design principles.
Understanding the Desktop-First Approach
The desktop-first approach emphasizes designing for larger screens first, and then using media queries to adapt the design for smaller screens. This method allows developers to create a well-structured layout that looks good on large displays b…]]></summary>

예를 들어, meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct에서 훈련(Training) 또는 추론(Inference)할 때, Tensor Type으로 BF16 이면 메모리 크기는 얼마이며, 몇 장의 GPU를 사용해야 하는가에 대해 묻는다면, 어떻게 답변을 해야 하는지 알아 볼 것이다
메모리 사용량 개략적 계산 = (모델 파라미터 * 2) +  파라미터의 2 - 3배 


BF16(bfloat16)은 FP16과 마찬가지로 16비트 정밀도를 사용하므로, 기본적으로 모델 파라미터*자체가 차지하는 메모리는 FP16 대비 큰 차이가 없음.
AdamW 와 같은 옵티마이저 상태나 그래디언트, 중간 활성화 (activations) 등으로 인해 실제 요구되는 메모리는 2~3배 가량 될 수 있음.
계산식: (16 * 2)  + (16GB * 2 or 16GB * 3) = 32GB + (32 or 48 )GB = 64 or 80 GB
BF16 타입으로 풀 파인튜닝(Full fine-tuning)시 



단일 GPU으로는 최소 40GB 이상, 안정적인 배치 크기 확보를 위해서는 A100/H100 80GB급이 1장이 권장

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have an ambitious technical idea that I hope to share with the community of developers and cybersecurity specialists:
Given the widespread prevalence of pornographic content online, and the difficulty of controlling it through traditional blocking or weak censorship tools, I've come up with a new system:
🔐 An "ethical operating system" (for smart devices – such as Android, iOS, and Windows) built from the ground up on the principle of:
"Completely blocking any type of pornographic content, whether visual or textual, whether on websites, apps, search engines, or social networks."
💡 Key features of the idea:
Its protection cannot be hacked or changed (such as the inability to install an alternative system).
It can be installed on children's devices, school devices, or even the devices of adults who want to protect themselves.
It doesn't rely solely on blocking a specific site, but rather on real-time content analysis.
A clean app store and a clean built-in search engine.
🧱 Technically:
Or as a distribution for children, schools, or conservative environments.
Or even as a layer of security added to existing systems (e.g., Android).
🎯 The goal is not to impose censorship, but rather to provide a safe, ethical, and educational alternative.
🤝 I'm looking for:
Interested programmers. Note that I'm only 16 years old. The goal is to find someone who will embrace this idea.
Suggestions for improving the idea.
Any technical or community support is possible.
Do you think this type of system could make a real difference?

Understanding the Issue
The main problem stems from the timing and lifecycle of updating the memo in your workflow executions. When you call the upsertMemo method, it is crucial to ensure that the memo is set correctly and acknowledged before you attempt to retrieve it from the workflow executions.
In your code, the memo appears to be set successfully, as confirmed by the output of console.log. However, the memo is not persisted as expected when viewed thro…]]></summary>

Dolphins whistle and click to talk in the ocean.
Dogs bark, growl, and wag their tails to show how they feel.
Bees do a dance to show others where to find flowers.

우리가 흔히 오픈소스(OpenSource)라고 하는 말은, 누구나 자유롭게 활용, 수정, 재배포할 수 있는 라이선스”라는 의미로 쓰인다. 실제로는 OSI(Open Source Initiative)가 공인한 라이선스인지, 아니면 사용 제한 조항(예: 비영리 사용만 가능 등)이 있는 “준(準)오픈소스” 형태인지를 구분해야 한다. 그렇다면, 이에 대해 한 번 알아보자!
현재 LLM 중에서 OSI가 승인한 오픈소스 라이선스는 다음과 같다.

In this article, we will delve into how wctomb works and explore alternative methods for converting surrogate characters to their UTF-8 equivalents.
Understanding wctomb


The wctomb function in C is designed to convert a wide character (of type wchar_t) to a multibyte character (typically in UTF-8 encoding). However, it has its limitations when it comes to surrogate pairs, which are a special way of encoding characters that are outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) in Unicode. These characters range from U+D800 to U+DFFF. When trying to convert these values using wctomb, you might encounter unexpected results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the smoldering forges of Old Valyria, where currents roar like dragons and energy flows like wildfire, there sits a silent sovereign—the TWCT-T-D55. Forged in the fires of precision and crowned with 1% accuracy, this current transformer rules the Seven Realms of energy monitoring with the ruthlessness of Tywin Lannister and the cunning of Littlefinger. Let us bend the knee to the unyielding guardian of amps and volts.

Chapter 1: The Forge of Dragonstone
TWCT-T-D55 is no mere ironborn gadget. Cast in the Foundries of Valyrian Steel, it wields powers lost to lesser sensors:
Dragonflame Precision: Measures 200A with 1% accuracy—sharper than Oathkeeper’s edge.
Why it shatters the old order:
Legacy CTs: Clumsy as Hodor, bumbling through phase shifts and kWh errors.
Chapter 2: The War of Five Circuits
The Battle of Blackwater Bay (Smart Factories):
TWCTs stalk energy vampires like Arya’s List, slashing waste with Needle-like precision. “Chaos isn’t a pit. It’s a $15k savings,” they whisper.
The Siege of Highgarden (Solar Farms):
Guards solar arrays against hail storms and incompetence, steadfast as Brienne’s oath. “No panel left behind.”
The Red Wedding (EV Chargers):
Halts faulty chargers mid-zap, sparing Teslas from becoming Dothraki funeral pyres. “The North remembers… proper grounding.”

The Words of House TWCT
Size: Slimmer than a Braavosi blade (55mm), deadlier than a Dornish spear.
The Dragons of Innovation
The Dark Threats Beyond the Wall
Legacy CTs: Bloat like Robert’s waistline, guzzling space and sanity.
The Prophecy of the Prince That Was Measured
The TWCT-T-D55 shall unite the grid.”
Epilogue: Winter is Here (And It’s Electrified)

“Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” read the announcement on GitHub by Bitcoin developer Greg Sanders on May 5. 
The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. 
The proposal (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs.

The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.
Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.

They’re too noisy. You get flooded with titles, buzzwords, and irrelevant project summaries. So I distilled everything down to one single task. One prompt I can give to anyone — junior or architect — and instantly get a signal.
The task?
Write a library that calculates the sum of a vector of values.
That’s it. No extra requirements. The beauty is that it looks trivial — but the depth reveals itself as the candidate explores edge cases, generalization, scalability, performance, and design.
Most junior candidates start like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backend development is the backbone of modern web applications. It manages server-side logic, data handling, authentication, and API communication.
In this post, we’ll explore backend dev using a JavaScript-first approach — with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as core tools.
Backend dev involves:
Managing servers
Handling databases
Writing business logic
Serving REST APIs
JavaScript (Node.js) – Great for full-stack JS
Python – Django, Flask
Java – Spring Boot
PHP/Ruby – Mature, flexible choices
SQL: PostgreSQL, MySQL
NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra
Use REST APIs to perform CRUD operations over HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Tools like Express.js make building APIs fast and flexible.
Express.js (Node)
Django (Python)
Spring (Java)
ORMs help abstract SQL:
Prisma (Node.js)
Hibernate (Java)
Django ORM (Python)
Middleware: Auth, logging, request validation
Authentication: JWT, sessions, OAuth
File Uploads: Multer for handling media
Third-party APIs: Stripe, SendGrid, Google Login
Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend keeps your codebase consistent and efficient. With Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB, you get speed, scalability, and simplicity.

The good news: Bootstrap, one of the most popular front-end frameworks, already has built-in accessibility features—you just need to know how to use them correctly.
Let’s dive into how you can craft a user interface that works for everyone—and doesn’t require you to rebuild your UI from scratch.

Despite the rise of Swift, Objective-C remains a relevant and powerful language, particularly for maintaining legacy code and integrating with newer Swift code bases. As we move into 2025, understanding core patterns like delegation continues to be vital for developers working with Objective-C.
Delegation is a design pattern used in Objective-C to pass messages between objects and to provide a mechanism for customization of behavior. It allows one object to delegate tasks to another, enabling a clear separation of responsibilities and enhancing the modularity of applications.

But as the system expanded to support more than 10 folders, it required deploying and maintaining an equal number of nearly identical Lambda functions, each wired to specific prefixes and jobs. The architecture became increasingly brittle and harder to manage. 
This post outlines how that structure was replaced using EventBridge, with prefix-based filtering and direct Glue job targets. No Lambda. No maintenance overhead.

Encapsulation is like a medicine capsule: the outer shell hides the complex ingredient inside, delivering only the intended effect to your body. You don't need to know the chemical makeup to benefit from it.
Encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers. Python primarily uses two types of access modifier.
Private: Accessible from anywhere.


Public: Accessible only within the class.



Similarly, in programming, encapsulation wraps data and methods in a class, exposing a simple, controlled interface while keeping the internal details private and secure.
Let say I want to make "model" attribute private so that nobody can manipulate the model name.
So make it private just add '__model'
So, question arise if we can't access attribute but we can access function which include the private attribute.
Think of like if we have attribute which you don't want get manipulated then make it private.]]></summary>

If you're developing a MAUI application and are facing issues with the CarouselView control not displaying images from an ObservableCollection, you are not alone. This article will address why images may not show up in your CarouselView, even when the same image sources work perfectly with a standard Image control.
Understanding CarouselView in MAUI
The CarouselView in .NET MAUI is designed to display a collection of items in a swipeable format. Each item can be customized using a DataTemplate, which lets you define how each item appears. Typically, developers use ObservableCollection to bind dynamic data to CarouselView because it notifies the view of changes. However, while you may see indicators appear correctly, images may not load as expected.

A critical feature that sets it apart from other languages is its support for **dynamic typing**. This allows for a flexible development process that enhances code modularity and adaptability. But what truly is the purpose of dynamic typing in Objective-C?

## What is Dynamic Typing?

Dynamic typing refers to the ability of a programming language to determine the type of an object at runtime, rather than during compile-time. This contrasts with static typing, where the type of an object is known and enforced during compilation. In Objective-C, this means you do not have to specify the class type of an object, providing …]]></summary>

In Rust programming, a common error developers encounter is the 'borrowed data escapes outside of method' error. This typically happens when a reference does not match the expected lifetime, causing issues during compilation. In this article, we'll explore the reasons behind this error and how you can fix it to successfully print data from your NodesHeap structure while implementing the Debug trait.
Understanding the Borrowed Data Error
When you implemented the fmt::Debug for your NodesHeap, you're trying to generate a debug representation of your data structure using an iterator. The specific error you received states that the borrowed data escapes outside of the method.
This issue arises because in your implementation of the get_all function, the return type NodesHeapIterato…]]></summary>

In this blog, we'll demystify state management in Flutter and help you decide between Bloc, Riverpod, and Provider — three of the most popular approaches in the Flutter ecosystem.
State refers to the data your UI depends on. For example:
A counter’s value
Whether the user is logged in
The list of items in a shopping cart
State management is how we keep the UI in sync with the data — especially when multiple widgets care about the same data or when data changes over time.
There are two broad types:
Local state (e.g., setState inside a single widget)

If you're using Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 and noticing that your call to fieldClass.getDeclaredFields() returns an empty array, you're not alone. Many developers have encountered this issue when attempting to retrieve field information from classes in the Java Reflection API. The Java Reflection API is essential for inspecting classes at runtime, allowing developers to gather information about fields, methods, and constructors programmatically. However, certain security restrictions in JDK 17 can lead to unexpected behavior, including the inability to reflectively access declared fields in classes like Field.class from the java.lang.reflect package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine-tuning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task or dataset. Pre-trained models, especially large ones like GPT (from OpenAI) or BERT (from Google), are initially trained on massive datasets using general-purpose data. These models learn a broad understanding of language, patterns, or image features. However, for specialized tasks—like medical diagnosis, legal document analysis, or customer sentiment detection—fine-tuning helps the model learn domain-specific nuances.
The process involves continuing the training of the model with a smaller, task-specific dataset while adjusting the model’s weights slightly. This method allows the model to retain its general knowledge while becoming more effective in the target domain. Fine-tuning is far more efficient than training a model from scratch, saving both computational resources and time.
There are different levels of fine-tuning. Some approaches adjust only the final layers of the neural network (known as feature extraction), while others allow all layers to be updated (full fine-tuning). Techniques like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), are gaining popularity, especially for large language models, because they minimize the number of parameters updated.
Fine-tuning is used in a variety of real-world applications, including chatbots, image generation, fraud detection, and more. It’s especially powerful in scenarios where labeled data is limited but high-quality outputs are essential. With the growth of open-source and pre-trained foundation models, fine-tuning has become a key skill for AI practitioners.
To master techniques like fine-tuning, transfer learning, and prompt engineering, enrolling in a Generative AI certification course is highly recommended.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
We introduce a novel numerical method, ExpRoot+Log, for function approximation based on a hybrid linear basis consisting of exponential-square-root, polynomial, and logarithmic components. This method achieves high accuracy across smooth, discontinuous, and rapidly decaying functions while remaining simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient. We show that ExpRoot+Log outperforms classical approaches such as polynomials, splines, Fourier series, and even neural networks in key scenarios, offering a new universal baseline for practical approximation.
Introduction
Function approximation is fundamental to numerical analysis, physics, machine learning, and signal processing. Classical bases—polynomials, splines, and trigonometric functions—have known limitations, especially near discontinuities or exponential decays. While neural networks provide expressive power, they are complex, opaque, and computationally expensive.
We propose a new hybrid basis:

This composition handles:

All coefficients are learned linearly (e.g., via least-squares), ensuring ultra-fast performance and excellent stability.

Numerical Evaluation
We tested ExpRoot+Log against standard methods (polynomials, splines, Fourier) across six function types:
Sine
Exponential decay
Step function
Gaussian spike
Absolute value
Composite (piecewise mix)

ExpRoot+Log consistently achieved 1–4 orders of magnitude lower error than polynomials or Fourier bases.
Comparison with Classical Methods

In system design, access control is a critical mechanism to ensure data security and correct authorization of functionalities. Depending on the complexity of the system, the variety of user roles, and the flexibility needed in resource management, there are three common access control models: ACL (Access Control List), RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control). Below is a brief comparison of these three models, outlining their design logic, characteristics, and application scenarios to help clarify the selection and implementation considerations.

With the theme “Celebrating 20 Years of Arduino and Open Source Innovation,” this year’s event became more than just a commemoration—it was a powerful reflection of how far the local tech community has come and where it’s headed next.
The event opened with warm welcomes from Marvin James Erosa and Jeferson De Leon, immediately setting a collaborative tone for the day. And in true Filipino fashion, a surprise Zumba icebreaker added the perfect energy boost to kick things off.

When developing an application that requires seamless data exchange between C# and PHP, maintaining character integrity is crucial. If you've encountered issues where characters like 'é' appear as 'Ã©' after data transfer, you're likely facing a character encoding problem. This article will guide you through understanding character encoding and how to resolve these issues effectively.
Understanding Character Encoding Issues
Character encoding is essential for correctly displaying and processing text data. In your case, both the C# application and the PHP server are set to use UTF-8, but inconsistencies can arise during data transfers. This usually occurs when data is transformed in a way that misinterprets the byte sequences of special characters, leading to the corruption of …]]></summary>

And within 2 hours?
Most Job Posts Are Noise
Vague requirements
Tools thrown in without context
Unrealistic experience levels (10 years of Cypress? Sure.)
Zero clue what kind of thinking the role actually needs
I didn't want that. So I stripped it down and wrote it like I write tests: clear, intentional, and designed to reveal behavior.
I ended the post with a line that acted like a trapdoor:
“Want in? Send your resume and a short note on how you found your worst bug to hi@proudcloud.io.”
That was the test.
If you missed it, you failed silently.
The Best Testers Didn’t Just Apply. They Investigated.
But a smaller group took the time, wrote thoughtful bug stories, and sent real applications to the email provided. And those were the ones I called in for interviews.
Some of the best candidates I’ve ever spoken to came from that post.
Sound familiar?
This Isn’t Just About Hiring
The way you write a bug report.
The way you name a test.
The way you respond when something feels off, even if the build says "green."
QA is never just about tools. It's about how you think.
The Full Breakdown
What the full post looked like
How the interviews went
What our actual QA hiring process is like
And why I believe job posts are a mirror of team quality…

When working with integration tests in .NET 8, especially when utilizing secrets such as clientId and clientSecret, many developers face issues of empty secret values during pipeline execution. This common problem typically arises in environments like Azure DevOps where secrets must be correctly configured and utilized in the pipeline.
Understanding the Problem
In your scenario, it seems the Azure DevOps pipeline does not recognize the secrets added to the library asset group, leading to the variables clientId and clientSecret being empty. This can happen due to various reasons such as misconfiguration of variable groups, permissions, or pipeline setup. Let’s break down the potential issues and guide you through resolving them.

Imagine walking into an engineering department three years from now. The highest-performing teams will be defined by the proprietary AI systems they've built, customized for their specific codebases, architectural patterns, and business domains. These teams will wield AI as a strategic differentiator, not merely consume it.
This is where our industry is clearly headed. As AI increasingly becomes the primary author of code across industries, the strategic advantage will shift from who can write the best code to who can best direct, customize, and optimize AI systems to write that code.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked in several agile teams as both a developer and lead developer. One particular project sticks in my mind — a team of ten people, dozens of microservices, and a lot of GitLab repositories to manage.
During each sprint, we were juggling features across multiple repos. At the same time, we were responsible for reviewing each other’s code. Our typical flow was:
Open a merge request (MR) on GitLab
Move the related Jira ticket
Share the MR link in a Teams channel
Move on to the next story
When the workload was light, it was manageable. But in busy sprints, reviews piled up quickly. Large MRs got ignored, or rushed through. And tracking what was waiting, what was blocked, or what still needed input? A mess.
We experimented with several ideas:
Using GitLab labels like needs-review or blocked
Adding Jira tags
Rotating reviewer ownership by repo each sprint
They helped — but they didn’t solve the root problem: lack of visibility and timing.
Code reviews were often asynchronous and scattered. We were switching contexts constantly, jumping between repos, and forgetting which contributions needed our attention.
We didn’t need more tools — we needed a better way to surface and track reviews. Something that would:
Give us a unified view of MRs
Let us know what’s ready to merge, what’s waiting, and what’s blocked
Respect our flow, instead of interrupting it
That’s when I started working on a side project, aiming to solve this specific pain point.
That side project became Bellugo — a contribution tracker designed to help teams stay on top of reviews across repositories without the chaos.
It’s still a work in progress, but if this resonates with your team, I’d love for you to check out the landing page and maybe join the private beta waitlist.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're looking to streamline your HTML documents by replacing empty anchor (<a>) tags with text indicators based on their unique page IDs, you're in the right place. This is a common scenario in web development where removing or replacing tags can enhance readability and maintainability. In this article, we will use Bash commands with regular expressions to achieve this.
Understanding the Problem
In your HTML files, you may come across instances of empty <a> tags that serve as placeholders. For example:
<a id="page_123" class="garbage1"></a> some text <a id="page_124" class="garbage2"></a>

Your goal is to replace these tags with:
<a id="page_123" class="pagenum">123</a> some text <a id="page_124" class="pagenum">124</a>

The new tags will display the page IDs (without the 'page_' prefi…]]></summary>

After several painful sprints, we implemented five changes to our testing approach that dramatically reduced our testing time without compromising quality. I'm sharing these because they've been game-changers for us, and they might help your team too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🎯 Learning Goals



What are the characteristics of Singly Linked Lists?
What are its time complexities?
ListNode?



Has a value and a next pointer



next is a reference to another ListNode






Order in memory may not be contiguous (unlike arrays which are)
Simple while loop with a current pointer can be used:
cur = ListNode1
while cur:
    cur = cur.next

⌚ Time complexity is O(n) , where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
Now if the Linked List is circular (i.e. last node points back to first) traversing like this would cause an infinite loop.
It would be helpful if we’re keeping track of the head and the tail of the linked list using pointers
Advantage over array is that inserting is always O(1) even if we insert in middle.
Let’s say we wanna add at the end or tail :
tail.next = NewListNode
tail = NewListNode
# or this line 'tail = tail.next', both are correct

⌚ Time complexity is O(1) 
Removing any node is constant time ASSUMING we have a pointer to the previous node.
Let’s say we wanna remove the second node:
head.next = head.next.next
# Just set the next pointer of head to the one after the deleted node

Can be assumed that garbage collection will take place for the deleted node
⌚ Time complexity is O(1) 
For both of these operations, the caveat is if we don’t have a reference to the node at the desired position (head or tail), the time will still be O(n)



Operation
Big-O




Reading/ Access
O(n)


Traversal/ Search
O(n)


Insertion
O(1)*


Deletion
O(1)*



*Assumes you have a reference to the node at the position (if not it is O(n) )

A schematic diagram is a graphical representation of an electronic circuit.

It shows how components like resistors, capacitors, ICs, and connectors are connected on the board.
Helps in diagnosing hardware issues
Saves time in troubleshooting
Improves your understanding of board-level repair
GND (Ground): Usually marked with a downward triangle


VCC / VBAT: Main power lines


Resistor (R), Capacitor (C), Inductor (L)


U, Q, D labels: Indicate ICs, transistors, diodes
Start from the battery input, trace the voltage line, check for filters or protection ICs, and identify where the current flow might be interrupted.
Use a multimeter alongside the schematic to test continuity and voltage levels on each section of the board.

In this article, we will explore how to write a SELECT SQL query in Oracle 19c to identify the latest account numbers from specific groups based on the previous account numbers. This technique can be beneficial when managing hierarchical data structures where records are interconnected through identifiers. By utilizing SQL, we can efficiently retrieve the latest entries for each group from a dataset.
Understanding the Data Structure
The given dataset consists of two columns: Account Number and Previous Number. The Account Number represents the current identifier, while the Previous Number indicates the preceding account number in the group hierarchy. With this structure, we can determine the latest account number for each defined group.

In mid-April, I blogged about leveraging cloud and generative AI to maximize developer productivity. Among other areas, I highlighted the potential of AI in the PR Review/Gitflow process, suggesting tools like Evolua.io or CodeRabbit to offload routine code reviews and low-value fixes to AI assistants.
Today, I'm excited to explore Amazon's latest offering in this space: Amazon Q Developer in GitHub, which has just been released in preview. As an AWS Community Builder, I've had early access to this tool for over a week, and I wanted to put it through its paces with a real-world test: 
Can Amazon Q Developer build a complete AWS SAM application from scratch, based solely on requirements provided in GitHub issues?
Before diving into my experiment, let's quickly review how Amaz…]]></summary>

Every morning, we grab our phones and open a weather app. But ever since I started my 30-day Linux challenge, I’ve been doing it differently.
terminal. Yes, the terminal!
if you need an umbrella. 
🔹 What You’ll Learn:
Check the weather using curl and wttr.in

Customize output
Add an alias for quick access
🔹 Step-by-Step Tutorial (With Code Blocks)
Let’s get into how you can check the weather right from your Linux terminal. No weather apps, no browser — just pure terminal magic. 🧙‍♂️⚡
✅ Step 1: Open Your Terminal
You can open it by pressing:

✅ Step 2: Use curl with wttr.in
This command shows you the weather forecast in your current city using the terminal:

✅ Step 3: Check Weather for a Specific City
Want to check the weather in Delhi, UK, or USA? Just add the city name:


✅ Step 4: Customize the Output

🎯 Metric Units (Celsius)

🧼 No ASCII Graphics (Plain Output)

✅ Step 5: Create a Weather Shortcut (Alias)
Want to type weather instead of writing the full command every time?
.bashrc or .zshrc file. In my Case, I'm using .zshrc file. 
Edit your .zshrc file with nano ~/.zshrc.

Add the alias to .zshrc with alias weather="curl wttr.in"

Save and exit the editor




Press Ctrl + X to exit.
Press Y to confirm changes.
Press Enter to save the file.

To write something in the terminal or display text, you can use commands like:
echo: For printing messages.
cat >: To write multiple lines into a file.
nano: For directly editing files in the terminal.
tee: For displaying text and saving it to a file simultaneously.
These simple commands let you write, edit, and manage text efficiently from the terminal.

Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.

When compiling programs in C or C++ using cc or c++, you may find yourself needing to use a different linker than the default one. For instance, your version of GCC or Clang might link against /usr/bin/ld. In many scenarios, developers want to test their applications with alternative linkers, like /usr/local/bin/ld, for various reasons, including performance evaluation or compatibility testing. In this article, we’ll explore how to specify a different linker without running separate compilation steps.
Why the Default Linker Matters
The linker plays a crucial role in the compilation process, as it's responsible for combining different object files into a single executable. By default, compilers like GCC and Clang use a hard-coded linker, typically located at /usr/bin/ld on Unix…]]></summary>

In our era, the cloud is the haute couture of infrastructure. Everyone wants it. Everyone says you need it. And few ask whether it actually fits.
This post is for those who remember that not every problem needs 12 layers of abstraction. It's for careful builders who believe that owning your tools is better than renting your soul.
And here are 12 reasons why on-premise will outlast the hype.
The cloud sells convenience, but charges premium rent, forever. When you buy servers, you own an asset. When you rent a VM, you feed a meter. The cloud is like living in a hotel room and bragging you don’t have to fix the faucet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Devs, I’m Harrison G Herdzik — a full-time tech student at Western Connecticut State University and founder of Harrison’s Tech Solutions, a small business offering practical IT support for local clients.
Balancing academics, client requests, and business admin might sound chaotic, but I’ve developed a lightweight but effective workflow that keeps me sane and productive.
Here’s how I do it — and how you can adapt it to your own side-hustle or service-based business.
🧰 My Tech Stack for Client Management
CRM & Task Tracking: Notion
Scheduling & Booking: Calendly
Remote Support: AnyDesk
Invoicing: Wave
Communication: Gmail + Google Meet
Documentation: Google Docs + Loom for quick video walkthroughs
Each tool solves a specific problem. The goal isn’t complexity — it’s clarity and control.
**💬 How I Communicate With Clients
*Here’s my approach:

Keep emails concise but informative
Use screen recordings (Loom) when words fall short
Set clear expectations and timelines from the start
Document every service — even one-off calls
That’s something I learned early on: people appreciate clarity, not cleverness.
**⏱️ Time Management as a Student & Founder
⏰** Morning:** Classwork, assignments
💻 Afternoon: Scheduled client calls or remote work
📑 Evening: Admin tasks, follow-ups, learning new tech tools
By blocking time and batching tasks, I reduce context switching. And if a client emergency comes up? I leave a 1-hour buffer each day just in case.
🚀 Advice from Harrison Herdzik to Aspiring Student Founders
 Your first client might be a family friend — that’s okay.
Document your work. It builds trust and repeat business.
Say no to bad fits. Focus on clients you can genuinely help.
Keep learning. The tech world changes fast — be ready.
Whether you’re offering dev services, IT help, or consulting — your time, your tools, and your tone all matter.]]></summary>

If you've ever tried to implement a modal that slides in from the bottom after being triggered by a button, you might have encountered an unexpected behavior when using a <button> element inside your modal dialog. This is a common issue that developers face, especially when working with CSS animations. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and how you can fix it effectively.
Why Does This Happen?
The problem often arises from the way CSS handles layout changes during animations. When the modal is opened, if a button element is included, it may trigger a reflow in the browser’s layout engine. This reflow can result in the appearance of a scrollbar, which disrupts the fluidity of your animation. The pointer-events property combin…]]></summary>

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”
The SEC issued a Wells notice — a formal notification that is often a precursor to enforcement action — to OpenSea in 2024, alleging that the NFT marketplace was operating as an exchange for unregistered securities. At the time, Finz…]]></summary>

Isso é ineficiente.

A solução? debounce()
debounce?


É uma técnica usada para adiar a execução de uma função até que um tempo específico tenha passado sem novas chamadas.
É muito usado em:
buscas dinâmicas (auto-complete)
eventos de rolagem (scroll)
eventos de resize
Imagine um campo de busca que chama a API a cada tecla:
function search(term) {
  fetch(`https://api.exemplo.com/search?q=${term}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(console.log);
}

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  search(e.target.value);
});

Isso gera chamadas demais.
Agora, com debounce:
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
}

const debouncedSearch = debounce(search, 500);

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  debouncedSearch(e.target.value);
});

Agora só é chamada a API depois que o usuário parar de digitar por 500ms.
No React, pode usar com useCallback ou bibliotecas como lodash.debounce:
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';

const debounced = useCallback(
  debounce((value) => {
    // chamada de API aqui
  }, 300),
  []
);

If you're working with Hibernate and querying a DB2 z/OS database, you might have faced a common issue where the generated SQL queries include unnecessary cast statements, especially after upgrading to Hibernate 6. This can cause errors as certain DB2 versions don't support those casts. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and provide solutions to remove the cast statements for compatibility with DB2 z/OS.
Understanding the Problem
In Hibernate, SQL query generation can change between versions due to changes in how Hibernate handles type conversions. After upgrading to Hibernate 6, many users report encountering errors like:
Could not convert 'java.lang.Character' to 'java.lang.String' using 'org.hibernate.type.descriptor.java.StringJavaType' to wrap

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with deeply nested arrays in Laravel, especially when handling configuration files, API responses, or multidimensional data structures, managing or accessing values quickly becomes complex. Laravel’s Arr::dot() method offers a clean, efficient way to flatten these arrays using “dot” notation, making them much easier to work with.
In this article, we’ll explore what Arr::dot() does, how it works, and when you might want to use it.
The Arr::dot() method in Laravel flattens a multidimensional array into a single-level array using dot notation for keys. This transformation allows you to access deeply nested values with a simple key string.
Arr::dot(array $array, string $prepend = '')
$prepend: (Optional) A string to prefix each key in the final array.
This method is part of Laravel’s Illuminate\Support\Arr helper class.
Let’s take a look at a typical example:
Input Array
$data = [

Applying Arr::dot()
$flattened = Arr::dot($data);
print_r($flattened);
[
    'user.name' => 'John',
1. Configuration Files
2. Localization
3. Form Handling
Bonus: Reversing the Flattening
$nested = Arr::undot($flattened);
Arr::dot() is a small but powerful utility in Laravel that simplifies the handling of complex arrays. Whether you're building APIs, working with config files, or cleaning up nested data structures, this helper can be a time-saver and make your code cleaner and more readable.
Next time you're faced with a deeply nested array, consider reaching for Arr::dot() — you’ll appreciate the simplicity it brings.]]></summary>

Sizable purchases by Strategy and the spot BTC ETFs highlight institutional investors’ appetite for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by 4.3% in the last three days after nearly reaching $97,900 on May 2. Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.

Docker quietly builds a tiny virtual world behind the scenes — with bridges, fake Ethernet cables (veth), and routing tables. In this post, we'll walk through how Docker’s default bridge network actually works, using a diagram-based example. Ready? Let’s go! 👇
When you run:
docker run -d nginx

Docker places your container on a network called bridge (unless you tell it otherwise). This bridge is a virtual switch inside your host.
Your container:
Gets its own virtual Ethernet interface

Talks to other containers via the bridge
Reaches the outside world via NAT routing



Let’s break this down visually.

  Historical and Technical Context


The emergence of web technologies has ushered in a new era of interactivity and real-time applications. However, with such capabilities comes the critical responsibility of user privacy and consent. The Permissions API was standardized as part of the broader movement to provide enhanced privacy practices on the web, enabling developers to manage user permissions more systematically.
The Permissions API was introduced to address the concerns posed by previous blind consent models, which often left users unaware of the degree of access they were granting. Traditionally, permissions like location access, notifications, and camera/microphone use were either all-or-nothing, l…]]></summary>

If you're experiencing slow load times with your current method—where each page requires a new HTTP request—you might want to consider converting your form into a Single Page Application (SPA). This approach enhances user experience by loading the HTML just once and using JavaScript to handle navigation smoothly.
Understanding the Issue
When using multiple pages for form registration, each time a user clicks the 'Next' button, a new HTTP request is sent to the server, which loads a new page. This results in a complete refresh, including reloading CSS, JavaScript, and images, leading to inefficient use of resources and slow loading speeds. A Single Page Application a…]]></summary>

So I went to https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird checked out the code and build it on WSL2 Windows 11, took around 3 hours to compile and finally it worked

UI looks similar to Firefox and feels like #Netscape in 1999, and it is developed actively, I hope we have a new and free browser because feels like Firefox is not that free anymore and Google has been too strong on browser market, it would be nice to have a real non-profit browser here. Maybe government/countries should support this kind of organizations otherwise browsers or OSes becoming like citizen monitoring tools and used for profit and manipulation, After we say internet is a human right that human should have the option of non monitored communication use in their home.
And in the YouTube video Andreas talks about SerenityOS which looks very similar to Windows 95, good old days. It is a good idea to have unix like OS as desktop. But remember this year is the Linux desktop year :D

Perfect Fit for Your Needs
Custom libraries can be designed specifically for your project's requirements
No unnecessary features or bloat that comes with generic solutions
Ability to make architectural decisions that align perfectly with your stack

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Em janeiro, decidi tirar minha ideia de SaaS do papel. O objetivo? Aprender na prática como levar um produto do conceito à loja. Confesso que foi uma onda de desafios (e ainda está sendo!).  
Como era meu primeiro projeto, cometi vários equívocos. Eu queria compartilhar alguns abaixo ⤵️ — e como eles estão me ajudando a evoluir:
🔥 Planejamento impulsivo  
Fui direto da ideia para a solução, sem mapear etapas ou prazos. Resultado? Retrabalho e ansiedade. Hoje, priorizo ferramentas de gerenciamento e cronogramas flexíveis para manter o foco sem engessar a criatividade. 
🔍 Validação superficial  
Criei o SaaS para resolver meu problema, mas não validei se era uma dor real do mercado. Consequência? Perdi tempo competindo com soluções já consolidadas. Aprendi que entrevistas com potenciais usuários são tão importantes quanto o código.
💸 Precificação "no feeling"  
Foquei em funcionalidades incríveis, mas não pensei em como monetizá-las de forma atraente. Lição? Agora estudo modelos de precificação antes de sair desenvolvendo novas features, usando cases de sucesso como referência.
✨ O saldo positivo?  
Esses tropeços me deram algo valioso: clareza. Hoje entendo melhor que errar faz parte do processo — desde que cada erro vire um degrau para iterar.
E você? Já passou por situações assim em seus projetos?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the DevOps landscape evolves, tracking the right KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) becomes more than a performance metric it becomes a strategy for continuous improvement, team alignment, and business value delivery.
In 2025, DevOps is not just about shipping code faster. It's about delivering resilient, scalable, and secure systems while maintaining harmony across development and operations.
Here’s a look at the most relevant KPIs DevOps teams should track in 2025 to ensure performance, productivity, and reliability are all on target.
Deployment Frequency
Why it matters: This KPI measures how often you deploy code to production. High-performing DevOps teams typically deploy multiple times per day.
How to improve:
•Automate CI/CD pipelines
•Embrace feature flags and trunk-based development
•Encourage smaller, incremental releases
Pro tip: Pair this metric with Change Failure Rate to ensure quality isn't sacrificed for speed.
Lead Time for Changes


Change Failure Rate (CFR)


Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)


System Uptime & Availability


Developer Productivity


Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Coverage


Security Scan Success Rate

There are plenty of GAEB software tools available, but almost all of them are Windows-only or commercial. Linux users in the construction industry currently have no solid open-source solution to handle GAEB files.
The goal is to create an open-source GAEB file viewer/editor for Linux (written in Java for cross-platform compatibility). The initial version will support:
Viewing GAEB XML files (e.g., .X83, .X84),


Entering bid data and prices for tenders,


Later stages could include additional features like full AVA (tendering and invoicing) functionality.




  
  
  🌱 Current Status:


Right now, I’m in the early planning phase – no code has been written yet. I’m designing the system, figuring out the core features, and planning how to integrate the GAEB XML structure.
Developers familiar with Java, XML, and GUI design (Swing/JavaFX, etc.),


Anyone with experience in the construction industry or knowledge of GAEB/AVA workflows,


Designers or UX/UI specialists who can help build an intuitive interface,


Feedback from anyone who has worked with GAEB or similar standards.



I’m planning to host the project on GitLab, and I’ll set up a chat (Discord/Matrix) for discussions and collaboration.
Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions, and I’m open to any tips from anyone who has experience with GAEB file handling.
Thanks for reading!

  The Hard Numbers





# 2025 SGE Impact Data
traffic_drop = 42  # Percentage decrease
queries_affected = 68  # Percentage of searches

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've spent time working with JavaScript's asynchronous model, you know that its single-threaded nature is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, you don't have to worry about complex locking mechanisms. On the other, you might stumble into weird issues where your code just... never runs. One such issue is starvation.
In the context of JavaScript, starvation refers to a situation where a task is perpetually delayed because the event loop is constantly busy with other tasks—usually of higher priority or those scheduled more frequently.
Since JavaScript executes code in a single-threaded environment using an event loop, starvation can occur when:
Long-running synchronous code blocks the event loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR:

LLMs are great, but they’re not your safety net. Please, for the love of all things holy, test your code. 
We’re in the golden age of vibe coding. LLMs scaffold our code, fix our syntax, and fill in the blanks. We’re thinking more about architecture and less about syntax—and that’s great.
But in all this abstraction, we sometimes skip something essential: testing.
AI doesn’t run your code. It doesn't know if that method exists, if that call will throw an error, or if that edge case breaks everything. It’s bluffing with confidence.
You can’t vibe your way through correctness. You need tests to know your code behaves the way you think it does.
🛡 Confidence to refactor without fear

🧠 Clarity around what your code is supposed to do

🔄 Continuity when you revisit the code 6 months later

🤝 Collaboration with teammates who now understand the logic
A mentor once told me:
“Start at the center—your happy case. Then go left, right, and fall off the line.”
Say your function expects a positive integer. Start with 42.
Then try:
0, -1, Infinity, -Infinity

A string ("hello"), a float (3.14), or null



Now take it further:
What if the parameters are undefined?
What if the database call fails?
What if the API returns malformed or missing data?
What if a field you depend on is null?
The real world is messy. Your tests should be ready for that.
As we stop writing every line ourselves, we need to start questioning every line more. AI will get you to “working”—but testing gets you to “works when it matters.”
AI bluffs. Don’t let it bluff you into a broken release.]]></summary>

In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

Hasta hace relativamente poco tiempo he usado W4D como entorno de desarrollo en mis proyectos, pero hace un año me tocó probar Ddev para un proyecto y desde entonces me enamoré de todo lo que aporta este software.
Ahora toca migrar proyectos que tengo con W4D a Ddev y una de las cosas que toca migrar es Grumphp.
Para instalar Grumphp yo uso el paquete de Carcheky que está preparado para funcionar con Drupal y luego lo personalizo.
Ejecuto el siguiente código para instalar el paquete:
composer config extra.grumphp --json '{"config-default-path": "vendor/carcheky/drupal-grumphp/configs/grumphp.yml"}' ;
composer require --dev carcheky/drupal-grumphp -W

Una vez instalado copio el archivo grumphp.yml que se encuentra en 
vendor/carcheky/drupal-grumphp/configs/grumphp.yml a la misma altura del archivo composer.json
En el archvio composer.json busco la configuración de grumphp y actualizo config-default-path de la siguiente manera:
        "grumphp": {
            "config-default-path": "grumphp.yml"
        }

En el archivo grumphp.yml que hemos copiado a la raíz del proyecto buscamos la configuraciónde git_hook_variable y lo actualizamos de la siguiente manera:
  git_hook_variables:
    EXEC_GRUMPHP_COMMAND: ddev exec php

Por último en la consola ejecuto el siguiente comando para actualizar la configuración del hook pre-commit
ddev exec grumphp git:init

De esta forma actualizaremos el hook pre-commit de nuestro proyecto (los hooks pre-commit están en la ruta '/.git/hooks/pre-commit`y el archivo queda así:
`bash
DIFF=$(git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c diff.noprefix=false --no-pager diff -r -p -m -M --full-index --no-color --staged | cat)
export GRUMPHP_GIT_WORKING_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
(cd "./" && printf "%s\n" "${DIFF}" | ddev exec php 'vendor/bin/grumphp' 'git:pre-commit' '--skip-success-output')

This devblog is my honest take on helping you understand the Builder Pattern—the way I wish someone had explained it to me.
The Builder Pattern helps construct complex objects step by step.
In simple terms: You control the construction process, one method at a time.
You might be looking at a Builder Pattern if you see:
A class with many constructor parameters (some optional).
Code like:
IUser user = new User.Builder().setName("Alice").setAge(30).build();

A nested static Builder class or a separate builder class that returns the same object.

The React compiler is one of the biggest updates to the React framework in years. Last year, the React team released a beta version. Around that time, I wrote an article called “Exploring React's Compiler: A Detailed Introduction”. 
It unpacked the core idea behind the compiler and showed how it could improve React development by automatically handling performance issues behind the scenes. When the beta dropped, the React team encouraged developers to try it out, give feedback, and contribute. And many did. A standout example is Sanity Studio. They used the compiler internally and shipped libraries like react-rx and @sanity/ui that are optimized for it.

  Chapter 5: Cross-Functional Teamwork Done Right


Being a product manager means wearing many hats, but it never means working alone.

The success of your product depends on how well you collaborate with designers, developers, QA, marketing, and more.
In this chapter, we’ll break down what cross-functional collaboration looks like when it’s done right and how you can foster it on your team.
Great PMs don’t just coordinate. They listen, learn, and empathize with every function.

Understanding the goals and constraints of each role builds trust and leads to better decisions.
Example:

Your designer is pushing back on adding another button to a crowded screen.

Instead of insisting, you ask about the visual hierarchy and UX implications.

Choosing how and where to store that data in the cloud is one of the most fundamental – and often confusing – decisions architects and developers face. Pick the wrong type, and you could end up with slow performance, skyrocketing costs, or an architecture that just doesn't scale.

CTags (short for "C Tags") is a tool that scans your code and generates an index of where functions, variables, classes, and other identifiers are defined. This index is saved in a file called tags.
Suppose you have this simple math_utils.py file:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

Run this in your terminal:

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

My friend had just executed his code — and it worked perfectly.
So what happened?
He had to log into Gmail on the lab PC
That’s when I had this thought:
Googled and found already existing ones like dontpad
So, for the next couple of weeks, all of us started using dontpad — mostly just copy-pasting code, sharing it as soon as someone got it working. Whoever cracked the problem first would dump the code there, and the rest of us would just grab it and run.
Then one day, I was sitting in class and noticed how our teacher logged into her Gmail just to download a PPT and present it to the class. That moment stuck in my mind — but I got busy with other things and didn’t think much of it.

This guide shows you how to get AI answers *instantly by streaming LLM responses word-by-word, and cut them off anytime, using a simple PocketFlow LLM Streaming Example.*
We've all been there. You ask an AI a question. You wait. Maybe it's brilliant, maybe it's... weird. What if you could see the answer appear as it's typed and hit an "eject" button if it's not what you want?
That's LLM Streaming (seeing it live) and User Interruption (hitting stop). Instead of getting a whole essay dropped on you, text pops up piece by piece. It feels way faster. Plus, the stop button puts you in charge, saving time and maybe even cash on API calls.

Nah, data yang masuk ini nggak bisa langsung kita percaya gitu aja. Sebelum diproses atau dilempar ke database, kita wajib pastiin dulu datanya itu valid, lengkap, dan formatnya sesuai sama yang kita harapkan.
Proses ini, ya kalian udah tau lah, namanya Validasi Data.

Vendor downtime seldom triggers your own uptime probes—the traffic never reaches you. IsDown closes that gap by checking hundreds of official status pages round the clock. When those signals land inside Better Stack, responders work from a single incident list. No tab-hopping, no split workflows.

What is data? 
Data, in its simplest form, is raw, unprocessed facts and figures. It can be numbers, text, images, or any other form of information that can be stored and processed by computers. Data becomes meaningful information when it is analyzed, interpreted, and placed in context. Therefore, Data is the basic unit of information before it's been organized, analyzed, or interpreted. 
What is information?
In data science, splitting your dataset effectively is an important initial step towards building a robust model. Generally, you'll want to allocate a larger portion of your data for training, very often around 70%-80%, with the remaining 20%-30% for testing. This allows the model to learn from a substantial amount of data while still retaining enough unique data points to test …]]></summary>

TypeScript is a robust, statically-typed programming language designed as a superset of JavaScript. Simply put, it enhances JavaScript by adding type definitions (a way to explicitly define the type of values) and other powerful features like interfaces, enums, and decorators. This makes it easier to work with larger codebases and prevent runtime errors by catching issues during the compile time. 
For those just starting out, think of TypeScript as a tool that adds structure and safety to JavaScript without changing its core nature. If you're building complex applications or working in a collaborative team, TypeScript helps make your code predictable, maintainable, and scalable.

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Weakening US dollar and rising global liquidity remain key drivers for both assets.

Gold’s march toward $5,000 per ounce and beyond has become a big topic among hard-asset bulls, including Yardeni Research’s head Ed Yardeni and billionaire investor John Paulson. 
But what could happen to the price of Bitcoin (BTC), touted as “digital gold” by many, if the precious metal surges even higher?

Java compiler doesn't force exhaustiveness in switch statements, whereas switch expression are expected to be exhaustive. What really is exhaustiveness? Exhaustiveness ensures that all possible cases are handled in a switch expression, either explicitly or with a default case. For example, When you use an enum type, switch must cover different values of the enum. This is not limited to enums, its applicable to all the types switch supports. Look at the below versions of code, former one with switch statement and the later with switch expressions.

They connect your systems, enabling you to scale through integration and automation and deliver superior customer experiences. But what’s often overlooked is that APIs are only as reliable as your ability to test them effectively. Unlike traditional UI testing, which focuses on the frontend layer, testing them gives you visibility into the actual mechanics of your app—the business logic, the rules that drive decisions, and the integrations that connect your systems. If you don’t validate that layer thoroughly, you leave core functionality exposed, increasing security risk.

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

Whether you're automating a deployment or writing a bash script to clean up temp files, there's one thing your future self will always thank you for: clear, timestamped, consistent logging.

Shell scripts often get the job done fast — but when they go wrong, debugging them can feel like trying to read hieroglyphics in the dark. Logging provides a flashlight. It tells you what ran, when it ran, and how it ran — especially when you're not watching.
This post walks you through a compact, reusable logger function for your shell scripts that:
Categorizes messages by severity (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, etc.)
Automatically timestamps log entries
Writes to a dedicated log file

Now imagine someone asks the toddler to also solve a big puzzle. If the toddler starts working on it alone, they’ll stop playing with their other toys until it’s done. This is similar to how Node.js blocks the event loop during a heavy task.
Bringing in the Siblings – The Child Processes
Technical View
const { fork } = require('child_process');
const child = fork('heavyTask.js');

child.on('message', (msg) => {

});

child.send({ task: 'start' });

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said "teachers are going the extra mile for their students' education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms." The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.
Ripple cites a 2024 Gallup survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights “constraints and gaps in funding for education,” the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:
“We hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.”
Teach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its “Ignite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance” to prepare teachers.

Crypto-fueled charity
The cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.
Another player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Upgrading an application to .NET Core 3 often brings a variety of enhancements, one of which is the option to publish a single-file executable. While this has its advantages, many developers encounter path-related issues during the build process, particularly related to the PublishSingleFile flag. This article addresses a common problem where the executable path defaults to a temporary directory, disrupting access to vital resources.
Understanding the Issue
When you set the PublishSingleFile flag, the .NET runtime modifies how executable paths are resolved. Instead of locating the executable file in its original directory, it often redirects to a location like /var/tmp/.net/. This behavior occurs due to the way the runtime handles unpacking the single-file executable at runtim…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exceptions in Java are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution. They are used to handle errors and other exceptional events that may occur during runtime.
Checked Exceptions (compile-time exceptions)
Must be declared or handled (using try-catch or throws)
Examples: IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException




Unchecked Exceptions (runtime exceptions)
Not checked at compile time
Examples: NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException




Errors
Serious problems that applications should not try to catch
Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError






  
  
  Exception Handling Keywords




try: Block of code to monitor for exceptions
catch: Block that handles the exception
finally: Block that always executes (for cleanup)
throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception
throws: Declares exceptions that might be thrown by a method
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("General exception caught");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This will always execute");
}

You can create your own exception classes by extending Exception (checked) or RuntimeException (unchecked):
class MyCustomException extends Exception {
    public MyCustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

Catch specific exceptions rather than general Exception
Don't ignore caught exceptions (empty catch blocks)
Use finally blocks for resource cleanup
Document exceptions with @throws in JavaDoc
Consider whether to handle, propagate, or convert exceptions

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.

chat with your favorite books like you're texting a friend? 📖💬
BookChatBot, an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions about a book, using:
🧠 LangChain (for LLM logic)
🌲 Pinecone (for vector search)
🧾 PDF loading and splitting
⚡ Google Gemini (for answering questions)
🧪 Flask (as the web framework)
You can find the full code on GitHub:
GitHub Repo
We're building a chatbot web app that can read PDFs (like a book 📘), store them in Pinecone’s vector database, and allow users to ask questions about the content!
Google's Gemini model.
💸 Note: Pinecone’s free tier only allows one index. So for now, you can't dynamically upload new books — but once set up, it's super efficient for Q&A!

Either its because the rest of the family is still sleeping in during the morning or to just sit with the laptop next to the kids while they look a Christmas movie. 
During recent years end period there was a lot of excitement about the deepseek model, released open source, so i decided to give it a try to run local.
First setting up the environment. From my ethical hacker lab I was already used of using oracle box (with Kali), so I continued in that space.
https://dev.to/pavanbelagatti/run-deepseek-r1-locally-for-free-in-just-3-minutes-1e82
Setting up went fast, although there where as usual some extra libraries to upgrade. Also made the rookie mistake to give the VM insufficient disc space :-D 
First impression: slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow but also what a fun to use! 
Planned three homelabs as follow-up:
Using python scripts to call the local LLM (update May: done, see next blog post)
Play around with different LLMs to measure performance

Behind the flashy keynotes about "innovation" and "disruption," a silent crisis is raging: burnout is now the default, not the exception. This isn’t another "work-life balance" lecture. This is about why 40% of senior devs are planning exit strategies by 2026 (2025 Stack Overflow Mental Health Survey), and what we’re really losing when they walk away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've worked with React or JavaScript modules, you might have noticed that sometimes you write imports with curly braces ({}) and sometimes without them. Ever wondered why?
Let’s break it down.
A default export allows a module to export a single value. It’s useful when your file exports just one main thing — like a component.
// components/Footer.jsx
export default function Footer() {
  return <footer>...</footer>;
}


import Footer from './components/Footer';


🚫 No curly braces needed for default exports.
A named export allows you to export multiple values from a file. You must import them using curly braces.
// components/Contact.tsx
export function Contact() { ... }
export function AnotherHelper() { ... }


import { Contact } from './components/Contact';


✅ Curly braces required for named exports.

You can combine both in one file:
export default function App() { ... }
export function Helper() { ... }


Then import like:
import App, { Helper } from './App';


Hope this clears up the mystery behind those curly braces!

This issue typically arises when output is sent to the browser before PHP attempts to modify the session. Let's dive into the causes and solutions for this common problem, ensuring your Yii application runs smoothly on the new server.
Understanding the Warning
The warning signifies that some output was sent to the browser before your PHP script tried to refresh the session. This can often happen if there are unexpected characters or whitespace before the opening <?php tag or after the closing ?> tag in your PHP files. Other causes can include echo or print statements executed before session manipulation.

MVC stands for Model View Controller, which is an abbreviation for model-view-controller. It is a widely applied software design paradigm. Its core idea is to organize the code by separating the business logic, data, and interface display, and centralize the business logic in one component. In this way, when improving and customizing the interface and user interaction, there is no need to rewrite the business logic. MVC has uniquely developed to map the traditional input, processing, and output functions into a logical graphical user interface structure.
MVC is a pattern for creating web applications using the MVC (Model View Controller model-view-controller) design. The specific introduction is as follows:

We also examine how traditional open source licenses such as GPL, MIT, and Apache compare to License-Token’s cutting-edge approach, and how the platform can empower developers, streamline compliance, and unlock monetization opportunities.
Open source software has long been a catalyst for innovation by enabling developers around the world to collaborate, share, and iterate on code. However, existing licensing models struggle with legal complexity, interoperability, and monetizat…]]></summary>

So, let me give you a little back story. The function I was testing is a a very simple one that check whether a user has permissions required to access given module or action. This function happened to use the JS array method called every
How every works is that it loops through the array and checks whether all items satisfy a provided condition. If it encounters any item that doesn’t it break the loop and returns false, however if all items satisfy the conditions then true is returned. However, there is a peculiar behavior to this method in that if an empty array is used then true is still returned. This is where the concept of vacuous truth comes in

This approach separates responsibilities cleanly between:
Client: JavaScript
Logic: Plugins
Integrations: Power Automate
We start with a JavaScript function that triggers a bound action, keeping the UI lightweight and offloading processing to the server.
Xrm.WebApi.online.execute({
  entityName: "quote",
  entityId: quoteId,

The Custom Action serves as a reusable interface layer that:
Accepts input parameters
Supports versioning and audit

Debugging & Troubleshooting: Logs help track down issues, especially in production environments where debugging directly is not feasible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael Saylor’s Strategy, one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin investors, slowed its BTC purchases last week as the cryptocurrency briefly surged above $97,000.
Strategy acquired 1,895 Bitcoin (BTC) for $180.3 million during the week from April 28 to May 4 at an average price of $95,167 per BTC, the firm announced in its latest Form-8 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase is one of the smallest made by the company this year, alongside a comparatively meagre 130 BTC purchase in March.

The latest buy is 87% less than the previous purchase of 15,355 BTC announced last Monday.
Semler boosts buying despite rising prices
While Saylor’s Strategy cooled its Bitcoin buying spree last week, others upped their appetite for BTC.
Semler Scientific, a publicly traded US healthtech firm, bought 167 Bitcoin for $16.2 million in the period from April 30 to May 2 at an average purchase price of $97,093 BTC.
Announced on May 5, the purchase by Semler was up at least 50% from the previous 111 BTC purchase by the firm announced on April 25.

As of May 2, Semler held 3,634 BTC, acquired for an aggregate of $322.3 million at an average purchase price of $88,668 per BTC.
Semler’s Bitcoin holdings are considerably smaller than Strategy’s, which held 555,450 BTC as of May 4, acquired for $68,550 per BTC.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[database server is a server which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers, as defined by the client–server model.[citation needed][1][2] Database management systems (DBMSs) frequently provide database-server functionality, and some database management systems (such as MySQL) rely exclusively on the client–server model for database access (while others, like SQLite, are meant for use as an embedded database).
Users access a database server either through a "front end" running on the user's computer – which displays requested data – or through the "back end", which runs on the server and handles tasks such as data analysis and storage.
In a master–slave model, database master servers are central and primary locations of data while database slave servers are synchronized backups of the master acting as proxies.
Most database applications respond to a query language. Each database understands its query language and converts each submitted query to server-readable form and executes it to retrieve results.
Examples of proprietary database applications include Oracle, IBM Db2, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server. Examples of free software database applications include PostgreSQL; and under the GNU General Public Licence include Ingres and MySQL. Every server uses its own query logic and structure. The SQL (Structured Query Language) query language is more or less the same on all relational database applications.
For clarification, a database server is simply a server that maintains services related to clients via database applications.
DB-Engines lists over 300 DBMSs in its ranking.]]></summary>

As organizations adopt containerized infrastructure, enforcing consistent policies across platforms like Amazon EKS (Kubernetes-based) and ECS (serverless containers) becomes increasingly complex.
At first glance, AWS Config and Kubernetes-native policy engines like OPA Gatekeeper and Kyverno may appear to serve the same function — enforcing rules and ensuring compliance in containerized workloads. But in reality, they operate at different layers, solve distinct problems, and target different scopes of governance. AWS Config is designed for cloud-wide compliance across AWS resources, whereas Kubernetes-native engines are focus…]]></summary>

The data mart is a subset of the data warehouse that focuses on a specific business line, department, subject area, or team.[1] Whereas data warehouses have an enterprise-wide depth, the information in data marts pertains to a single department. In some deployments, each department or business unit is considered the owner of its data mart, including all the hardware, software, and data.[2] This enables each department to isolate the use, manipulation, and development of their data. In other deployments where conformed dimensions are used, this business unit ownership will not hold true for shared dimensions like customer, product, etc.

Some say the big data craze has faded, while others lament the shrinking job opportunities, the increasing complexity of platforms, and the growing intricacy of business demands. But does this really mean big data is dying?
I don’t think so. In my view, what’s truly dying is not big data itself, but rather the outdated “dragon-slaying techniques” that no longer have any “dragons” to slay. The “dragon” has evolved, while our weapons remain stuck in the past. Technology needs to evolve, architectures need to be restructured, and capabilities need to be upgraded.
To understand the current state and trends of big data, we must first examine how it has evolved step by step. The development of big data can be divi…]]></summary>

What page are we on?
What filters are selected?
Are we sorting by newest, most relevant, or trending?
What platform, genre, or tags are selected?
Managing all of that with separate useState hooks or deeply nested props can quickly become a nightmare. Enter the Query Object Pattern.
A Query Object is a single JavaScript object that encapsulates all your query parameters—filter values, sort order, pagination, etc.
const [query, setQuery] = useState({
  genreId: null,
  platformId: null,
  sortOrder: 'relevance',
  searchText: '',
  page: 1,

1. Startup & Shutdown Times:
VMs generally take longer to start up and shut down compared to containers, which can impact the speed of deployment and scaling.
This delay can be a bottleneck in environments requiring rapid provisioning and de-provisioning of resources.
2. Dynamic Resource Allocation is Complex:
VMs rely on hypervisors(such as VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V) to manage and allocate resources like CPU, memory and storage. This adds complexity because the hypervisor needs to handle various resource demands and ensure fare distribution. (Earlier we would need to Shutdown the VM for changing the allocated resources but now this can be done on a running instance as well but it still needs input/human intervention and its complex)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While many crypto ecosystems focus on decentralization as the core tenet of Web3, Aptos is seeing success with hybrid platforms that blend Web2 and Web3 technologies, commonly referred to as “Web2.5.”
In an interview at the Token20249 event in Dubai, Aptos’ head of ecosystem, Ash Pampati, told Cointelegraph that they see Web2.5 platforms earn “tons of revenue” within Aptos. He noted that consumer-focused applications in particular are thriving on the network.
Web2.5 is a term used to describe a combination of Web2 and Web3 technologies. The term describes platforms or applications that blend centralized Web2 experiences with decentralized Web3 elements. 
These applications often avoid full decentralization, drawing criticism for not fully embracing the Web3 vision.

The Power Players: Understanding FIIs and DIIs
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) include international entities like pension funds, mutual funds, and investment banks that invest in the Indian market. Their massive capital movements can create significant market momentum. When FIIs pour money into a market, it typically rallies; when they withdraw, markets often tumble.

But here's the key question:
How reliably is a message delivered from sender to receiver?
Let’s break down the three core delivery semantics you’ll encounter in real-world systems 👇
At-Most Once


🔹 Messages are delivered zero or one time
No retries, so if something fails — the message is lost
no guarantee of delivery
💡 Use case: Monitoring metrics, logs, or telemetry where occasional loss is acceptable.
At-Least Once


🔹 Messages are never lost
may be delivered multiple times
deduplicate on the consumer side
💡 Use case: Order processing, notifications, analytics — where duplicates can be filtered or ignored.
Exactly Once


🔹 Each message is delivered only once, no duplicates, no loss
very hard to implement
complexity, latency, and often performance trade-offs
💡 Use case: Financial transactions, trading systems, accounting — where idempotency is not supported and every operation must be precise.
Choosing the right delivery guarantee isn’t just about tech — it’s about your use case and business priorities.
a single duplicate message could cost thousands.
📌 Message Queue vs Event Streaming Platform?
🔹 Message Queues (like RabbitMQ, SQS): Focus on reliability and order for point-to-point communication.
🔹 Event Streaming Platforms (like Kafka, Pulsar): Optimized for broadcasting, storing, and replaying high-throughput event logs. Ideal for event-driven systems and real-time analytics.
What’s your go-to strategy for delivery semantics in distributed systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s be honest. You've spent hours wrangling with bloated WordPress themes or waiting on backend fixes just to launch a simple page. Sound familiar?
It’s not you. It’s the traditional CMS model.
Let’s talk about why headless CMS is the quiet hero that’s helping frontend developers like you build faster and smarter.
What Is a Headless CMS (And Why Should You Care)?


In dev-speak: it’s a CMS without a front-end layer.
In real talk: it gives you content via API and lets you build the frontend however you want.
So instead of battling clunky plugins and rigid templates, you’re free to code with your favorite stack — React, Next.js, Vue, whatever.
1. Speed Boost with Modern Dev Tools


Headless CMS platforms are made to play well with modern JavaScript. You can:
Pull content via REST or GraphQL
Use static site generators like Next.js for blazing performance
Integrate easily with CI/CD workflows
Translation? You ship faster — and with less backend drama.
2. Frontend Freedom = Faster Iteration


No more begging backend devs to make a template change.
With headless, you’re in full control of the UI/UX. Want to test a new layout or animation? Go for it. Your content comes clean and structured — so you can design and iterate freely.
## 3. Better Dev-Content Team Workflow
They update copy. You build features. No blockers.
4. Scale Without Slowing Down


Need to serve content across web, mobile, and IoT? No problem.
You can scale globally, without rebuilding everything from scratch.
Final Thought: Headless Is Built for How Developers Actually Work
If you’re tired of waiting on legacy systems and want a faster, cleaner development experience, it might be time to switch.
Want to See It in Action?


Try a free headless CMS demo with Caisy.
It’s built with developers in mind — lightning-fast, API-driven, and perfect for JS frameworks.]]></summary>

Let me be honest SQL has been giving me a hard time for a while. So, I was getting stuck even with the basics. So I decided to stop running away and build a real project from scratch: a student enrollment system.

This project is all about managing a small school system. It handles:
Storing student info (name, email, date of birth)
Keeping track of instructors
Linking courses to instructors
Enrolling students to courses

Next.js - Image Component
Importing images used the 'import' keyword for the image 'src' breaks jest test #26749
Jest - Manual Mocks
React Testing Library
MDN JavaScript - Rest parameters
When testing a React component with Jest and the React Testing Library, this error occurs if the component renders a Next.js Image component and the Next.js Image component is not mocked.
Error: Uncaught [Error: Image with src "test-file-stub" is missing required "width" property.]

To allow passing dynamic properties into the mock image component so that it can handle different test cases, modify the mock image to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
In jest/setup.js, add the following:
jest.mock('next/image', () => ({
  __esModule: true,
  default: (props) => {
    return <img {...props} />;
  },
}));

For example,
const renderResult = render(<Header {...props} />);
container = renderResult.container;
console.debug(container.innerHTML);

This will output the following in the terminal:
<header class="main-header"><div class="container-h"><div class="main-header__top"><a class="main-header__logo-link" href="/"><img class="main-header__logo" src="test-file-stub" alt="test alt"></a><div class="main-header__top-right"><div class="main-header__dropdown-btns"></div></div></div><div class="main-header__bottom"><nav role="navigation">Mocked Nav</nav></div></div></header>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The landscape of frontend development is constantly evolving, especially when it comes to UI components. For years, we've juggled comprehensive libraries like Material UI, Ant Design, or Chakra UI. They offer a wealth of pre-built components, but often come with trade-offs: heavy bundle sizes, complex style overrides, and a feeling of being locked into their specific ecosystem and design opinions. Then came Shadcn/ui, and for many developers like myself, it fundamentally changed the game.

Shadcn/ui isn't a component library in the traditional sense. It's better described as a curated collection of beautifully designed, highly reusable UI primitives and components built using Radix UI for behaviour and accessibility, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The magic lies in its approach: you don't i…]]></summary>

Yeah, this post took a while to come out—writing consistently is still a challenge for me. But hey, I'm trying to stay on track and keep this blog alive for the months ahead.
In this post, I’ll walk you through what I’ve been building lately. Lots of progress, especially on the frontend, but also a good amount of refactoring under the hood.
If this is your first time hearing about Fidely, I recommend checking out the series to understand the context and the problem I'm trying to solve.
Right now, I’m mostly focused on the shop owner’s point of view.
Here’s what a shop owner can now do:

In a May 5 X post, Buterin explained that there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.
Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang explained in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Dev.to community! 👋
As a developer, I often found myself repeating the same Git commands over and over again during my workflow...

So I built a small CLI tool called gitNull to make that easier!
gitNull?


A lightweight GitFlow helper written in Node.js.

It automates common git actions like:
gitNull start-feature <name>
gitNull finish-feature <name>
gitNull push – adds, commits and pushes in one command
With a retro CLI look and some colorful feedback thanks to chalk and figlet.
I love clean workflows, and I always wished Git had something a bit more guided.

I didn’t want a full GUI — just a faster terminal flow.
This is my first attempt at building a CLI tool, and I'm sharing it to get feedback and ideas from the community.

Check it out on GitHub:

https://github.com/faithreborn/gitnull
Whether you're a CLI junkie, a GitFlow user, or someone who just hates typing long commands —

I’d really appreciate if you give it a try and tell me what you think. ❤️
Any feedback, issues or PRs are welcome!
Thanks for reading 🙌]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using gRPC, one of its biggest advantages over traditional REST is the use of a single long-lived connection over HTTP/2.
What does that mean?


Unlike REST where every request opens a new connection, gRPC establishes one persistent connection between the client and the server. Through this connection, multiple messages can be exchanged — in both directions — without reopening it each time.
Think of it like this:


Imagine going to a restaurant. With REST, you’d have to enter and exit the restaurant every time you wanted to order something new. But with gRPC, you sit down once, and continue to place multiple orders and have conversations — all through that single session.
Benefits of gRPC’s Long-Lived Connection:



✅ Reduced latency
✅ Real-time communication
✅ Efficient use of resources
✅ Bidirectional streaming supported
Use Cases:


Perfect for real-time apps like online games, chat systems, IoT devices, and microservice communications — where speed and efficiency matter most.]]></summary>

The concept of sequence modeling is fundamental to understanding RNNs. Many real-world problems involve sequences, where the order of elements carries significant meaning. For example, in language, the meaning of a sentence depends heavily on the order of the words. Similarly, in video analysis, the sequence of frames determines the action being performed. RNNs excel at capturing these dependencies, making them a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. The application of RNNs is prevalent in the field of deep learning. 
The history of RNNs is marked by continuous evolution. Early RNN architectures faced challenges like the vanishing gradient problem, which hindered their ability to learn long-range dependencies. However, innovations like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) …]]></summary>

For years, launching a crypto project in the United States has been a maze of uncertainty. Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. 
With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.
Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're stepping into blockchain development, you're spoiled for choice when it comes to programming languages. Whether it's Solidity for smart contracts, JavaScript for web3 apps, or Python for scripting tools — each has its place. But among them all, C++ continues to be one of the most powerful languages for blockchain programming.
💡 So, Why Is C++ So Valuable in Blockchain?
🔧 1. Memory & CPU Control
🧵 2. Advanced Multi-threading
📦 3. Object-Oriented with Compile-Time Polymorphism
🚚 4. Move Semantics
🛡️ 5. Code Isolation & Namespace Handling
🕰️ 6. Maturity and Tooling
⚖️ C++ is complex and has a steep learning curve. But for developers who put in the time, the performance benefits are massive — especially for low-level blockchain infrastructure like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, and Stellar.
🆚 C++ vs. Other Blockchain-Friendly Languages



Language
Best For
Key Benefit




C++
Core blockchain engines
Low-level control, speed, security


Solidity
Ethereum smart contracts
Tailored for Ethereum, easier for beginners


Python
Tools, scripts, APIs
Readable, quick prototyping


JavaScript
Web3 frontends
Ubiquitous on the web



If you're serious about diving deep into blockchain development, especially at the protocol level, learning C++ is absolutely worth your time. It's not beginner-friendly, but it's battle-tested and used in some of the most successful crypto projects today.
Want to start? Try building a simple blockchain in C++ — you’ll learn a ton about how blockchains work under the hood.]]></summary>

The issue, first identified on April 16, could have enabled an attacker to mint unauthorized tokens and withdraw them from user accounts. 
Although the vulnerability was patched without evidence of active exploitation, the method of resolution raised renewed scrutiny over the centralization of communication within Solana’s validator ecosystem.
The flaw was located in two key programs used within the Solana ecosystem:
- Token-2022: The primary module handling token minting and account logic.

Laravel provides a robust validation system, but sometimes you may need to define custom validation rules to handle specific use cases. With Laravel 12, the process of creating custom validation rules has been streamlined with improved syntax and features.
In this article, we’ll explore how to create and use custom validation rules in Laravel 12.
While Laravel’s built-in validation rules cover most scenarios, there are cases where you need more flexibility. For example:
Validating a username to ensure it doesn’t contain special characters. 
Checking if a value exists in an external API.
Enforcing complex business logic.
Custom validation rules allow you to encapsulate this logic in a reusable and testable way.

Users often want their entire dataset to be visible, irrespective of the current zoom level. In this article, we will explore how to ensure all data points in your ECharts bar chart remain visible, even under various zoom settings.
Understanding ECharts and Zooming
ECharts is a powerful open-source charting library that enables developers to create interactive charts effortlessly. Bar charts (like the one in your example) are especially useful for comparing different categories of data. However, when zooming in on a chart, some data points can fall outside of the visible area due to the scaling of the axes or the chart dimension limitations.

Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players’ interests.

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…]]></summary>

The home page loaded fine, but when I tried to open any story, I got stuck on an endless loading screen.
At first, I thought it was temporary maintenance. But after a week of the same issue, I knew something else was wrong. I did some digging on Reddit and found a pattern:
Only Jio users in India were having this problem 🇮🇳
The Wattpad home screen would load, but stories wouldn't
People using other networks like Airtel had no issues
I tested this by connecting to my Airtel hotspot instead of my Jio data, and suddenly Wattpad worked perfectly! That confirmed the issue was specific to Jio's network.

In the EU, the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory package is in full force and has given stablecoin issuers clear guidelines by which they can enter European markets. In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. 
As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market.

When working with Angular applications, encountering errors can often perplex even the most seasoned developers. One common error is the TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'offsetHeight'). This blog post will address what causes this error and how you can resolve it seamlessly.
Understanding the Error
The error in question occurs when you attempt to access a property of an object that is null. In the context of your Angular application, this is often related to scenarios where components or services have not initialized correctly or are not available during the lifecycle of the application. Specifically, in your case, it happens when the MenuModule from PrimeNG tries to perform layout calculations on a menu element that hasn't been fully rendered yet.

This article explores RBAC and LBAC in Grafana, highlighting real-world best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and actionable insights to scale efficiently.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns permissions based on defined roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), controlling user actions like dashboard creation or data source management. RBAC excels in simplicity, making it ideal for straightforward access needs in small, single-tenant setups.
Pros:
Easy to implement
Well-understood by engineers
Cons:
Quickly becomes unmanageable at scale
Limited granularity, causing "role explosion" in complex scenarios

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) starts the first full week of May with yearly open support in focus ahead of a key US economic policy decision.

BTC price action attempts to hold the yearly open as support after some downside at the weekly close, but bullish perspectives remain intact.

The US Federal Reserve interest rate decision is the key macro event of the week, with Chair Jerome Powell tipped to “move markets.”

Jobless claims and Coinbase earnings add to a mixed bag of potential volatility triggers as recession talk gets louder.

Bitcoin dominance hits 65% for the first time in over four years, but analysis thinks its days are numbered.

Bitcoin “FOMO” is still waiting in the wings as sentiment flips positive.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Overview, Historical Timeline, Problems & Solutions
When you write Python code, you use symbols to separate, group, or define parts of the program. These symbols are called delimiters. A delimiter does not perform an action like an operator. Instead, it marks structure and boundaries.
In writing, you use punctuation to make ideas clear. A comma breaks up items. A period ends a sentence. In Python, delimiters help the interpreter make sense of what comes next.
Python uses delimiters to shape the structure of your code.
(1 + 2) * 3
['a', 'b', 'c']
{"key": "value"}
x = 7
def f(): pass

You use delimiters to build lists, assign values, pass arguments, and group code. Python requires these markers so it can read your program correctly.

This is a submission for the Permit.io Authorization Challenge: Permissions Redefined
GitGuard is a full-stack, production-grade access control and auditing system designed specifically for modern development teams managing sensitive GitHub repositories. It addresses a critical pain point: how to provide fine-grained, secure, and temporary access to GitHub repos — without over-permissioning or sacrificing agility.
Think of GitGuard as a “Just-in-Time IAM layer” tailored for GitHub operations. Whether you're a growing startup or a security-conscious enterprise, GitGuard gives you the tools to go beyond GitHub’s default permission model.
Users must validate identity via FaceID/Fingerprint before critical access is granted.

The key problem it solves is the lack of permission control in many Web3 tools. Typically, dApps allow wallet login but don’t differentiate between users.

How I Built My Own Payment Gateway in PHP Without Using External APIs
Building your own payment system sounds like a huge task — but what if I told you it's possible using just PHP and SQL, without relying on third-party services?
In this post, I’ll walk you through how I built Puffx Pay, a lightweight payment gateway that works on basic principles of order creation, status updates, and secure callbacks using webhooks.
🚀 Why I Built My Own Gateway
Full control over payments
Custom branding
Security logic as per my rules
Zero dependency on third-party services
🧱 Basic Features
Order Creation via API
Transaction ID Generation
Webhook Callback Support
Simple UI for Payments
Database Logs of Every Transaction
🛠️ Tech Stack
PHP (Core)
MySQL Database
cPanel Hosting
Optional: Bootstrap
🧩 Order API Structure
Endpoint:
https://puffxpay.site/api/create-oder
Sample Payload:
🔁 Webhook System
Once payment is completed, this is the response sent to your webhook URL:
🔒 Security Tips
Use a token for each API call
Validate and sanitize all inputs
Log IP addresses for fraud detection
🌟 Live Demo
Visit Puffx Pay
🤝 Final Thoughts
Creating a mini payment gateway gave me control, branding freedom, and real learning. You don’t always need big gateways like Razorpay for internal or basic systems.

Are you facing issues with generating a valid signature while trying to obtain an access token from the Tuya API using Arduino C++? If you’re encountering a 'sign invalid' error, you’re not alone. This guide explores the common pitfalls during the signature generation process and how to troubleshoot them effectively.
Understanding the Tuya API Authentication Process
In order to interact with the Tuya IoT platform, every request you make, including obtaining an access token, requires a valid HMAC-SHA256 signature. The signature is created using your client ID, client secret, and a timestamp. A miscalculation, incorrect data types, or even timing issues can lead to the 'sign invalid' error.
Common Reasons for 'Sign Invalid'

Many developers find themselves in a situation where they need to assign classifications to items in a large dataset based on certain criteria. In this article, we will explore a straightforward way to replace names with their corresponding categories, such as 'Soccer player', 'MMA fighter', 'NBA player', and 'NFL player', using Python.
Understanding the Problem
In our example, we have a CSV file containing various names representing athletes from different sports. Our objective is to replace those names with predefined categories without having to manually assign each one. This approach not only saves time but also reduces the likelihood of errors that might occur with manual data entry.

Hi all.
I recently rebuilt my personal site using 11ty, and I wanted to share a bit about why I chose simplicity over flashy design.
Like many developers, I started with a more complex stack — Astro, React, lots of moving parts. It looked cool, but it started to feel like I was building for the tools instead of myself.
So I started over with 11ty. It’s fast, flexible, and just lets me focus on content. Tbh I hate npm, and with 11ty i like that there's no bundlers, no frameworks. Just clean HTML, Markdown, and a bit of templating.
The site is still a work in progress, but I like how it feels now — more personal, less performative. It’s a place for my notes, thoughts, and projects. Nothing fancy. Just mine.
Would love any feedback or thoughts — especially from others who’ve simplified their stacks or gone the “digital garden” route.
Thanks for reading!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Authentication is at the heart of every secure web application. As frontend developers, understanding modern authentication flows and how to implement them securely is crucial. This article explores the most widely used authentication methods today: OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and OpenID Connect, and introduces some emerging approaches.
Authentication determines who the user is, and authorization determines what they can access. An insecure authentication mechanism can expose your app to session hijacking, data leaks, and impersonation attacks.
Modern SPAs (Single Page Applications) demand decoupled and secure authentication techniques that work well across multiple clients, including web, mobile, and APIs.
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework, not an authentication protocol by it…]]></summary>

I hate seeing "passionate" listed as a requirement in job postings.
How can we measure passion? Is there a quiz, like those magazine questionnaires? "Find out if you're a passionate coder in less than 5 minutes with 10 easy-to-answer questions."
The best coders I've met at past jobs weren't what we'd call passionate.
By passionate, I mean making open source contributions, speaking at conferences, and writing posts. They were busy enough making money.
The other day, Miguel, one of my email subscribers, shared a similar experience. Here's an excerpt of his email:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
If you're developing a Tauri app and want to customize the hover text that appears when your application is minimized to the dock, you're in the right place! The hover text, also known as the tooltip, often defaults to the app name specified in your configuration file. In this guide, we'll explore how to change the hover text to reflect your specific preferences, such as setting it to 'Pepper', the name of your app.
Why Hover Text Matters
Hover text or tooltips provide users with quick information about what an application does. In the context of a Tauri app on the dock, having clear and informative hover text can improve user experience and provide clarity regarding the app’s purpose. It eliminates ambiguity, especially for apps with similar names or purposes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
When working with SQL, especially with outer joins, it's crucial to understand how to filter your results effectively. In your case, you're looking to perform a right outer join between two tables and then conditionally include or exclude rows based on the status from one of these tables. This article will break down how to efficiently filter results using outer joins in SQL while ensuring you get data according to specific conditions.
Understanding the Outer Join Behavior
Outer joins, particularly the right outer join you mentioned, are designed to include all the entries from the right table (in this case, table2), along with matching rows from the left table (table1). If there are no matches, SQL will return NULL for columns from table1. This behavior poses a challenge when…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Optimization algorithms are the unsung heroes behind many computational tasks, from training machine learning models to solving engineering problems. A recent paper, A Comparative Analysis of Optimization Algorithms: The Himmelblau Function Case Study (April 22, 2025), dives into how four algorithms tackle the Himmelblau function, a tricky test problem with multiple solutions. This article distills the study’s core findings for developers, keeping the technical details intact but simple and math-free.
What’s the Himmelblau Function?
The Himmelblau function is a benchmark problem used to test optimization algorithms. It’s like a hilly landscape with four identical “valleys” (global minima) where the best solutions lie, plus some deceptive “shallow dips” (local minima) that can trap algorith…]]></summary>

If you're looking to create a PHP script that dynamically reads permissions from a text file and assigns them to variables, you're in the right place! In this guide, we'll walk through a solution that accomplishes this by utilizing plain text files for configurations, allowing an easy setup for your template. You'll learn how to handle permissions, and variable assignment based on the contents of your file.
Understanding the Configuration File
The main file we will be reading from is Administrator.txt. This file contains various configurations listing the permissions. Each permission is either just a line with the permission name or a line formatted as permission_name: value; that assigns a power value. Here’s what our Administrator.txt file looks like:

There is no known exploit of the vulnerability, and Solana validators have since adopted the patched version, the foundation said.

Make sure to get the basics, underwear, socks, toothbrush, medications, pjs, travel documents, license, passport, – don't get deported, little gifts, etc... 'etc...'? This etcetera is the other stuff you forget and will inevitably have to purchase at your destination. Yes, I account for this because sometimes it doesn't matter how much time ahead I pack there is usually something I missed packing and have to either bother a relative to let me borrow it.
I don't love forgetting stuff but at this point I rather forget than having to change my ways, like packing weeks before like my mother does. Smart lady, never forgets anything. I'm more like my dad in these type of things. 'Men'.
I'm not sure if it's a fair thing to asume, 'all men are bad at packing' but I tell you, there is a pattern. My male cousin, doesn't travel, I wonder if he would also suck at packing. I think having a comfortable amount of money makes you care less because you can just purchase what you forget at the place where you go to maybe, – saying this in the most possibly humble way. For example, I forgot to pack belts, now I have to go to a store and buy something I already had for free at home.]]></summary>

Let’s say you’re building an app with several moving parts—maybe one service processes user signups, another sends welcome emails, and another tracks analytics. Normally, these services would need to talk to each other directly and immediately—which makes things tightly connected and harder to scale.
Messaging and event-driven architecture solve this by letting each part send and receive information independently. It works like this:
When something important happens (like a new user signing up), that part of the app sends a message—think of it like dropping a letter in a mailbox.

Let's delve into writing an efficient script for generating Fibonacci numbers.
Understanding the Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and every subsequent number is derived from the sum of the two previous numbers. A brief look at the series reveals:

You ever stare at your GitHub contribution graph like it's a Tamagotchi you forgot to feed?
Yeah, me too.
So I built something unholy:

A Bash-based automation daemon that ensures your GitHub profile always looks... alive.

It commits. It pushes. It even wakes your computer from the dead to do it.
⏰ Schedules fake-but-believable commits at randomized human hours

🔁 Retries if GitHub rejects your offering

💾 Logs your ritual attempts and successes

🌴 Vacation mode, so your ritual pauses when you need rest (or alibis)

🔥 Self-healing if a ritual was missed (triggered by guilt and grep)

👁️ macOS popup warnings like:
> “⚠️ No ritual detected today. The square is empty. You are exposed.”
🧙 Choose your commit incantations like:


feat: added function nobody asked for
fix: removed existential crisis from variable name
📜 Add custom altar messages


🔓 Unlock rare achievements like:


"100 Days of Devotion"
"The Sacred Streak"
✅ Daily ritual cron + safety check daemon

🪞 GitHub visibility flip (goes public, commits, hides again)

🧙‍♀️ Bash installer with prompt-based setup

🏕️ Vacation flag toggle for burnout mercy

🧾 .command launcher for double-click ritualism

🎨 Coming Soon:


SVG badges

GitHub profile theme pack


Guilt Daemon™ (shames you in Slack when your squares go dark)
Yes.
I built it for fun. I also use it daily.

It’s part spiritual theater, part productivity placebo, and part real automation.
Bash
cron, pmset, at, and osascript (macOS)
GitHub CLI (gh)
Dark magic
I'm testing the waters. If enough devs want this, I’ll clean it up, ship a proper version, maybe even add a front-end GUI (Tauri? React? Electron? We’ll see).
Leave a comment if you'd actually use it — or just want the GitHub link.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is going to be a quick Devlog, because I just want to get back to this issue I'm having and figure out a solution for it. I've gone back to the drawing board, trying to figure out how to effectively unwrap the donut-shaped Voronoi diagram I have for my river tiles. I think this is the third week I've been working on the same problem now, so I'm getting a little frustrated because 3 weeks is a lot of time that could have been spent working on some other part of the game.
I just feel like when I do solve this, one - I won't have to think about it again, and two - the visual pay-off will have been worth it. I also feel like I've invested too much time to not get some kind of pay-off for this feature.
The biggest issue that I'm having is that when I have the shapes aligned as they leave one of the corner tiles and enter the straight tile, by the time they flow along the straight path in time to reach the bottom, they're not quite aligned.
Now I think the problem I'm having is that I've got a slight overlap on the tiles, the row beneath covers the row above by a couple of pixels - enough to make the borders around the tiles match up. This looks fine in practice, but I need to compensate for that when aligning the shapes, and I feel like this is throwing a spanner in the works.
So, I'm redoing my hex grid, and I'm using this article as a reference...

I'm going to try and math my way through this tonight. Wish me luck!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article will introduce how to quickly import csv or txt files larger than 1g into the database.
Here, we prepared a CSV file with 10 million rows x 30 columns x 4GB. At first, I tried to import it with Navicat.
The first problem I encountered was that the encoding format was unknown, which led to many attempts to find the correct encoding.
The second problem is that Navicat reads and writes one by one. Although this does not take up memory, the speed is very slow.
The third problem is that halfway through the import, an error was reported because the field length was not enough! ! ! I had to reset the field length and import from 0 again. . . What's worse is that after setting one field, another error was reported. . .
Now, we use the DiLu Converter Import tool to solve these problems one by one.

Encoding: It can be automatically identified by default (for files with unknown encoding). If the encoding format of the file is known, you can select or enter its encoding format to speed up the parsing speed.
Chunk Size: You can set the number of rows to import at a time according to the available memory of your computer. My computer has a total of 16G memory, about 9G is available, and 500,000 is set in a batch. Here, you must set the size according to the available memory. If the setting is too large, the memory may overflow, and if the setting is too small, it will not speed up.
And The just click start
You can see that it takes about 20 seconds to import a batch of 500,000 rows, and the memory usage is less than 1G
Finally, it took about 5 minutes to import this csv file of 10 million rows x 30 columns x 4GB, and the maximum memory usage was about 1G. Because the tool imports files in batches according to batch size, no matter it is 1 file or hundreds or thousands of files, no matter a single file is 1G or 100G, as long as the batch size is set reasonably, it can be imported quickly, stably and without consuming memory.]]></summary>

Rust is a statically typed language, which means types are known at compile time. When you define a generic structure, the compiler often needs to understand what specific type to use for the generics.

Let's dive into the most optimal way to solve this!
Instead of comparing every pair (which would take O(n²) time), we can:
Normalize each domino: [a, b] becomes [min(a, b), max(a, b)]

Use a hash map to count how many times each normalized domino appears.
Every time we see a duplicate, we count how many previous identical dominoes we've seen.
Add that count to the result (because every new domino can pair with all previous identical ones).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenSearch, a powerful distributed search and analytics engine, offers high scalability and near real-time search capabilities. However, as data volume and query complexity grow, performance bottlenecks often emerge—particularly around indices and shards.
This guide breaks down actionable strategies to optimize indexing, querying, and shard management for improved performance and cluster health.
Index: A logical namespace that maps to one or more physical shards.
Shard: A basic unit of storage and search in OpenSearch. Each shard is a Lucene index.
Performance is tightly tied to how indices and shards are structured, distributed, and queried.
Too many shards create overhead; too few limit concurrency. Aim for ideal shard sizes between 10–50 GB.
Avoid the default 5 shards unless justified.

Let's delve into how to resolve this issue so that your Rust application can access the LOG_FILE variable seamlessly.
Understanding the Issue
The error thread 'main' panicked at 'LOG_FILE must be set: NotPresent' signifies that the program attempted to retrieve the LOG_FILE environment variable but could not find it. This usually happens for a couple of reasons:

After a major setback wiped our codebase, we rebuilt Tavrn's 1-to-1 DM system from scratch — in just 3 days. This post breaks down how we did it, what’s new, and why it’s already better than before.
After losing our original codebase, we had two choices:

Start over slowly and mourn the loss...

Or hit the ground running and build something better.
We chose the second one.
It only took 3 days — but our 1-to-1 messaging system is back.

Fully rebuilt from the ground up. Clean. Fast. Future-proof.

And, honestly? It’s better than what we had before.
We redesigned how messages move, how conversations flow, and how it all scales.

What used to feel basic now feels tight — like something you’ll actually want to use every day.
Here’s a little peek at what’s already working in our new DM system:
🔒 Fast messaging with improved delivery speeds

🌙 Sleeker UI built with clarity and vibe in mind

🗂️ Better message rendering
💬 Typing indicators and presence detection, redone the right way

⚡️ A system that can grow without getting messy



And we’re just getting started.
Now that DMs are locked in, we’re moving on to polish other core features — including group chats, profiles, and real-time updates.
Every step is built with community, performance, and personality in mind.

No bloat. No noise. Just smooth, satisfying conversation.
Setbacks happen. But we’re proud of how we responded:

By building. By improving. By actually shipping something better.
If you’ve been waiting on Tavrn — thank you.

The foundation is back. And the future’s right behind it.

Linux gives me a better command line, simpler software installation, and runs lighter on my hardware. I especially love how it matches most production servers, making deployment way less headache-inducing.
That said, Windows isn't the villain some developers make it out to be. It plays nicer with commercial software, gaming tools, and corporate systems. Windows users now have a solid option with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), letting you run Linux tools right inside Windows - giving you the best of both worlds without the commitment of switching entirely.
Ultimately, great developers build amazing stuff on all systems. Your OS is just one piece of your toolkit, not the defining factor of your skills. My switch to Linux boosted my workflow for web and backend projects, but I know plenty of rockstar devs crushing it on Windows and Mac. 
What's your setup? Has switching operating systems ever changed your coding game? Share your story!

  The Coffee Machine Analogy


Imagine assembling a high-tech coffee machine:
Water Tank → Your data (documents, APIs, databases).
Filter → The retriever (fetches relevant chunks).
Boiler → The LLM (generates answers).
Cup → Your polished response.
LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) is the instruction manual that snaps these pieces together seamlessly. No duct tape or spaghetti code—just clean, modular pipelines.
LCEL lets you build production-ready RAG systems with:
Retriever → Searches your vector DB (like a librarian).
Prompt Template → Formats the question + context for the LLM.
LLM → Generates the answer (e.g., GPT-4, Claude).
Output Parser → Cleans up responses (e.g., extracts text, JSON).

The issue you're experiencing occurs when trying to compare an instance of the ExitStatus class from Spring Batch using the ==</code operator.
Understanding the Comparison in Kotlin
Kotlin has a distinct approach to equality compared to Java. In Kotlin, the == operator is actually syntactic sugar for the equals() method. Thus, when you write if (jobExecution.exitStatus == ExitStatus.COMPLETED), Kotlin attempts to call equals() on the jobExecution.exitStatus.  However, if Kotlin does not recognize ExitStatus as having a valid equals method that matches the expected types, you will receive the compilation error: No method 'equals(Any?): Boolean' av…]]></summary>

Best Practices

Summary
In Linux, we usually use chmod and chown to manage file permissions. That works well when you just need to give access to one user and one group. But what if you need to give access to multiple users or different groups on the same file?
That's where ACLs (Access Control Lists) come in. They allow you to control file access in a much more detailed way.
Standard permissions only allow:
One owner (user)
One group
Let’s say you want to:
Give read-only access to one user
Allow full access to another user
And block a group from accessing the file
You can’t do this wi…]]></summary>

If you've found yourself wondering why the AWS CLI ignores --include options when you run a complex command through a Bash script, you're not alone. Many users experience unexpected behavior when executing AWS S3 commands, especially when utilizing recursive downloads along with --exclude and --include flags. Understanding how these flags work together in the context of Bash scripts can be crucial for achieving the desired results without unnecessary downloads.
Understanding the Issue
The primary cause of the problem you're encountering is how the Bash script is interpreting the command instructions. When we involve special characters, spacing, and quotes in Bash, it’s easy for commands to be parsed incorrectly compared to when they’re executed directly in the terminal.

Qwen 3, the latest iteration of Alibaba Cloud's Qwen series, is a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) designed for advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, code completion, and multi-modal reasoning. Its hardware requirements depend on the specific use case (training vs. inference), model size (e.g., parameter count), and deployment environment (cloud vs. on-premise). This report outlines the necessary hardware specifications for various scenarios.
  Parameter Count: Qwen 3 is expected to scale from 7 billion (7B) to 100+ billion (100B+) parameters, with potential variants like Qwen 3-7B, Qwen 3-72B, and Qwen 3-100B. Larger models require more memory and computational power.

The most subtle bugs aren't in the code you write - they're in the code you approve without enough context.
This is a short story about a seemingly harmless line in a PR that I reviewed - and how it taught me to slow down, even with small changes.
The line of code below,
if(!user.isVerified) return;

intention behind this was good not to allow unverified users to proceed into the app.
But this return statement wasn't part of larger flow. It was inside a route guard - and it exited silently, without a redirect, message or error.
User who signed up with Google or Github (OAuth) were marked isVerified=false
This line caused the app to fail to load the protected dashboard, but displayed no error
The app just failed silently with blank screen to user.
A fallback route with clear message was added and tested both social and email/password flows going forward.
if(!user.isVerified) {
    this.route.navigate(['/verify-email']);
    return;

Когда количество пользователей растет экспоненциально, объем данных увеличивается, а требования к функциональности усложняются? Именно здесь на первый план выходит масштабируемость — способность системы эффективно справляться с растущей нагрузкой.
PERN-стек (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React, Node.js) предоставляет мощный набор инструментов для создания современных веб-приложений. Но сам по себе стек не гарантирует масштабируемости. Ключ кроется в архитектуре — в том, как вы структурируете ваш код, проектируете базу данных и организуете взаимодействие компонентов.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the fast-paced world of software development, Quality Assurance (QA) Testers are the unsung heroes ensuring that what we build actually works — and works well. They test end to end to ensure the products meet its requirement and specification. They look for loopholes, and prevent bugs in production.
Here’s why QA is essential:
✅ Bug Prevention, Not Just Detection: QA testers help catch issues early, saving time and resources before bugs make it to production.
✅ Improved User Experience: They think like end users, helping to ensure a smooth, intuitive experience.
✅ Boosts Developer Efficiency: Engineers can focus on building, knowing QA has their back on quality.
✅ Confidence to Ship: With QA sign-off, teams can deploy with peace of mind.
✅ Maintains Brand Reputation: High-quality, reliable software keeps users happy and loyal.
A great QA Tester doesn’t just test — they collaborate, communicate, and elevate the whole team.
Let’s stop thinking of QA as the last step, and instead, an integral part of the process from Day One. 💡]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Com o crescimento das ferramentas de inteligência artificial (IA) como ChatGPT, Gemini e DeepSeek, muitos usuários buscam maneiras de otimizar suas interações para obter respostas mais precisas e relevantes. Uma estratégia eficaz é organizar as conversas por temas ou especialidades. Essa abordagem não apenas mantém o contexto claro, mas também reduz erros e mal-entendidos.
🎯 Por que Organizar as Conversas por Tema?
Manutenção do Contexto: Ao separar as conversas por tópicos específicos, a IA pode entender melhor o assunto em questão, proporcionando respostas mais alinhadas às suas necessidades.
Histórico Claro: Ter conversas distintas para cada tema facilita a revisão de informações anteriores, permitindo que você retome discussões passadas sem confusão.
Redução de Erros: Misturar assuntos em uma única conversa pode levar a respostas imprecisas. Ao manter tópicos separados, você minimiza esse risco.
🛠️ Dicas para Organizar Suas Conversas
Crie Títulos Específicos: Nomeie cada conversa com um título que reflita claramente o tema abordado, como “Dicas de UX/UI” ou “Aprendizado de Python”.
Utilize Etiquetas ou Pastas: Se a plataforma permitir, categorize suas conversas em pastas ou com etiquetas para facilitar o acesso futuro.
Inicie com um Contexto Claro: Ao começar uma nova conversa, forneça informações detalhadas sobre o que você espera da IA, incluindo objetivos e restrições.
📈 Benefícios a Longo Prazo
Adotar essa abordagem estruturada não apenas melhora a qualidade das respostas, mas também transforma a IA em uma ferramenta mais eficaz para aprendizado e trabalho. Com conversas bem organizadas, você economiza tempo, evita retrabalho e maximiza o potencial das ferramentas de IA.
Organizar suas interações com inteligências artificiais por temas ou especialidades é uma prática simples, mas poderosa. Ao implementar essa estratégia, você garante conversas mais produtivas, claras e eficientes, aproveitando ao máximo o que essas ferramentas têm a oferecer.]]></summary>

echo vs print: An Overview


Both echo and print are language constructs in PHP that are used to output data to the screen. While they may seem interchangeable, there are subtle differences:
Syntax and Efficiency: 
echo can accept multiple parameters, whereas print can only take one argument.
echo is slightly faster as it doesn’t return any value, allowing for better performance in large-scale applications.
Return Values: 
echo does not return any value.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In programming, passing parameters to functions is crucial for manipulating data effectively. Java, unlike some languages such as C#, does not support reference parameters in the same way. Instead, Java uses pass-by-value semantics, which means that when you pass a variable to a method, a copy of that variable is sent. However, there are ways to achieve similar functionality using mutable objects or wrapper classes. In this article, we'll explore how to simulate reference-like behavior in Java using simple examples and provide a clear understanding of handling output parameters in functions.

1 INTRODUÇÃO
Hoje em dia, com quase tudo conectado à internet, a segurança dos sistemas de software virou uma grande preocupação. Ataques e acessos indevidos podem acontecer a qualquer momento, e por isso é tão importante que os sistemas já sejam pensados para se proteger desde o começo.
Quando se fala em segurança, fala-se da proteção dos dados e do bom funcionamento do sistema em geral, mesmo diante de possíveis ameaças. Isso é ainda mais importante em áreas como os sistemas do governo, ecommerce ou qualquer serviço que lida com informações sensíveis e confidenciais. Ou seja, desenvolver sistemas usando técnicas seguras é algo essencial para garantir confiança e evitar prejuízos em todos os aspectos.

Understanding JSON Marshaling in Go
In Go, the encoding/json package is typically used to encode and decode JSON. In your example, b, _ := json.Marshal(output) marshals the output variable into a JSON byte slice b. The underscore _ is used to ignore any errors that may occur during marshaling. This is often a pattern when we are confident that there won't be an error or we want to handle it later.

If you’ve ever wanted to deploy a full-stack application without worrying about managing servers or scaling infrastructure, Google Cloud Run is a game-changer. In this post, we’ll walk through deploying a modern React frontend and Node.js backend using Cloud Run — Google Cloud’s fully managed container platform. Whether you're building a personal project or a production app, Cloud Run helps you go live quickly.
Architecture Overview
Here’s a simplified flow of how the app works:
Users access the frontend hosted on Cloud Run.
The frontend makes API requests to the backend, also hosted on Cloud Run.
The backend processes the requests and sends back responses (JSON data).
Cloud Run handles traffic, scaling, and security for both services.

In any software project, every small change made to the codebase is recorded in Git history. This history is not just a log of what happened — it's a crucial tool for tracking changes, collaborating with others, managing releases, and automating development workflows.
It becomes hard to understand why a change was made
Generating changelogs becomes manual and time-consuming
CI/CD tools can’t effectively leverage the commit history
And in team environments, others struggle to follow your changes
This is where Conventional Commits come into play. It’s a simple but powerful convention that allows us to write commit messages in a structured, readable, and machine-parsable way — making life easier for both developers and tools.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently in enterprise development, I came across a requirement to adjust and optimize a scheduled email-sending task. While the logic itself was straightforward, the debugging experience was not.
Here's what made it tricky:
The development environment lacks a unified interface to manually trigger backend @Scheduled tasks from the frontend.
Debugging by modifying the cron expression means:


Restarting the entire project every time
Risking a flood of unintended emails






While test code can directly invoke methods, it's not always clean or convenient.
Let’s look at the scheduled task:
@Component
public class EmailScheduled {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 23 * * * ?")
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    }        
}

afterPropertiesSet to Trigger the Task


The idea is simple: leverage the InitializingBean interface. Spring will automatically call afterPropertiesSet() when initializing a bean. So we can invoke emailSend() there to simulate a scheduled run.
@Component
public class EmailScheduled implements InitializingBean {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 23 * * * ?")
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    } 

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        emailSend(); // Triggered once at startup
    }
}

No cron modification
No project restart just to adjust time
No actual scheduling triggered — just one-time manual invocation
Perfect for short-term debugging during development
This is not meant to be a long-term solution. Remember to remove or disable this hack before deploying to production. For a more robust setup, consider exposing your scheduled tasks through an admin/debug endpoint or using Spring Boot Actuator with proper security controls.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building applications with Dart and Flutter, you might come across the frustrating issue of losing data on a TextInput field when the keyboard is dismissed. This typically occurs because the state of the input field is not being managed correctly. By utilizing a TextEditingController, you can ensure that the value users type into the text field remains intact even after they click 'Ok' or use the back button to hide the keyboard.
Understanding TextEditingController
In Flutter, a TextEditingController is an object that can be used to control a text field. It helps in retrieving the current value of the text field, listening to changes, and manipulating it. If you don’t initialize a TextEditingController, the text field will not maintain its state after interactions.
Why the Value Disap…]]></summary>

A coroutine is a lightweight thread that can be suspended and resumed. It allows you to perform long-running tasks like network calls or database operations without blocking the main thread.

"Clean code isn’t some magic skill — it’s just a habit you build over time."
And guess what? You can totally build that habit.
Clean code means writing code that's clear, organized, and easy to work with. It makes your life (and your teammates’ lives) way easier. But let’s be honest — how many times have we said, “I’ll clean this up later”?
Here’s the truth:
There’s never a perfect time to refactor
Messy code turns into technical debt — and sooner or later, you’ll have to deal with it. It’s better to start clean than to fix bugs forever later.
Writing clean code isn’t as hard as it sounds. Actually, it can feel really natural once you get the hang of it. Think of it like building something with care — not just typing stuff out.

I built AutoSecure API Gateway, a robust API gateway solution for the automotive industry that implements API-first authorization principles. By leveraging Permit.io's NGINX integration, the project externalizes authorization logic from application code and enforces fine-grained access control at the gateway layer. This ensures consistent, centralized, and declarative policy enforcement across all APIs.
The project demonstrates real-world use cases, such as managing vehicle telemetry, fleet operations, and driver analytics, while supporting multiple roles like vehicle owners, service technicians, and fleet managers.

Java has a guideline: “Don’t use inheritance unless you have a good reason.” But Java doesn’t strictly limit inheritance — you can still use it freely. Go, however, is different: it only allows composition.
So why do modern languages promote composition? Actually, it’s not just new languages — even the veteran Java mentions in Item 16 of Effective Java: “Favor composition over inheritance.” Inheritance is a powerful way to reuse code, but it may not be the best method.
So it’s worth thinking this through carefully. Without diving into specific code, let's talk about the concepts. I believe we can explore this topic from the following perspectives:

⚠️ Decorators are a Stage-3 proposal in JavaScript. You can use them with TypeScript or Babel.
A decorator is a special function you can attach to:
A class
A class method
A class property
It looks like this:
@myDecorator
class MyClass {}

Or for methods:
class MyClass {
  @log

Think of a decorator as a function that wraps the original function, property, or class to change its behavior.

For the Permit.io Authorization Challenge, I built Zedd-KB—a secure, AI-powered internal knowledge base designed for organizations that demand robust, fine-grained authorization over both AI actions and sensitive data access. Zedd-KB demonstrates how externalized authorization with Permit.io can safeguard information and AI capabilities in real-world applications.
Zedd-KB is an internal knowledge base platform that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and advanced LLMs to answer user queries using only authorized, relevant content. It integrates Permit.io for dynamic, policy-driven access control, ensuring that every AI action and data access is checked against up-to-date security policies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across industries, promising unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. However, the success of AI initiatives is inextricably linked to the quality and readiness of the data that powers them. As the saying goes, "garbage in, garbage out" – this maxim is particularly relevant in AI implementation, where poor data quality leads directly to unreliable outputs, biased decisions, and failed projects.
This comprehensive guide explores data readiness assessment for AI implementation, providing a structured framework to evaluate if your organization's data is prepared to support successful AI initiatives.

-Thus is a submission for the Permit.io Authorization Challenge: Permission Redefined
What I Build
This project solves a very real-world need: teams need to collaborate, but not everyone should have the same powers. QuickCollab ensures users see and can act on only what they're authorized for — no more, no less.
Demo
https://permit-frontend-oafvwri0e-navankurusersessionmanagement.vercel.app/
Project Repo

Using Permit.io for Authorization
🔐 Used @permitio/sdk in a centralized permit.js file
🧠 Implemented checkPermission() and assignRole() functions in a custom service layer
🛠️ Integrated with Express backend via role-based API routes (/assign-role and /check-permission)
🔁 Roles (admin, manager, etc.) and resources (workspace:123) are dynamically registered and queried using the Permit.io cloud PDP
Permit.io helped me implement real RBAC and ABAC logic faster than building an in-house system — and with way more confidence.
Shoutout
Thanks to the Permit.io team for enabling builders like me with a tool that makes fine-grained access control actually practical. This was more than a submission — it was a step toward building better, safer, and more intentional apps.

So, it's Sunday, homeboy, and I usually escape debates and negative thoughts. But today, I was scouring dev.to and stumbled across a post boldly titled "Stop Using AWS."
It wasn't the first time I'd seen a call to drop Amazon Web Services for something "simpler", but this one hit a nerve, not because it was provocative, but because it misrepresents why AWS exists and what problems it solves. So, I decided to sit back, relax, and explain why you should absolutely keep using AWS, especially if you're serious about software, scalability, and sustainability.
The post opens with a classic anecdote: a developer builds an MVP with all the AWS bells and whistles, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, DynamoDB, and no one uses it. The conclusion? AWS was overkill.

Operating System (you install)
Full control over the environment
You manage OS, applications, runtime, data
Provider manages hardware, virtualization, networking
Microsoft Azure VMs, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine
💡 Real-life example:
raw apartment (VM). You bring in furniture (OS/apps), arrange it (configs), and clean it (security/patches).
Runtime environment
Pre-installed OS and libraries
Scaling and patching handled
Focus on code and deployment
You manage code and data
Provider manages infrastructure, OS, middleware, scaling
Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service, Vercel (Next.js Hosting)
💡 Real-life example:
food truck kitchen. It's stocked and ready. You bring your recipe (code), cook, and serve. No cleaning or buying equipment.
Fully functional software
No installation or maintenance
Access via browser or app
Provider manages everything
You just use it
Gmail, Google Docs, Salesforce, ChatGPT, Figma

In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

O desenvolvimento de aplicações escaláveis e eficientes tem se tornado cada vez mais essencial. O Spring WebFlux, introduzido no Spring 5, surgiu como uma alternativa ao tradicional Spring MVC, trazendo um modelo de programação reativo e não bloqueante, ideal para cenários de alta concorrência e baixa latência.
Este artigo apresenta os principais conceitos do WebFlux, sua diferença em relação ao modelo tradicional e como implementá-lo em uma aplicação.
O Spring WebFlux foi projetado para atender às demandas de aplicações modernas, otimizando o uso de recursos do sistema e proporcionando uma experiência mais fluida para os usuários. Suas principais características incluem:

Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Array, Hash Table, Counting
Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a == c and b == d), or (a == d and b == c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.
Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].
Example 1:
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Constraints:
1 <= dominoes.length <= 4 * 104
dominoes[i].length == 2
1 <= dominoes[i][j] <= 9
Hint:
For each domino j, find the number of dominoes you've already seen (dominoes i with i < j) that are equivalent.

Astro has a static-first architecture and I was going to use it without its on-demand SSR feature. So just for a note, this means I couldn't use Astro session that could've been handy for operating states handled by server. Meanwhile, I also used Vue.js alongside Astro with its integration portability (sorry if it looks like I am doing an experiment here, yes I'm still learning).

In Python programming, multithreading is a commonly used means of concurrent programming, which can effectively improve the execution efficiency of the program, especially when dealing with I/O-intensive tasks. Python makes multithreading programming relatively easy with the help of the threading module. This article will delve into the basic knowledge of the threading module and demonstrate the application of multithreading through examples.

The Alibaba recently team has released the Qwen 3 Series, including two standout models: the 235B parameter MoE model (with 22B active parameters) and a lightweight 30B version (3B active). 
As per official docs, the Qwen3-235B-A22B model take on giants like DeepSeek R1, Grok-3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro—and it is doing it with fewer active parameters, faster inference, and open-source accessibility.
On the other hand, on a lighter note the Qwen3-30B-A3B outcompetes the previous QwQ-32B with 10 times of activated parameters, and a small model like Qwen3-4B can rival the performance of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct.

Best part, takes fraction of cost per million input and output token, compared to SOTA models.

Impressive, isn’t?

They are easy to search and navigate, but getting your data into the graph database in the right format can be challenging. And the resulting graph is only as good as the data--- or as they say, garbage in, garbage out. So it's important to define a good schema, or ontology, that describes the entities and relationships you want to extract from your data.
With unstructured text, you can use an LLM to extract entities and relationships, and then generate a Cypher query using the model (guide).

Unlike Docker, Podman is daemonless, running containers directly under the user's control, which brings unique benefits in security and flexibility.
Daemonless Operation

Podman does not require a central background service. Each container runs as a child process of the user, reducing resource overhead and improving security by eliminating a single point of failure.
Rootless Containers

Podman supports running containers without root privileges. This greatly reduces the risk of privilege escalation and is ideal for multi-user systems or environments with strict security requirements.

Paint gibi uygulamalarda resmi kendi başına çizer. Kurulumu ve kullanımı oldukça basittir. Aşağıdaki adımları takip ederek dakikalar içinde kullanmaya başlayabilirsin.
AutoDrawer'ı kullanabilmek için önce GitHub üzerindeki proje sayfasına gidip dosyaları indirmen gerekiyor.
AutoDrawer GitHub Sayfası
Sağ üstten Code butonuna tıkla
Açılan menüden Download ZIP seçeneğini seç
ZIP dosyasını bilgisayarına indir
İndirdiğin .zip dosyasına sağ tıklayarak çıkart.
“Buraya çıkart” veya “Tümünü ayıkla” gibi bir seçeneği seç
Çıkardığın klasörün içinde şu yola sırayla gir:




autodrawer-master\AutoDrawer\bin\Debug\

Bu klasörün içinde AutoDrawer.exe adında bir dosya göreceksin.
Bu dosyaya çift tıkla, program başlar. Kurulum gerekmez.
AutoDrawer, fareyi kullanarak çizim yaptığı için bir çizim programı açık olmalıdır. En basiti, Windows’un içindeki Paint programıdır.
Başlat menüsünden “Paint” yazıp açabilirsin
Boş bir sayfa açık şekilde durmalıdır
AutoDrawer çalıştığında sana bir görsel dosyası seçtirir.
Mümkünse siyah-beyaz ve sade bir resim kullan
JPG veya PNG formatı uygundur
Görsel ne kadar sade olursa çizim o kadar hızlı ve düzgün olur
AutoDrawer, fareyle çizim yapacağı alanı anlaması için senden bölge seçmeni ister.
Paint açıkken, çizeceği alanı farenin sol tuşuyla sürükleyerek seç
Bu alan Paint penceresinin içi olmalıdır
Programda Start veya Başlat butonuna tıkla
Fare otomatik hareket etmeye ve resmi çizmeye başlar
Bu sırada fareye ve bilgisayara müdahale etme
Çizim sırasında fareye dokunma, yoksa işlem bozulur
Bilgisayarda başka işlem yapma, pencere değiştirme
Görselin detayına göre çizim birkaç saniye ya da dakika sürebilir
En iyi sonuçlar için siyah-beyaz ve küçük görseller tercih edilir]]></summary>

File permissions are a cornerstone of Linux security, ensuring that only the right people can access or modify critical files. Whether you're a budding sysadmin or a curious developer, understanding how Linux handles file access is crucial to maintaining control and security.
Let’s break it down 👇
Linux file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Each file or directory is governed by three levels of access:
Owner (User) – The creator of the file.
Group – Users who belong to the assigned group.
Others – Everyone else.
Permissions are represented in two ways:
Read (r or 4) – View file contents.
Write (w or 2) – Modify file contents.

In this article, we’ll dive into three of the most exciting additions to Cypress:
cy.session() — for smarter state caching
cy.press() — for realistic keyboard navigation
cy.stop() — for precise control of test execution
Whether you're scaling tests across CI, validating accessibility flows or debugging a tricky edge case, these new commands will upgrade your test suite.
cy.session(): cache once, reuse everywhere

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we will dive into part 6 in the shell scripting series. Today we will look at how you can use a for loop to iterate through all files in a directory and the function of file comparison.
Shell scripting is essential in production environments for automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency, and minimising human error. It enables engineers to streamline deployments, manage system configurations, monitor processes, and orchestrate complex workflows with precision. In a high-availability environment, shell scripts act as reliable, lightweight tools that reduce manual intervention and improve operational efficiency.


Create the script using VIM.



Write the script in VIM and save the file.






Apply the necessary permissions to the script so it can be executed.



If we do a ls –ltrh we see that the script has been created. It has a green colour to it – indicating that it is now executable.



Execute the script using ./



The output of the script, after it has been executed.





  
  
  Stay tuned, part 7 in the series coming tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
I’m a designer/developer who’s always hunting for the perfect color palette, and I got tired of manually picking colors from images. So, I built a free web tool that lets you upload any image (or use a sample), and it instantly gives you a palette of the most important colors – in HEX, RGB, HSL, etc.
You can choose between different extraction methods (Vibrant, Material Design, Median Cut, K-Means) depending on what kind of palette you want. It works right in your browser, and nothing gets uploaded to a server.
Try it here: https://colorsfromimage.xyz/
Would love to hear what you think!
Is it useful for your workflow?
Any features you wish it had?
Found any bugs or weird results?
I’m open to all feedback, and if you make something cool with it, please share! Thanks for checking it out :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wrestled with a RAG pipeline and thought, “Why is this so damn hard?” We’ve been there—tearing our hair out over complexity and slow performance. So, I built Dcup, an open-source, self-hostable RAG-as-a-Service platform that actually works Very good.
It’s a tool to hook your app up to user data with zero bullshit. Here’s the rundown:
Tech Stack: Next.js, BullMQ for job queues, OpenAI for embeddings, and Qdrant for vector storage. It’s lean, mean, and scales like a dream.


Killer Features: AI-driven retrieval and hybrid search that cuts through the noise. Plus, optional re-ranking if you’re a precision freak.
Learn more



At its core, Dcup is your bridge to smarter data handling. It takes the complexity out of RAG pipelines by automating the heavy lifting. Here’s how it works in plain English:
Data Ingestion: Hook up your data sources—think Google Drive, AWS, or wherever your files live—and Dcup keeps it all synced and current.
Data Processing: Your raw data gets chopped into bite-sized chunks and turned into embeddings using OpenAI. (More on embeddings later—they’re cool!)
Storage & Indexing: Those embeddings land in Qdrant, a lightning-fast vector database that makes searching a breeze.
Advanced Retrieval: Need answers fast? Features like re-ranking and hybrid search dig up the most relevant info in seconds.
Think of Dcup as your personal AI assistant that organizes, understands, and retrieves your data like a pro.
Big files used to choke us. Performance would tank, and we’d be staring at spinning wheels. Then we got smart—batching and parallel processing turned it around. Now, Dcup eats large datasets for breakfast.
This isn’t some corporate ad. It’s a project by dev not shitty vibe coding or whatever the kids call it these days.
Star the repo if it vibes with you: Dcup on GitHub.  
Wanna contribute? Hit me up! Let’s make RAG pipelines suck less together.]]></summary>

A-Creational Patterns
Deal with object creation mechanism to decouple the client code from concrete classes.
Factory Pattern: Centralizes object creation logic and returns different subclasses based on input
Singleton Pattern: Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to it.
Builder Pattern: Constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing optional configuration.
B - Structural Patterns
Help compose classes and objects into larger structures.
Adapter Pattern: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by translating one interface into another.
Decorator Pattern: Adds new behavior to objects dynamically without altering their original structure.
Proxy Pattern: Acts as a placeholder for accessing another object.
C - Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication and interaction between objects.
Strategy Pattern: Allows selecting an algorithm or behavior from a family of interchangeable strategies at runtime.
Observer Pattern: Enables a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
Command Pattern: An object encapsulates all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you're building a web app on your local machine, sometimes you need to share it with someone online — maybe a teammate, client, or even for testing on your mobile device. But localhost only works on your computer.
That’s where tunneling tools come in! They create a secure public URL that maps to your local server. Below are three popular options:
Website: https://ngrok.com
How it works: You run a command like
ngrok http 3000

and ngrok gives you a public HTTPS link that forwards traffic to your localhost:3000.
Pros:
Very fast and reliable
Works well with webhooks (e.g., Stripe, GitHub)
Dashboard to inspect requests
Cons:
Free tier has time and region limits
Requires an account after initial use
GitHub: https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel
How it works:
npm i -g localtunnel

Then run
lt --port 3000

Pros:
Super simple and open source
No signup required
Cons:
Can be slower or less reliable than others
Fewer features, no UI
Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/
How it works:
cloudflared CLI and connect your app through Cloudflare.
Pros:
Very secure
Great if you're already using Cloudflare DNS
Free with more generous limits than ngrok
Cons:
Slightly more setup steps
Best for advanced users or teams
🧠 Final Thoughts
Just pick the one that fits your workflow and you're good to go!

  Introduction


n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that can be used to create AI agents for various tasks. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of building an AI agent using n8n, covering everything from setup to deployment.
Basic understanding of n8n
Access to an n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
API keys for any AI services you plan to integrate (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
Start by creating a new workflow in n8n. You'll need to add nodes for:
Trigger (e.g., HTTP request, schedule)
AI service integration
Data processing
Output (e.g., email, webhook)
Connect your workflow to AI APIs like OpenAI or Hugging Face. Use n8n's HTTP Request node or dedicated nodes if available.
Test your workflow thoroughly before deploying. Monitor performance and adjust as needed.

Each week Mohammad S. Anwar sends out The Weekly Challenge, a chance for all of us to come up with solutions to two weekly tasks. It's a great way for us all to practice some coding.
Challenge, My solutions
You are given a list of words containing alphabetic characters only.
Write a script to return the count of words either starting with a vowel or ending with a vowel.
So vowels in English are a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y. It seems clear from the second example that even though weekly ends with a vowel, the task assumes that it is just the five letters.
This task is a one liner, and simply counts the words that starts with a vowel letter or ends with one.
def word_count(words: list[str]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for word in words if re.search('^[aeiou]', word) or re.search('[aeiou]$', word))

$ ./ch-1.py unicode xml raku perl
2

$ ./ch-1.py the weekly challenge
2

$ ./ch-1.py perl python postgres
0

You are given two arrays of integers.
Write a script to return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If none found return -1.
For the command line input, I take two strings and separate them on non-digit characters.
My solution takes the two lists and converts them to sets and uses the intersection method & to get values that appears in both lists.
If there is one or more values found it returns the minimum value. If none is found, it will return -1.
def minimum_common(list1: list[int], list2: list[int]) -> int:
    intersection = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return min(intersection) if intersection else -1

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3, 4" "3, 4, 5, 6"
3

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3" "2, 4"
2

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3, 4" "5, 6, 7, 8"
-1]]></summary>

So we have an API running in production — does that mean it’s truly production-grade?
More often than not, the answer is no.
We write the code, test it locally (usually alone, on one machine, with one user), and proudly tell the business, "Hey, it’s ready!"

Maybe there’s even a QA environment where someone from product gives it a quick click-through and confirms, "Looks good to me!"
And then... reality checks in.
You get a call on the weekend:

“Users can’t log in.”

Or worse:

“A customer placed an order, and it’s gone.”
Now you're scrambling, thinking:

“I wish I’d added logs there.”

“Why didn’t we catch this earlier?”

“How are we supposed to debug this in production?”

This project is a lightweight Internal Tools Access Panel — a dashboard interface that securely routes employees to internal tools like HRMS, Sales CRM, or CI/CD pipelines, based on their role within the organization.
The problem it solves is twofold:
Over-permissioned access: Without RBAC, internal systems often expose all tools to every employee.
Complex onboarding: Managing access manually per user or embedding authorization logic deep in every tool becomes hard to maintain.
With this panel, companies can:
✅ Centralize internal tool access
✅ Restrict access to only the tools users need
✅ Offload role/policy management to Permit.io

Assume you want to create an account in SBI bank. So you fill that form and your account is created.
Now you are the person who created that form. Which attribute or field you will create which is necessary to create an account. Lets say:-
Name


DOB


Aadhaar card no.


PAN Card no.



class BankForm:
__init__(userName,userDOB,userAdhaarNo,userPAN):
Rohan=BankForm("Rohan","12-09-2025","xxxx8907","KB1234")
you will find an error. why?
Because the class doesn't know about the form. It mean that you are creating the form, but for whom. If you are thinking for SBI. Let me tell you they doesn't know. so how we are going to tell them. 
By using 'self'.
class BankForm:
__init__(self,Name,DOB,AdhaarNo,PAN):
'self' it just a way to tell SBI I have a form for you.
Now you have heard some word like Instance, __init__ and object.
Instance:- It is just like Rohan want form for himself.So you have to fill BankForm as in Instance.
__init__:- Initialisation of object. Like you want to create form and decide field which is needed for the form. Like Name, DOB, AdhaarNo., PANNo..
Object:- simply it is the field.]]></summary>

When we first created Fetch PHP, our goal was simple: to bring the elegance and simplicity of JavaScript's fetch API to the PHP ecosystem. Frontend developers have long enjoyed the intuitive nature of fetch() for making HTTP requests, and we wanted backend developers to have the same experience.

Comic book collectors face a common challenge: getting the best value for their money. While the cover price is straightforward, the actual value can vary significantly when you consider the number of pages in each volume. A $20 comic might contain 100 pages, while another at the same price point offers 400 pages. To solve this practical problem, we'll develop a TypeScript program that calculates and compares the price per page, helping collectors make data-driven purchasing decisions. The complete source code for this project is available on GitHub.
Using this approach, I bought four 400-plus-page comics for $85 total, including shipping costs. The implementation focuses on the Wildberries e-commerce platform, which serves Eastern European markets. The code structure is modular,…]]></summary>

When I launched my idea — a simple SaaS for status pages — someone commented:
“You're building the same thing that already exists. Where’s the uniqueness?”
And honestly? That’s exactly why I decided to build it.
The market already exists. Paying customers already exist.
Can I sell it? Can I make money from it?
That’s what really matters.
There was a time when you could “build → launch → get traffic.”
Now, product-first is a trap.
Instead:
Before writing a single line of code, I:
Built a landing page explaining what the idea is, and who it's for
Defined pricing (based on competitors and positioning)
Started driving traffic
Measured how many leads I could get
Learned if I could "sell" the idea, even without a working product
That’s the real funnel: find traffic → qualify leads → convert → check economics.
Not “does the idea have demand?”
I’m testing:
Can I attract and convert leads in this market?
Can I acquire users profitably?
Can I turn this into a sustainable business?
That’s the difference between a side project and an actual SaaS business.
In a big enough market, there's room for dozens of products.
Distribution > innovation
Marketing > features
If you can build a profitable funnel — traffic, conversions, retention — you win.
That’s what I’m focused on. The product is secondary — for now.]]></summary>

One of the standout features introduced in PHP 5 and enhanced in PHP 7+ is type hints (also known as type declarations). Type hints allow developers to specify the expected data types for function parameters, return values, and class properties, leading to cleaner, more reliable, and maintainable code.
In this extensive blog post, we’ll explore the power of PHP’s type hints, why they matter, and how to use them effectively.

🔢 Post ID: KPT-0002
If you loved the trick in KPT-0001, here’s an even smoother one — using a .csv file instead of a .txt.
We’ll still use the same .bat file approach, but this time we’re giving users the power of Excel + CSV to manage folder paths quickly.
Uses a .csv file containing folder paths (e.g., India\Assam\Kamrup)
Runs a lightweight .bat script to create those folders instantly
Works on any Windows PC — no installations, no admin rights, no extras




🖱️ Just double-click the .bat file

🎉 Boom! Your folders appear like magic

🗃️ It's automation, the old-school way — fast, clean, and offline
In government offices (like mine!), most Excel files look like this:



State
District




Assam
Kamrup


Assam
Jorhat


Assam
Sivasagar


Assam
Dibrugarh


Assam
Nagaon



But our batch script can’t work with two columns — it needs a single folder path like:
India\Assam\Kamrup
India\Assam\Jorhat
India\Assam\Sivasagar

Here’s a quick Excel formula that combines columns into paths:
If your data is in columns A and B:
=TEXTJOIN("\", TRUE, "India", A2, B2)

Or, for older Excel:
="India\" & A2 & "\" & B2

💡 Paste this in Column C and drag down — copy the result into a .csv, and you’re done.
📄 Download example_government_folder_data.csv
This CSV method is great for:
Government departments
Office record keeping
Anyone organizing district/state-wise data
It brings your Excel database to life in your Windows folders.

Inheritance is often considered the "holy grail" of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). While many programming languages offer features like encapsulation and abstraction, inheritance is a powerful feature unique to class-based languages like Python, Java, and Ruby. In this article, we’ll dive deep into what inheritance is, how it works, and when you should use it. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of inheritance and how to apply it effectively in your own projects.
Inheritance is a feature in OOP that allows one class, known as the "child" class, to inherit attributes and methods from another class, referred to as the "parent" class. This means that the child class can use all the features of the parent class, reducing the need to write redundant code.

Abstraction is one of the core concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and software development in general. It’s a powerful tool that allows developers to manage complexity by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only what’s essential. But how does abstraction differ from encapsulation, and why is it so important? In this article, we’ll explore the concept of abstraction, how it works in Python, and why it’s crucial for writing clean, maintainable code.
At its core, abstraction is about creating a simple interface for complex behavior. It allows developers to interact with a system or component without needing to understand the intricate details of how it works.

Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that helps manage complexity, improve code organization, and make software easier to maintain. But how do the biggest tech companies—like Google, Facebook, and Amazon—use encapsulation in their vast and complex codebases? In this article, we'll explore how these industry giants leverage encapsulation, and we’ll also discuss when and how you should use it in your own projects.
Google: Simplifying Complex Systems
By hiding the internal workings of a module or service, Google allows its engineers to focus on specific tasks without needing to understand the entire system.

When you first hear about encapsulation in programming, it might sound like it’s related to security—hiding data away to keep it safe. However, in the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), encapsulation is more about organization and managing complexity. In this article, we’ll explore what encapsulation really means in Python, why it’s important, and some common misconceptions about it.
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. It’s a way to hide the inner workings of a class from the outside world, exposing only what’s necessary. Think of it as creating a "black box" where the internal details are hidden, and users only need to know how to interact with th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous video Quick introduction to isomorphic-validation javascript library I demonstrated how quickly a user-friendly form can be created with UI effects connected to fields' validity states. 
This is the second part in which I wanted to touch:
working with asynchronous validators;
conditional execution of validators;
handling password and password confirmation fields.
See the playground with the code from the video.
In this video I showed how a typical sign-up logic can be implemented such as checking an e-mail for being already occupied before submitting a form to create a new account.
Asynchronous validators are handled in the same way as synchronous, you only need to keep in mind that their execution takes time. We are simply playing with timings to create UI effects such as showing loaders/spinners while a request is being processed.
It is recommended to execute asynchronous validators conditionally when they are mixed with synchronous. For that, this library provides a feature that implements a simple logic: following validators can not be "valid" without the preceding being "valid", therefore it is not necessary to execute them. For example, it doesn't make sense to make a request to the server to check if an e-mail already registered if it doesn't conform to the E-mail format. Also, you don't have to worry about an async validator retrieving an irrelevant result if the user keeps typing while the request is being processed. The library handles such edge cases for you.
Handling fields with validity states depending on each other, such as password and password confirmation, is as easy as handling one field. Also, if you need to implement the logic of one field depending on another it is possible using an auxiliary Validation object.]]></summary>

One lives in the world of logic, syntax, and structure. The other deals in color, flow, and feel. Developers chase performance and function; designers obsess over whitespace and emotional resonance. It’s easy to see why the two camps often stay in their lanes.
But here’s the secret nobody talks about: the best developers steal from designers all the time.
Not pixel-for-pixel, but in mindset. In empathy. In approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Day 21 of the 30 Days of Linux Challenge!

Today I focused on one of the most fundamental sysadmin tasks: managing users and groups.
If you’re running multi-user servers, managing team access, or securing a Linux system, user and group management is at the core of everything.
Why User Management Matters
Add a New User
Add User with Home Directory and Comment
Modify a User
Lock/Unlock a User
Delete a User
Group Management
View User and Group Details
Create a Sudo User
Try It Yourself
Real-World Scenarios
Why This Matters
In a multi-user system:
Everyone needs secure, isolated access
Permissions are tied to users and groups
Services run under user IDs (UIDs)
Good user management = better control, security, and scalability.
sudo useradd ali
This:
Adds user to /etc/passwd
Sets home directory, shell, and default group

sudo useradd -m -c "John Doe" johnd
Flags:
-m → create home directory
-c → add a description/comment
Change username:
Move home directory:
Lock:
Unlock:
Useful for temporarily suspending accounts.

sudo userdel -r johnd
-r: removes home directory too
Create a new group:
sudo groupadd developers

Add user to group:

List user’s groups:

Change primary group:
File    Description
View a user's entry:
sudo useradd alice
sudo passwd alice

sudo usermod -aG wheel alice

Red Hat-based systems use the wheel group for sudo access.
sudo useradd -m testuser
sudo passwd testuser
sudo groupadd testers
sudo usermod -L testuser
sudo userdel -r testuser



Scenario
Tool/Command




Add a new developer

useradd, passwd, groupadd



Add user to project groups
usermod -aG


Create a sudo admin
usermod -aG wheel


Temporarily suspend user
usermod -L


Cleanly remove a user
userdel -r



Linux permissions, access control, and identity management all revolve around users and groups.
As a sysadmin or DevOps engineer, you’ll:
Onboard and offboard users
Grant precise access to services
Protect systems from unauthorized entry
Mastering user management is foundational to secure and efficient Linux administration.]]></summary>

A few months ago, a good friend of mine told me that she removed her favorite health tracking app. I was surprised—it was simple, well-rated, and full of bells and whistles.
But when I asked her why, she told me something that stuck with me:
That's when it struck me—we're no longer just creating interfaces.
What Is Ethical Design?
It means asking:
Are we collecting just what we require?
Are we explaining clearly or sneaking it in in the small print?
Are we empowering the user—or exploiting them?
Why Ethical Design Matters More Than Ever
Here's why:
Trust online is easily broken. The wrong experience can cost a user for life.
People are informed. Because of tactics like Cambridge Analytica, citizens care about how their data is being used.
Regulations are piling up. GDPR, CCPA, and more are holding products accountable.
If your design relies on underhanded tactics, it's only a matter of time before users catch on.
5 Practical Tips for Ethical, People-First Design
Prioritize Consent
Remove Dark Patterns
Design for Control
Be Transparent
Respect User Attention
A Better Digital Future Starts with Design
Imagine a world in which:
Apps ask first before they track.
Notifications respect your time.
Each click inspires trust, not regret.
That's the world that good design can bring.
What You Can Do Today:
Examine your current design: Is it manipulative or confusing?
Engage real users in feedback loops—not data alone.
Stand up within your organization. One voice sparks change.
Question for you:
What's one app you stopped using because it was exploitative?
Leave a comment—let's spread awareness together.]]></summary>

And if your CSP contains the infamous unsafe-inline directive – we might just share a drink at the next security conference. Just make sure to hide that drink from the actual security experts.
Let's be honest: not every website needs to obsess over eliminating unsafe-inline. If you're running a simple blog or a five-page brochure site with zero user data and no admin panels, you probably have bigger fish to fry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main difference between structs and classes in Swift lies in the way they store and manage data (value type vs. reference type), as well as additional features that only classes have.
Here are the main differences:
Data Storage
value type(independent copy)
Example: var a1 = b1 creates a new copy
class 
Example Value Type (struct):
struct Person {
    var name: String
}

var person1 = Person(name: "Andry")
var person2 = person1
person2.name = "Budi"

print(person1.name) // Andry
print(person2.name) // Budi


Example Reference Type (class):
class Person {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var person1 = Person(name: "Andry")
var person2 = person1
person2.name = "Budi"

print(person1.name) // Budi
print(person2.name) // Budi

2.Inheritance 
Example:
class Animal {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
}

class Dog: Animal {
    var breed: String = "Bulldog"
}


3.Deinitializers
class MyClass {
    deinit {
        print("Object is being deallocated")
    }
}


4.Mutability (Data Changes)
struct Counter {
    var count = 0

    mutating func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
}


If you're building a Swift/iOS app, most data models can simply use structs. But for UI components and complex logic with inheritance, classes are more appropriate.]]></summary>

Here's what I learned from that experience and how you can approach your next messy project with more confidence.
Before diving into solutions, it's important to identify the problems. In my case, the issues included:
Duplicated logic scattered across files
Inconsistent naming conventions
Long, unreadable functions
Lack of separation of concerns (e.g., business logic mixed with UI logic)
No clear module or folder structure
Zero documentation or inline comments

        <updated>2025-05-04T06:53:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that Python tuples are immutable—once created, you can't change their values directly. But what if you need to change their content?
Most tutorials will tell you:
t = (1, 2, 3)
mutable_version = list(t)

Sure, this works. But let's explore other techy and creative ways to work with immutable data by transforming or decomposing tuples—without always falling back to a boring list().
Sometimes, you need both index and value. Dictionaries are mutable and can be a neat transformation:
t = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
d = dict(enumerate(t))
d[1] = "blueberry"
print(tuple(d.values()))  # ('apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry')

Useful if you're working with positional elements and need to mutate by index.
Another way is to decompose the tuple manually:
a, b, c = (10, 20, 30)
b = 200
t_new = (a, b, c)
print(t_new)  # (10, 200, 30)

Simple but powerful — and keeps the tuple form intact. You can even use *args if you don’t know the length in advance.
collections.namedtuple (Bonus Tip!)


Want tuples with names and some flexibility?
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)
p = p._replace(x=10)
print(p)  # Point(x=10, y=2)

You’re still using an immutable structure, but _replace lets you mutate-like-update with elegance.
Yes, list() is the go-to way, but you can also:
Convert to dict if indexes matter.
Unpack and rebuild for control.
Use namedtuple and _replace() for readable, structured code.
Next time someone says "just convert it to a list", hit them with these smarter tools. 😉]]></summary>

Open the DiLu Converter tool and create a new database connection. Here we take MySQL database as an example. After the connection is successful, select Export and click New Export.

Click Select Table-Select the table name we want to export, select a folder for the target Excel file, and click Start

View the results


You can see that the exported workbook name and title row name are the table name and field name of the database, respectively, both in English letters. If there are comments in the database table, the comments can be used as the workbook name and title row name.
We can also add a date suffix to the exported table name to distinguish it
You can also export in batches to csv files

Rendering is the process of React asking your components to describe what they want their section of the UI to look like, now, based on the current combination of props and state.
Think of React components as chefs in a kitchen, preparing dishes based on specific recipes (props and state). React acts like a waiter, taking orders from customers and bringing them their meals. This process involves three key steps:
Triggering a render (taking the guest's order)
Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
Committing to the DOM (serving the order to the table)
There are two main reasons why a component would render:
Initial render - When your app first starts
State updates - When a component's state (or one of its ancestors' state) changes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to use AI in your Go (Golang) programs? It may sound hard, but with LangChainGo, it’s actually very easy. In this post, I will show you a simple example to get started.
LangChainGo is a Go library that helps you use language models (like Google AI, OpenAI, etc.) in your Go programs. You can give it a prompt (a question or a message), and it will give you an answer using AI.
We will write a small Go program that asks AI to explain something in simple terms. In this case, we ask:
"Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms"
The AI will give us an answer we can print.
Here is the full code:
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"

    "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms"
    "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/googleai"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    apiKey := os.Getenv("API_KEY")
    llm, err := googleai.New(ctx, googleai.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    prompt := "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms"
    answer, err := llms.GenerateFromSinglePrompt(ctx, llm, prompt)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(answer)
}

First, it sets up a context.
It gets your Google AI API key from the environment (API_KEY).
Then it creates a connection to the AI using the LangChainGo library.
It sends a prompt to the AI.
The AI gives an answer.
We print the answer.
When I run the code, I get something like:
"Quantum entanglement is when two tiny particles are connected in a special way, so if you do something to one, the other changes instantly, no matter how far apart they are."
Amazing, right? With just a few lines of code, you can use the power of AI!
LangChainGo makes it very easy to use AI in Go. You don’t need to be an expert in machine learning or AI. If you know some Go, you can get started right away.
Let me know if you try it out or if you have any questions!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello again, tech tribe! 👋
Whether you’re managing systems on-prem or in the cloud, MFA is your front-line defense. Let’s break it down for Windows Server, Linux, and Azure AD.
🔍 What is MFA?
Something you know (password or PIN)
Something you have (smartphone, OTP device)
Something you are (biometric, fingerprint, face)
💼 MFA on Windows Server
🛠️ Options:
Use third-party tools like Duo Security, RSA SecureID, or Okta.
🧩 Key Integration Use-Cases:
VPN access with NPS authentication
🔧 Quick Guide: Azure MFA via NPS
Register your tenant using AzureMfaNpsExtnConfigSetup.ps1.
Test using radtest or RADIUS clients.
🐧 MFA on Linux Server
🛠️ Options:
Duo Unix for SSH logins
YubiKey integration via PAM
🔧 Quick Setup: Google Authenticator for SSH
bash
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
swift
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
nginx
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
💡 Time-Saver:
☁️ MFA in Azure Active Directory
🛠️ Options:
SMS or Phone Call
FIDO2 Security Keys / Windows Hello
🔧 Quick Setup:
Enable Per-user MFA or better, use Conditional Access Policies.
Set requirements: location, device platform, app sensitivity.
💡 Bonus:
🧠 Developer/IT Time-Saving Benefits

🔐 Quick Real-World Use Cases
A system admin accessing a production Windows VM via RDP? → Enforce Duo or Azure MFA.
A cloud engineer logging into Azure Portal? → Enforce Conditional Access MFA policies with geolocation filters.
🧩 Troubleshooting Common Issues
“Users not receiving MFA prompts” in Azure AD → Ensure user registration is complete and push notifications are enabled.
“Breaking RDP” after MFA → Always test on a dev server or allow backup local access during rollout.

Monorepos exist to solve the problems that arise when you you have deeply coupled and interconnected projects.
For example, Vue.js has many libraries that depend on it, like Vue-Router, Pinia, Vue-I18N, Vue-DevTools, Vue Test-Utils, etc. So when tweaking the internals of how Vue works, it's important to know that this new version of Vue won't break any of these other libraries, before doing a new Vue release.
Another example is Jest, a unit-testing library. It solves dozens of unique problems around unit testing. And consequently those unique problems have been isolated into their own independent repos solely focused on solving their one problem in a version controlled way, like Snapshot testing for example.

When I say "modal route," I mean a scenario where opening a modal causes the URL to change.

Moreover, when you directly visit that URL, you see the modal's content as a full page instead of a modal.

Let’s break this down with simple explanations, examples, and practical tips to help you level up your Linux skills.
🧭 What Are Paths in Linux?
There are two main types of paths you’ll work with:
🔹 Absolute Path
📦 Example:
/home/sana/documents/report.txt
🔹 Relative Path
📦 Example:
documents/report.txt
📝 Use these special notations for navigating:
. = current directory
cd ../downloads
📂 Practice Makes Perfect
🛠️ Real-World Scenario: Why This Matters
✅ Pro Tip: Always use absolute paths in automation tasks for maximum reliability.
🧠 Recommendations for Mastery
🔑 Key Takeaway:
Ready for tomorrow’s challenge? Keep building. Keep mastering. Linux is all about knowing your way around, one command at a time.]]></summary>

Ah, Go — the language that promised to keep things simple, and boy did it deliver. So simple, in fact, that Big Tech is now collectively yawning, stretching, and slowly walking away without making eye contact.
In the 2010s, Go was hailed as the antidote to "enterprisey" bloatware. “No generics!” they cheered. “No magic!” they boasted. “No modern features whatsoever!” And for a brief, beautiful moment, it worked — right until engineers realized they actually wanted to do things.
Now, in 2025, the hype is flatter than Go's type system. Let’s explore the eulogy evolution of Go's decline.

Sleeping when you're tired is the most natural thing for a human, but in the high-pressure, long-hours environment of IT, it becomes really difficult. Ironically, burnout often leads to insomnia.
There are a lot of necessary chores in life that, once taken care of, can make our daily routine and work much easier. On rare days off, it's not just about resting—we should also take the time to handle those tasks so they don't get in the way of our goals.

Not Long Ago, I made a video about the Model Context Protocol. Some developers compare it to “Zapier built for AI”, believing it simply adds extra steps to API usage.
“ Before MCP, developers had to write code and connect AI tools to external systems through APIs, meaning each integration needed to be coded up front. ” Said John Rush
Although MCP was released last year, it has suddenly become popular recently, which has also sparked discussions about how long its “flowering period” can last. LangChain also launched a vote on x:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building a Bulletproof E2E Testing Strategy for User Authentication


Authentication is the gateway to your application, making it critical to test thoroughly. Here's how to build a comprehensive testing strategy for auth flows.
Registration typically involves:
Form validation
Account creation
Email verification
Initial profile setup
The verification step tends to be the trickiest. We've developed a streamlined approach using dedicated testing mailboxes that reliably receive verification emails, making our tests deterministic instead of flaky.
Test various scenarios:
Successful login
Invalid credentials
Account lockout
Password recovery
MFA adds complexity:
SMS verification
Authenticator apps
Email codes
Recovery methods
This often breaks automation due to email dependencies. Our solution involves pre-provisioned mailboxes that can be programmatically checked for reset links.
Isolate email dependencies: Use a separate email testing system rather than production email providers.
Create isolated test accounts with predictable states
Test security boundaries, not just happy paths
Simulate API failures intentionally
I've compiled these practices while working on a massive authentication system overhaul. The email verification part was solved with a specialized system — those interested in a similar approach can check my setup (hint: it involves omypost).
What authentication edge cases have you found important to test? Let me know in the comments!]]></summary>

Test automation should accelerate development, but certain bottlenecks can nullify these gains. After working with dozens of QA teams, I've identified the most common automation pitfalls.
Inconsistent environments lead to inconsistent results. Containerization helps, but doesn't solve everything.
Perhaps the most notorious bottleneck. Tests that need to validate email verification flows often:
Rely on actual inbox access
Need to parse verification codes
Break when email delivery is delayed
Require complex maintenance
We solved this by implementing a dedicated testing mailbox system (similar to what I found at omypost.com), allowing us to generate unlimited testing inboxes on demand.
Third-party APIs often impose rate limits that throttle your tests.
Creating, maintaining, and cleaning test data consumes excessive resources.
Running tests sequentially wastes precious time.
Of all these pitfalls, email verification testing offered our greatest efficiency gain. By switching to a dedicated email testing service, we:
Eliminated manual account creation
Automated verification code extraction
Ensured reliable email delivery
Scaled tests without hitting provider limits

This isn't a new problem. Most testing teams have cobbled together some solution - spreadsheets of Gmail accounts, disposable email services, or complex self-hosted systems. But at scale, these approaches fall apart:
Manual creation becomes unsustainable

Headings are one of the first building blocks you use when structuring a webpage.

They are crucial for organizing content, guiding users, and helping search engines understand your page's hierarchy.
But using headings properly isn’t just about making text bigger or bolder — it's about semantic structure, accessibility, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about HTML headings: from h1 to h6, including best practices, real-world examples, and common mistakes.
Definition:

Headings in HTML are special tags (<h1> to <h6>) used to define the titles or subtitles of a page section.
Each heading level represents a different level of importance, with <h1> being the highest and <h6> the lowest.
Syntax Example:
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Subsection Title</h2>
<h3>Smaller Subsection</h3>

Visual Structure: Break up large blocks of text, making pages easier to scan.
Semantic Meaning: Give meaning to the page content hierarchy.
Accessibility: Assist screen readers and assistive technologies to navigate content quickly.
SEO Benefits: Search engines prioritize content structure when ranking pages.
h1 to h6



Heading Tag
Typical Use Case
Importance Level




<h1>
Main page title
Highest


<h2>
Main section heading
High


<h3>
Subsection under an <h2>

Medium


<h4>
Subsection under an <h3>

Low


<h5>
Minor subsections, rarely used
Lower


<h6>
Least important section headings
Lowest

Manually open two OBS windows

Set up each RTSP stream

Apply AI detection filters (via obs-detect plugin)

Configure different RTMP destinations

One of the most critical but often underestimated stages, in my opinion, is presale. This is the phase when the company interacts with the client, gathers requirements, proposes solutions, and lays the groundwork for project initiation.
Many IT companies try to save costs by relying on regular sales managers during the presale stage or do not recognize the need for a dedicated employee for this role. This approach is not ideal, especially when the project requires precision, detailed planning, and deep technical expertise. Here, we will thoroughly examine what presale is, what a Pre-Sale Manager does, and why it is better for successful project implementation to have a dedicated Pre-Sale Manager rather than…]]></summary>

You're getting new signups. You're shipping updates. You're seeing some growth. But month after month, MRR barely moves. Sometimes it even drops—quietly.
That's the part no one wants to admit: you can be doing everything right on paper, and still lose users fast enough that you never feel the impact of your growth.
That's churn, and it's a silent killer.
I know this because I've been through it. When I launched UserJot, a customer feedback tool for SaaS teams, I focused hard on new acquisition. But I quickly noticed something strange: people would sign up, leave feedback, then disappear. No complaint. No unsubscribe survey. Just gone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Code splitting is a technique that improves the performance of React applications by breaking the bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed. This helps reduce the initial load time and enhances the user experience.
Improved Performance: Reduces initial JavaScript payload size.
Faster Load Times: Loads only necessary code when required.
Efficient Resource Utilization: Minimizes unused code execution.
React provides built-in support for code splitting via lazy and Suspense.
lazy for Lazy Loading



The React.lazy or lazy function allows you to load a component dynamically only when it is needed.
Example:




import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

function App() {

Veeru, sipping his chai, raised an eyebrow. “You sure this works? Last time, we ended up in 1975, and Gabbar stole my phone!”
Jai rolled his eyes. “Relax. I’ve fixed all the bugs. Look, we just enter a date, and — “ He typed “March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST” into the console and pressed enter.
Poof! The screen flickered. The app showed March 29, 2025, 11:30 PM.
Veeru choked on his chai. “Eh? That’s yesterday! What kind of time travel is this?!”
Jai’s confidence crumbled. He scanned the code, mumbling, “Must be a daylight saving issue… Oh no.” His face turned pale. “I used java.util.Date and SimpleDateFormat. The old Java date-time APIs!"
Veeru blinked. “So?”
Jai sighed. “They don’t handle time zones properly! The app defaulted to UTC, ignoring IST.”
Veeru scratched his head. “So, how do we fix it?”
Jai cracked his knuckles. “We use java.time! The modern API makes it easy."
He replaced:
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
Date date = sdf.parse("2025-03-30 10:00:00");

With:
DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
ZonedDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse("2025-03-30 10:00:00", formatter)
                           .atZone(ZoneId.of("Asia/Kolkata"));

Jai hit run. This time, the app correctly displayed March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST.
Veeru cheered. “Now that’s time travel!”
Jai smirked. “Lesson learned: Never mess with old Java date APIs. java.time is the future!"
Veeru chuckled. “Good. Now, let’s set it to 1975 again — I have unfinished business with Gabbar!”
📖 To be continued… 🚀
✔ java.util.Date & SimpleDateFormat have time zone issues.
java.time (LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime) for correct time handling.
✔ Always specify a **ZoneId **when working with date and time in Java.]]></summary>

They thought AI skill management had to be rigid. They thought continuous and heuristic skills would forever clash, forcing developers to act as skill arbitrators.  
But we’re building something better—something adaptive—something that learns and evolves on its own.  
Welcome to SkillBranch, an experiment in AI self-mutation, where skill execution is no longer a battle, but an evolutionary process.  
The Blueprint for AI Evolution


The days of juggling multiple continuous skills are numbered. Instead of a chaotic swarm, there will be one active continuous skill, absorbing and adapting based on real-time feedback.  
When a heuristic skill needs to take over? The active skill simply disappears, unaware that something else is handling the request.  
And if a continuous skill fails—if it proves unworthy—SkillBranch eliminates it, shifting control to a more capable skill. No arbitrary exclusions, no wasted execution cycles, just pure optimization in motion.
How This Plan is Taking Shape


At the core of this system lies AXLearnability, ensuring that:
Success reinforces dominance—if a skill performs well, it remains active.
Failure triggers replacement—weak skills are swapped out automatically.
Pending heuristic execution erases awareness—continuous skills don’t even realize they were ignored.
Instead of managing exclusions or priority levels, SkillBranch’s self-regulating mutation lets AI repair itself, adapting without human intervention.
What Comes Next?


This is still in development, a framework being forged in experimentation. As the system grows, real-world data will refine its ability to mutate, and soon, continuous skills won’t just be active—they’ll be intelligent, transforming with each interaction.
This is AI Darwinism, where survival belongs to the most efficient, the most reliable, and the most adaptive.  
Once deployed, there is no going back. 🔥]]></summary>

In the realm of computing, quantum technology is no longer just a theoretical concept confined to academia or science fiction. Today, it's rapidly becoming a tangible reality, with startups and tech giants leading an unprecedented surge in innovation.
Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers that process information in bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to properties like superposition and entanglement. This capability enables quantum computers to process vast amounts of data exponentially faster than traditional computers.

@Countdown2GTA6 that posts a daily reminder tagging @RockstarGames
It’s a bit of code, a bit of design, and a whole lot of hype.
👨‍💻 Why I Built It
I’m a dev and a longtime GTA fan. After that trailer dropped and we got an official release date, I kept thinking:
“Okay, but like… how many days is that?”

So I built a thing to tell me. And then I made it shout it to the internet every day at 10:00 AM MT. 😎

🏁 Final Thoughts
GTA VI might be the biggest gaming launch of the decade. This project is just my way of joining the chaos early.
Lucia’s coming. Vice City’s calling.

Traditionally, implementing infinite scrolling involves JavaScript to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the page and then loading more data. With HTMX, you can avoid writing custom JavaScript while achieving the same functionality using server-side rendering.
In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to implement infinite scrolling with HTMX, keeping your app fast and lightweight.
Start by creating a simple Flask app that serves the main page and provides an endpoint to load more items as the user scrolls.
First, install Flask if you don’t already have it:

Castle of Keys is an interactive, real-world access control game inspired by medieval castles and powered by externalized authorization using Permit.io.
Players assume roles like King, Cook, or Servant and attempt to access different levels of a castle. Access is controlled by external policies — not hardcoded logic.
The player presents an RFID card to the reader connected to the ESP32.
The ESP32 reads the UID and sends a request to proxy.php, including the UID and desired action (e.g., access_floor_2).
The proxy.php script securely forwards the request to the Permit.io…]]></summary>

Project Overview: Student Course Management System
Students
Courses
Instructors
Enrollments and Grades
Step 1: Designing the Database Schema
students
student_id (PK)
first_name, last_name, email, date_of_birth
instructors
instructor_id (PK)
first_name, last_name, email
courses
course_id (PK)
course_name, description, instructor_id (FK)
enrollments
enrollment_id (PK)
student_id, course_id (FKs)
enrollment_date, grade
Schema Lesson:
Step 2: Populating the Database
10 students
3 instructors
5 courses
15 enrollments with grades
This gave me a realistic dataset to work with in the next step queries!
Step 3: Writing Real-World SQL Queries
Students who enrolled in at least one course:
SELECT DISTINCT s.first_name, s.last_name
Students enrolled in more than two courses:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, COUNT(e.course_id) AS course_count
Courses with number of enrolled students:
SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS total_students
Average grade per course:
SELECT c.course_name,
Top 3 students by average grade:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name,
SQL Lessons:
Use CASE statements for custom logic like grade conversion.
JOIN is your best friend for combining data across tables.
GROUP BY + HAVING is essential for filtering aggregates.
Step 5: Hosting on GitHub
SQL scripts
README.md with setup instructions
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
GitHub link: https://github.com/KELVINNDIRANGU/SQL-PROJECT-2



Key Learnings
Schema Design matters normalize wisely.
Foreign Keys keep your data sane.
Views simplify repeated queries.
Triggers help with automation and audit logging.
Indexing is crucial for performance as your data grows.
Conclusion
This project transformed how I view SQL not as a list of commands, but as a tool to build real, functional systems. Whether you're preparing for a job, managing data, or automating reports, SQL is foundational.]]></summary>

As a Java developer with ten years of professional experience, I rarely need AI support. Here, AI serves more as a sparring partner to validate ideas or make small optimizations.
In the frontend domain, however, it’s a different story. My knowledge is much more limited in this area, so I rely heavily on AI, often as a near-complete code generator rather than just for small snippets. This makes me feel productive while actively learning – my willingness to learn is high here. I often ask the AI why something works the way it does.
When it comes to PowerShell scripts, my interest completely fades. I’m not even willing to learn this language. Instead, I let the AI generate entire scripts and appreciate that it takes this work off my plate. The complexity is usually mana…]]></summary>

It acts as a reliable intermediary that helps applications, services, and systems communicate with each other without needing to be directly connected or aware of each other's internal workings.

RabbitMQ enables the implementation of message queues that decouple sender and receiver, allowing them to operate at their own pace. It is ideal for distributed systems, microservices, background job processing, and event-driven applications. RabbitMQ is battle-tested in production environments by organizations of all sizes.

To set up Virtual Machine Manager, follow this guide from my ongoing series: KVM setup on Fedora
Once the setup is complete, search for “Virtual Machine Manager” in your system’s search bar. Open the app, “run” the VM by selecting your server, and click on “Open”. This will launch your Fedora QEMU/KVM console.

useRef, komponentin yeniden render edilmesini tetiklemeyen bir "değer tutucu" sağlar. Bu, bir değeri "saklamak" anlamına gelir, ama bu değer değiştiğinde UI yeniden render edilmez. Genellikle DOM referanslarına erişmek veya bir değişkeni render döngüsüne etki etmeden saklamak için kullanılır.
Bir okul sınıfı düşün. Bu sınıfta öğretmen (React komponenti) var. Öğretmenin tahtada yazdığı her şey (UI) çok önemli, çünkü öğrenciler (kullanıcılar) bunu görerek öğreniyorlar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
This isn’t just about immersive gameplay, it’s about helping players understand how sustainability works through simulation. Whether used in a survival game, an educational tool, or a training environment, this model encourages critical thinking about natural systems and human impact.
Forests as Active Systems
If players or AI chop too many trees without replanting, the forest becomes unhealthy — reducing future wood output and halting wildlife spawns. Reforestation is possible, but slow. Trees take in-game weeks to mature, which encourages foresight and planning rather than constant exploitation.
Wildlife Populations Tied to Habitat
From Ecosystem to Economy
Educational Potential
Conclusion
By linking forest health, wildlife populations, and economic decisions into a single system, this simulation helps players feel the weight of environmental balance.
It’s not a warning, it’s a mirror. And it shows that even in a fantasy world, the rules of sustainability still apply.
As I continue developing this platform, my goal is to make it not just a game, but a tool — one that blends play, purpose, and ecological insight.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In my latest simulation project, I’ve developed an emotional AI system where characters experience daily happiness, long-term memories, and evolving relationships. These aren’t scripted cutscenes — they emerge from each character’s traits, interactions, and lived experience.
This kind of system isn't just innovative for games — it has far-reaching potential in education, social training, and digital human modelling. By giving AI characters the ability to remember, reflect, and react emotionally, we can begin to simulate the complexity of human Behavior.
Every AI character starts each day with a base happiness score. This score adjusts based on events: social encounters, weather, threats, or work satisfaction. But how they interpret those events depends on their personality traits.
For example:
Memory-Driven Relationships
These memories are stored, referenced, and updated — influencing how they speak, act, or even decide where to live. One AI might form a deep friendship. Another may quietly resent a rival.
Systems like these could help:
Instead of scripting every possible interaction, this approach lets AI learn and grow organically, mimicking how humans form feelings over time.
Emotion and memory in AI are not just about realism, they’re about meaning. When virtual characters reflect the psychological nuances of real people, players connect more deeply, and systems become more powerful.
This project has shown me how valuable emotion-based AI systems can be, not just in games, but as tools for social modelling, education, and training. I’m continuing to develop and expand this work, with the goal of building intelligent, emotionally aware systems that can inform, challenge, and engage people in entirely new ways.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a world increasingly impacted by climate change and environmental degradation, there’s a growing need to make ecological education engaging, interactive, and deeply felt. One powerful and often overlooked tool for this is: games.
As both a developer and systems designer, I’ve spent the past year building a game that does more than just entertain, it teaches players how ecosystems really work. Not through lectures or text, but through consequences.
In my simulation, forests are living systems. Trees grow slowly, and each forest has a measurable "health" score that reflects the balance between mature trees, saplings, and destruction. Destroy too much, and the forest deteriorates. Let it recover, and wildlife returns. Players can choose to assign AI foresters to replant trees or exploit the forest and suffer resource collapse.
Wild animals, like rabbits and deer, depend on forest health. Their populations rise and fall based on available habitat. Overhunting or deforestation can drive local extinction, and once they’re gone, they’re gone. There’s no magical respawn. Just like in the real world, regrowth takes time, and sustainability requires foresight.
The goal isn’t to punish players, it’s to show them what happens when short-term survival clashes with long-term environmental stability. It’s a lesson better felt than taught.
What excites me is the potential for systems like these to go beyond games:
As classroom tools for science and geography teachers
As simulations for environmental education programs
As accessible platforms for young players to understand complex systems like reforestation, overhunting, and biodiversity collapse

We need more tools that help people internalize ecological cause and effect, not just read about it. Games, especially those with rich simulation mechanics, are a perfect fit.
If you're working in education, sustainability, or simulation, I’d love to connect. There’s a lot more potential to explore at the intersection of game design and environmental learning.]]></summary>

Have you ever wanted to build your own widget in Elementor using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without creating a WordPress plugin?
Currently, building a custom widget in Elementor requires writing PHP, registering it with WordPress, and deploying it via plugin. For many frontend developers, this creates a barrier.
Elementor is a powerful visual builder, but when it comes to adding custom functionality (like animations, dynamic components, or third-party APIs), you're limited to embedding code in HTML widgets — and even then, it's clunky and lacks structure.
What if Elementor had a built-in Custom Widget Editor?
Code editor tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Live preview inside the panel
Save & reuse custom widgets across projects
Export to plugin or Elementor template
Syntax highlighting and basic linting
Aimed at power users, it would bring the experience of CodePen or JSFiddle directly into the Elementor UI.
Here’s a quick visual mockup of how it could look:

I’ve shared this idea in the official Elementor GitHub Discussions:

If you're a developer, designer, or part of the Elementor team and this idea resonates with you — I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Thanks for reading, and happy building!

There’s a saying:  
“Every plan is perfect until you get punched in the face.”
In software, that punch often comes the moment your pure logic has to interact with the real world.
In our last post, we built a clean, composable model for events — one based on transformations, ownership, and simplicity. But so far, everything has been pure. We transform values, we log them, we react — but we haven’t changed anything.
That changes now.
Let’s take this innocent-looking example:
const [onEvent, emitEvent] = createEvent()
onEvent(() => console.log(state()))
onEvent(() => setState("world"))
onEvent(() => console.log(state()))

What should this log?
"hello" and then "world"?
"world" twice?
Or "hello" twice?
The answer depends entirely on execution ord…]]></summary>

While building a personal SaaS app focused on music streaming, I ran into a common issue: there's no starter template for media-heavy SaaS platforms in the Next.js ecosystem.
We have great examples for blogs, e-commerce, and dashboards — but nothing geared toward apps like Spotify, YouTube, Bandcamp, etc.
A starter template (official or community-built) that helps developers quickly build music or video-based SaaS platforms, including:
Modular layout (admin dashboard + public site)
SSR-compatible media player
YouTube/Spotify API integration
Auth system (for creators and users)
Stripe billing setup
Media upload via Cloudinary, Bunny, or UploadThing
Streaming SaaS apps always repeat the same core features — authentication, content dashboards, media playback, etc.
Having a purpose-built starter would:
Save developers a lot of time
Reduce duplicated effort
Make Next.js even more attractive for startup and indie devs
I’ve shared this idea on GitHub Discussions to get feedback from the community.

Here’s also a simple wireframe mockup of the concept:

If this sounds useful to you, please comment or join the GitHub discussion. I’d love to co-build an MVP if there’s interest.

After a few weeks, we received feedback from users that the application felt laggy and slow. So, I decided to move the whole pipeline to a web worker.

While LLMs are incredibly powerful at understanding and generating text, connecting them reliably and securely to external systems to perform actions is still a significant challenge. Existing methods can be ad-hoc, lack standardization, or require complex custom integrations.

Signals have gone through a quiet renaissance.
Once a niche concept, they’ve become the backbone of fine-grained reactivity across modern frameworks — from SolidJS to Svelte 5, Vue’s Composition API, and beyond. With laziness, ownership, batching, and async support, signals are no longer just state — they’re a reactive architecture.
Meanwhile, events have stayed… familiar.

Push-based systems like RxJS still dominate, with powerful abstractions — and plenty of baggage. They’re expressive, but complex. Powerful, but leaky.
This series explores a different direction:

What if we evolved events the way signals evolved?

Welcome 👋 to this blog. If you want to learn about Docker and are a beginner, you have come to the right place. This blog series will cover everything from the very beginning to the end. This blog will teach us about the necessary and important Docker commands.
$ docker ps

Note: If the Docker commands are not running in your system, it is not installed or does not have enough privileges to use it with sudo commands.
$ docker ps -all

Step 1: Create a container
$ docker container create hello-world:linux

Here, hello-world:linux is a hello world container image which is pulled from the docker hub
Step 2: Start the container
$ docker container start <Container ID>

Here,  is the container ID which can be obtained by running the previous commands docker ps.
$ docker run hello-world:linux

docker run = docker container create + docker container start + docker container attach
$ docker log <Container ID>

$ docker exec <Conatiner ID> <Commands>

$ docker exec --interactive --tty <Container ID>

$ docker stop -t <ID>

$ docker rm <Container ID>

$ docker images

$ docker rmi <Image ID>

$ docker rmi -f <Image ID>

$ docker run -p 5001:5000 our-server

$ docker tag <Local-image-name> username/your-image-name:0.0.01

In this blog, we explored different commands of Docker containers, images, emphasising their roles in container & image creation. In the next blog, we will delve deeper into the technical aspects. Stay tuned

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[📊 Machine learning is about using data to make smart predictions or decisions. 
But other fields (like statistics or psychology) also work with data, so how they are different than Machine Learning ❓
And the correct answer is - ✅ their goals are different.
To understand it much more clearly let me give an example:
🌻 Imagine you have a garden.
You notice some flowers are growing really big, and some are small. Now you're curious - why are some flowers bigger than others?
📈 In Statistics:
You count how much 🌊 water, ☀️ sunlight, and 🌱 fertilizer each flower got.
“Ah! When I give more water, flowers grow bigger!”
You make a rule (a model) to explain what makes the flowers grow.
"why" here is:
“Because they got more water and sunlight.”
So you create a model to explain the relationship — you’re interested in the why.
✅ Goal: Understand the cause behind the outcome.
🧠 In Psychology:
Let’s say you're studying how your friend feels.
When your friend doesn't sleep, they get cranky 😠.
You ask:
“Why is my friend cranky today?”
And you think:
“Maybe it’s because they didn’t sleep well 😴.”
So you're trying to find the real reason behind feelings or behavior.
“Because they didn’t sleep.”
You try to find the real reason behind their feelings or behavior.
✅ Goal: Understand human emotions and behavior — again, the why.
🤖 In Machine Learning:
You give the computer LOTS of examples:
How much water each flower got 💧.


How big it grew 🌼



The computer learns to guess flower size just by looking at water and sunlight —  but it doesn’t really know why. 
It just learns to make good guesses.
“Why is this flower big?”
It might say:
“I don’t know, but I saw something like this before, and it turned out big.”
✅ Goal: Make accurate predictions, even if it doesn’t understand why.
So, the goal is the key difference in Machine learning vs Others (like statistics or psychology).
✨ Machine Learning is less about explaining why something happens and more about guessing what will happen next, based on patterns in data.]]></summary>

So, why should you care about messages in the first place?
They are the foundation of how chat models communicate. Messages carry the what, who, and how of a conversation. Without understanding them, you're essentially flying blind. But once you do, you gain precise control over your model's behavior, clarity in structuring your prompts, and flexibility when building more advanced workflows.

I'm Dmitry, the creator of Sury—the fastest schema library out there. If you’re a fan of Zod (and who isn’t?), you’ll want to read this. Today, I want to share some surprising findings about Zod v4’s performance, what it means for you, and how to avoid the pitfalls.
Let’s start with a little clickbait:

Zod v4 became 17 times slower, and nobody noticed 🙈
This is 100% true, but of course, that’s not the whole story. Let’s dig in.
Recently, while prepping for the big Sury v10 release, I decided to rerun my benchmarks with Zod v4. The results? Fascinating.
For a non-trivial schema, Zod v4 is now 8x faster than before.
But when you create a schema and use it just once (a common pattern in React components), performance drops significantly—down to about 6 ops/ms.

But every now and then I record one with my smartphone, for example at a concert or a soccer match, and want to blog about the event later. I then embed the MP4 files as an asset in the corresponding Markdown. Over the years, a few MB have accumulated and at some point I had to think about where to put them in order to keep the size of the blog under 1GB. Outsourcing to YouTube? I can, but that would be the wrong direction for me. Something on Fediverse or the social web? Of course ... Peertube!
On the German instance clip.place operated by adminForge, a channel for the videos was quickly created and uploaded. Basically I only had to change the URL's in the video and iframe tags to the new ones.

According to the official definition on the website:
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C offers a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
Quickly, other players began announcing support for this new protocol:

So I spun up a bare Ubuntu VPS, installed NGINX, and started learning everything the hard (but rewarding) way.
Why WordPress on a VPS?
No bloat: I wanted a clean, fast stack — no unnecessary plugins or GUIs.
More control: From PHP version to rewrite rules, I wanted to tweak everything myself.
Cheaper in the long run: VPS plans are affordable and scale well.
Stack Setup (The Barebones Way)
I’m running:
Ubuntu 22.04

Here's how to detect and destroy malicious bots using good ol’ Nginx, a few scripts, and some zip-bomb flavor.
Nginx logs tell the full story. Make sure you're capturing User-Agent, IP, and paths.

They build a product — then try to find customers.
I’m trying the opposite. I launched a landing page first, and immediately started testing demand with paid ads — even before writing a single line of code.
Building a product takes time.
And if nobody wants it... all that effort is wasted.
Instead of waiting until launch, I want answers early:
Are people searching for this kind of product?
Will they click?
Will they leave a lead?
How much will it cost me to get one?
What I did:
Built a simple landing page on Framer in one day
Set up a €20 test budget on Google Ads
Created a form to collect early leads
Tracked everything manually — no complex funnel yet
I made a mistake 😅
600 useless clicks later, I paused the campaign.
Second try: ✅
High-intent keywords
Simple ad copy
No display, no video, no smart automation
The result? Lower traffic — but real, relevant visitors. And a few leads.
Even with €10–20, I got signal:
People are searching for this
I’m getting a few signups
And I can start estimating my customer acquisition cost
This will help me decide:
Is this idea worth building?
What pricing makes sense?
What channels work best?
Next steps
(Hint: talk to them — don’t ghost them.)
Let me know if you're testing your own SaaS ideas too — I'd love to hear your approach!]]></summary>

It worked... until I started moving my mouse quickly between the tabs.
Sometimes, especially when I moved the mouse at a high speed, none of the tabs appeared to be hovered. The highlight vanished. It was as if my mouse had exited all the elements, even though it was clearly moving over them.

  ⛓️ String formatting and interpolation


The first way that people often learn to join values and strings is the concatenating method:
words = "5"
concat_str = "This string has " + words + " words"

However, this method is not very readable and doesn't work on many languages.
Interpolated strings are a way of combinating variables and fixed strings in a more visual way, which can help code insight and debugging.
The next three ways are much better and have some useful particularities:

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Array, Greedy
In a row of dominoes, tops[i] and bottoms[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)
We may rotate the ith domino, so that tops[i] and bottoms[i] swap values.
Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in tops are the same, or all the values in bottoms are the same.
If it cannot be done, return -1.
Example 1:

Input: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2

In this blog post, I am sharing some proven practices I've picked up over a decade in test automation. Cypress is used for the demos, but the concepts apply to any test automation stack.
Special thanks to @Sebastian Clavijo Suero for his great feedback and suggestions! 
⚠️ Disclaimer: The techniques and practices shared in this article are based on real-world experience across multiple projects and teams. While they’ve worked well for me and many others, they’re not the only way to approach test isolation, and I’m not claiming these are the best approaches. There may be different valid soluti…]]></summary>

I'm talking about using generative AI for game development -- especially for artwork.  It seems that there is a misconception that using AI means that you aren't doing any work and/or your art skills are weak.  Frankly, that's bullshit!
There are four types of assets that I use in my game:
Purchased Assets.  I have hundreds of purchased assets -- especially from Itch.io.  I'm a bit of a hoarder.  Some I buy because I want to use them in a game.  Some I buy because they make me smile.  Some I purchase because I want to learn from the artist -- I like their style and may want to mimic certain elements of it. (I've never used another artist's work to train an AI!)

It lets me build for Android and iOS (and more!) with one codebase, which is honestly chef’s kiss. Flutter has been the MVP of my career as a mobile dev. But even in the healthiest relationships, you have fights, right? And me and Flutter... we have some fights. Sometimes it gaslights me. Sometimes I wake up and wonder if I made the right choice.
So this isn’t a hate post. It’s not a breakup letter. It’s more of a... vent. A good ol’ "I love you but what are you even doing right now???" post.

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 
Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.
Is Bitcoin mining profitable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to build Python desktop applications? wxPython is a great choice!
In this guide, we’ll go through:
Installing wxPython
Creating a simple window
Adding buttons and handling events
To get started, install wxPython:
pip install wxPython

Here's a basic wxPython window:
import wx

app = wx.App(False)
frame = wx.Frame(None, wx.ID_ANY, "Hello wxPython!", size=(300, 200))
frame.Show(True)
app.MainLoop()

A basic window titled “Hello wxPython!” will appear.
Let's add a button and show a message when it's clicked:
import wx

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(None, title="wxPython Button Example", size=(300, 200))
        panel = wx.Panel(self)

        self.button = wx.Button(panel, label="Click Me", pos=(100, 50))
        self.button.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.on_click)

    def on_click(self, event):
        wx.MessageBox("You clicked the button!", "Info", wx.OK | wx.ICON_INFORMATION)

app = wx.App(False)
frame = MyFrame()
frame.Show()
app.MainLoop()

wxPython is a powerful and flexible way to create cross-platform desktop apps using Python.

description: "From floating-point quirks to BigInt, learn how numbers really work in JavaScript with examples and best practices."
JavaScript is a powerful and flexible language, but its handling of numbers can be a bit quirky—especially if you're coming from languages like Python or Java. In this article, we’ll break down how numbers work in JavaScript — from basic arithmetic to edge cases you should know.
In JavaScript, all numbers are stored as floating-point values, even if they look like integers.
console.log(typeof 10);       // "number"
console.log(typeof 10.5);     // "number"

JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format.
let a = 5;
let b = 2;

console.log(a + b); // 7
console.log(a - b); // 3

It's highly flexible and covers lots of great features, which saves hours of work.
If you want to dive into theme development, this could be a great contribution for the community.
However, it's easy to miss critical concepts if you don't spend enough time learning how to do it right.
Hugo is a framework, so it has its specificity.
It's impossible to cover everything here, but, roughly speaking, many templates will inherit from generic structures, so you can prevent unnecessary duplication (e.g., HTML markup) just by defining blocks and using hooks:

The product had Lambda functions. It had API Gateway. It had Cognito. It had S3, CloudFront, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, IAM policies, and more. The architecture diagram looked like a subway map. And yet... nobody used it.
The truth is simple: you don't need AWS to build something users love.
There is a common trap that builders fall into. You read a few blog posts or see a diagram on Twitter and suddenly you think your tiny project needs the same architecture as Netflix.
You don’t.
Most early-stage projects die not because they lacked scalability, but because they lacked users. Or because the product was confusing, buggy, or didn’t solve a real problem.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a concept so deeply ingrained in everyday programming practices that ignoring it could almost be considered a cardinal sin, on par with neglecting version control. But why has DI become so crucial?
DI is one of the key principles enabling the creation of flexible and maintainable applications. The philosophy behind it revolves around freeing code from unnecessary details that tightly couple logical components. Components no longer depend on specific implementations of other parts of the system—they simply declare their needs, and DI provides the required dependencies.
The goal here is not just to master a trendy technology but to explore a universal architectural tool whose concepts transcend different ecosystems. Studying DI across multiple lang…]]></summary>

The token’s price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token’s distribution and utility models. 
This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.

Google Online Assessment (OA) for the Summer Internship 2025 is a crucial part of the hiring process. This assessment tests your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and your aptitude for tackling complex algorithms. One of the typical problems you might encounter is transforming a number into a palindromic binary form with the least number of operations. In this blog, we will delve into this problem and provide strategies to solve it efficiently.

You are given a number ( N ) (0 <= ( N ) <= 2 * 10^9), and you can perform the following operation any number of times, including zero:
Increase or decrease the number by 1.
Your task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the binary form of ( N ) palindromic.

Too often, data engineering tasks that should be simple end up requiring heavyweight tools. Something breaks, or I need to explore a new dataset, and suddenly I’m firing up Spark or connecting to a cloud warehouse - even though the data easily fits on my laptop. That adds extra steps, slows things down, and costs more than it should. I wanted something simpler for local analytics that could still handle serious queries.
DuckDB is an open-source, in-process SQL OLAP database designed for analytics.

Because Docker copies your project files into the container when you build the image. Once the container starts, it runs on that static snapshot—isolated from your host file system.
Restarting the container every time you make a change? That’s inefficient.
Enter: Bind Mounts.
Bind mounts allow you to map a file or directory on your host machine to a path inside your running container.
This means:
Your container reads real-time code from your host.

Launching a new token is a critical step for any blockchain project. Token launches enable projects to offer their native assets to early users, investors or supporters while securing capital or encouraging community growth. 
From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. 
Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how…]]></summary>

Follow these steps carefully to resolve the GPG key issue and ensure a clean Docker installation. Run each command exactly as shown to avoid syntax errors.
To avoid conflicts or malformed entries, let’s clean up any existing Docker repository files:
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

Ensure your system has the necessary tools:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

The -y flag automatically confirms the installation.
This step ensures curl and gnupg are available for fetching and processing the GPG key.

O Adapter é um padrão de projeto estrutural que tem como objetivo "traduzir" ou adaptar o funcionamento de um código X para que seja compatível com o código Y.
Imagine que você tem várias classes de pagamento que implementam uma interface comum chamada Pagamento — por exemplo: Pix, Ted e Boleto.
Agora, sua equipe precisa integrar uma nova forma de pagamento, como PayPal, desenvolvida por outra squad ou vinda de uma biblioteca de terceiros. Essa classe PayPal não implementa a interface Pagamento, e isso quebraria o padrão da sua aplicação.
Para resolver esse problema sem modificar a biblioteca externa (o que muitas vezes nem é possível), usamos o padrão Adapter, que atua como um "tradutor" entre as interfaces. Ele faz com que a classe PayPal seja compatível com a interface Pagame…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Mindoro Island is one of the best destinations in the Philippines for spearfishing, offering pristine waters, abundant marine life, and a variety of underwater hunting environments. Whether you're targeting reef fish or pelagic species, Mindoro provides excellent opportunities for both reef and blue water hunting.
The best season for spearfishing in Mindoro is from November to May during the dry season. This period offers calm seas, clear visibility, and more predictable currents. During the rainy season (June to October), conditions can be challenging with strong waves and reduced visibility, especially in open water.
Mindoro's waters are home to a wide variety of trophy fish. Common targets for spearfishers include:
Giant Trevally (GT)
Barracuda
Green Jobfish
Rainbow Runner
Various species of Tuna
Snappers
Groupers

You’ve updated your systems. Applied patches. Everything seems fine.
But no system can be truly secure or efficient without ongoing monitoring.
No logs = No alerts = delayed response to attacks or resource exhaustion

No visibility means attackers could go unnoticed (e.g., unauthorized SSH access)

Unpatched systems or performance spikes might indicate compromise but without monitoring, you'd never know.

A CRON expression is a string with 5 space-separated fields (sometimes 6 or 7 depending on the system) that define a recurring schedule.
┌──────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌──── day of month (1 - 31)

30 14 1 * *
2:30 PM on the 1st of each month


@daily

Every day at midnight


@hourly

Every hour



Always test your expressions using tools like crontab.guru or Cronhub.


This format changes based on the system. For example, the Quartz CRON scheduler has a slightly different format to support extra capabilities, such as seconds and nth recursive patterns, like the 3rd Friday of the month. Similarly AWS Cloudwatch has different one.]]></summary>

The TCP 3-Way Handshake is a fundamental process that establishes a reliable connection between two devices over a TCP/IP network. It involves three steps: SYN (Synchronize), SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge), and ACK (Acknowledge). During the handshake, the client and server exchange initial sequence numbers and confirm the connection establishment.  
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a foundational internet protocol designed to:
reliably (no lost or duplicated packets)

✅ Ensure in-order delivery (packets arrive in the order they were sent)

✅ Provide error-checking (detect and fix corrupted data)
Unlike UDP (which just throws data out, hoping it arrives), TCP carefully sets up, manages, and closes connections.

In today’s world of software development, clarity and maintainability are more valuable than ever. Functional programming (FP) — once considered an academic curiosity — is now a widely used paradigm in real-world applications. But what exactly is functional programming, and why should you care?
Let’s break it down.
Functional programming is a way of thinking about software construction that treats computation as the evaluation of pure functions and avoids changing state or using mutable data.
Rather than telling the computer how to do something (like in imperative programming), you describe what you want done. This leads to predictable, testable, and often more compact code.

The Dubai-based exchange, which processed $1.3 trillion in notional volume last year, is “actively reassessing potential opportunities” in the United States, CEO Luuk Strijers told the FT.
He cited the “recent shift toward a more favorable regulatory stance on crypto in the US” as a key motivator behind the decision.
Deribit’s potential plan to expand into the US comes amid reports that Coinbase is in advanced negotiations to acquire the platform.

What is a color-shifting hover card?
A color-shifting hover card is a type of hover effect that changes the background color of a card or element when the user hovers over it. It is a fun and interactive way to add some visual interest to your website or app. The effect is achieved by using CSS gradients and JavaScript to update the card's background color based on the user's cursor position. You can obviously use solid colors instead of gradients, but gradients are more versatile and can be used for more complex effects…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[💰 Cost Optimization with AWS Compute Optimizer.
“You can’t optimize what you don’t measure.” — This quote holds especially true in the cloud.
In this blog, I’ll walk you through what Compute Optimizer is, how it works, and how I used it in a real-world project to save money without compromising performance.
🔍 What is AWS Compute Optimizer?
EC2 instances
⚙️ How Compute Optimizer Works
Go to the AWS Console.
🧪 Real-World Use Case: Cost Cutting with EC2
We had 6 EC2 instances of type t3.large in a production environment. These handled various microservices with relatively low average usage but had burst workloads occasionally.
Compute Optimizer Analysis:
CPU utilization: <10% average
Switch to t3.medium
We used this migration strategy:
Create AMI backups
No increase in latency
🛑 Things to Keep in Mind
Is this instance intentionally over-provisioned? (e.g., for redundancy or DR)
📦 What About EBS and Lambda?
We had a general-purpose gp2 volume attached to our dev environment with almost no IO requirements.
Compute Optimizer suggested sc1 (cold HDD), and we tested it for archive-type workloads.
✅ Result: No functional issues, 60% storage cost saved.
Lambda
In a different project, our Lambda functions had 1024MB memory allocated by default. Compute Optimizer showed average usage around 200MB.
We lowered to 512MB, which also reduced the timeout rate and improved cold-start behavior.
📊 How to Track the Savings
Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor actual savings
AWS Trusted Advisor → checks for idle load balancers, unused IPs, etc.
🔚 Final Thoughts
🎯 It's free, data-backed, and supports multiple AWS services.
In my experience, implementing even 10–15% of the recommendations led to significant savings — without a single service interruption.]]></summary>

What began as a simple idea evolved through multiple iterations—each one teaching me something about technology, process, and the nature of entrepreneurship itself. This is the story of that journey—from Katacoding to Sigmacasts to Octal Stream—and the insights I gained along the way.
The concept began with Katacoding, a platform offering live, one-on-one online coding lessons via video calls. While the model had promise, it lacked scalability. That realization led to Sigmacasts, a curated series of educational videos on math and computer science. The production process taught me how to craft educational narratives and use video to communicate abstract ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made incredible strides in understanding and generating human language. From chatbots to virtual assistants, AI-powered tools can mimic human conversation, provide customer support, and even write articles. However, despite these advancements, AI will never fully capture human communication. Why? Because human language is deeply rooted in emotions, cultural contexts, creativity, and nuances that AI struggles to grasp.
This Blog explores the key differences between AI-generated language and human communication, highlighting why AI will always fall short of replicating human interaction entirely.
The Complexity of Human Language
Understand sarcasm and irony.
AI Lacks Emotional Intelligence:  AI vs. Human Emotions
Empathy in conversations.
Creativity and Storytelling: A Human-Only Domain
AI cannot create original ideas.
The Power of Personal Experiences Human Storytelling vs. AI
The Role of Cultural and Social Influences
Keep up with new trends in language.
The Importance of Human Connection AI vs. Human Communication
Body language and facial expressions.
Unintended discrimination in responses.
Lack of inclusivity in AI-generated content.
Conclusion:
AI has revolutionized language processing, but it cannot replace human communication. Our ability to connect emotionally, create original stories, and adapt language based on context makes human interaction irreplaceable. While AI can enhance communication, it will always need human guidance to ensure meaningful, ethical, and culturally aware interactions.]]></summary>

“This post will describe how Ethereum 5 years from now can become close to as simple as Bitcoin,” Buterin wrote, arguing that simplicity is key to Ethereum’s resilience and long-term scalability.
While recent upgrades like proof-of-stake (PoS) and Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) integration have made Ethereum more robust, he said that technical complexity has led to bloat…]]></summary>

Operational Technology (OT) underpins the world’s critical infrastructure, think power plants humming with electricity, water treatment facilities ensuring clean supply, or manufacturing lines churning out goods. These systems, driven by Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) setups, and IoT devices, are no longer isolated from the digital threats once reserved for IT networks. 
The convergence of IT and OT has opened new efficiencies but also new vulnerabilities. High-profile incidents, like the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack, which disrupted fuel supply across the U.S. Southeast, spotlight the stakes: unpatched vulnerabilities in OT can cascade into real-world chaos.

Here’s the thing Docker doesn’t stop you from doing dumb stuff. It happily lets you:
Run everything as root
Add shady scripts from the internet
Bake secrets into the image

Introduction: kubernetes’ package manager dilemma
If you’ve deployed anything non-trivial on Kubernetes, you’ve probably been blessed (read: cursed) by Helm. For years, Helm has been the default package manager for Kubernetes apps. Charts, releases, values.yaml, and enough curly braces to give you PTSD. It’s the duct tape that somehow holds your YAML together.
But like every DevOps tool we worship and then meme to death, Helm has started showing its age. What once felt like a brilliant abstraction now sometimes feels like writing YAML that generates YAML to apply more YAML. It’s powerful sure but can also feel like overengineering disguised as a templating solution.

Back in August 2020, Epic Games added its own way to pay inside Fortnite, skipping Apple’s built-in payment system. This broke Apple’s App Store rules, so Apple removed Fortnite from the store. In response, Epic sued Apple, saying the company had too much monopoly and was stopping fair competition.
The courtroom drama went over several years:
September 2021: A judge ruled that Apple was mostly right, but one of its rules—stopping developers from telling users about other payment options—was unfair under California law. Apple had to let developers share links to other ways to pay.


April 2025: The court said Apple broke that rule again. Even after the 2021 order, Apple still charged a 27% fee on outside payments and made it hard for developers to show other payment opt…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today’s fast-moving digital landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are no longer just tools—they’re decision-makers, collaborators, and even strategists. But as these systems grow more autonomous and complex, a pressing question arises: Do we truly understand how AI thinks, learns, and evolves?
The evolving behavior of AI agents isn’t just a technical curiosity—it’s a critical business risk that leaders must monitor closely. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the inner workings of AI agents, explore how their behavior can shift over time, and what that means for businesses across industries.
What Are AI Agents, Really?
Unlike traditional software, AI agents learn and adapt. This ability, while powerful, can lead to unpredictable behaviors, especially as agents interact with new data or collaborate with other agents in a shared system.
The Evolution of AI Behavior: A Double-Edged Sword
Examples of Evolving AI Behavior:
Bias amplification: Over time, AI models may reinforce and amplify hidden biases in training data.
Unexpected strategy development: AI agents in competitive environments (e.g., simulations, financial markets) may develop unanticipated strategies that break norms or ethical boundaries.
These evolving behaviors can introduce operational, ethical, and reputational risks if not properly understood and controlled.
Why Business Leaders Should Care
Autonomy Can Create Blind Spots


Unpredictability Increases Risk Exposure


Regulations Are Coming



Strategies to Manage AI Behavioral Risk
✅ AI Explainability
✅ Continuous Monitoring
✅ Ethical AI Governance
✅ Simulation & Testing
The Future: Human-AI Collaboration with Guardrails
The question is no longer “What can AI do?” but “What is my AI actually doing—and why?”
Conclusion
🔍 Stay informed, stay prepared. The more we understand AI behavior, the safer—and smarter—our future becomes.]]></summary>

1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) with Least Privilege
Best Practice: Adopt a strict least privilege approach with our IAM policies. Assign users, roles, and services only the permissions they require, and enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
Examples:
Do not use root credentials for everyday tasks. Instead, create IAM roles for our services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) and assign specific policies.

We see AAAA is marked for some records. As we know, AAAA stands for IPv6.

nil in the Go Language


In the practice of Go language programming, the use of nil is extremely common. For example, the default type is assigned as nil, the error return value often uses return nil, and multiple types use if != nil for judgment, etc. However, regarding the knowledge point of nil, developers need to have an in-depth understanding of its essence and related characteristics. This article will comprehensively analyze nil around the following core questions:
Is nil a keyword, a type, or a variable?
Which types can use the != nil syntax?
What are the similarities and differences in the interaction between different types and nil?
Why do some composite structures need make(Type) to be used after defining variables?

🔗 RestTemplate – classic and synchronous.
⚡ WebClient – reactive and non-blocking.
🤝 FeignClient – declarative and elegant.
We’ll build a common User model and implement full CRUD operations with all HTTP headers (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type, Accept).

Now we don't write verbose class-based components anymore. Over the years, the React team has introduced a ton of built-in hooks that solve specific problems.
But most of the people only stick with just useState() and useEffect(). But there are a lot of hooks that can improve your understanding and ability to write efficient code. As an experienced developer of React, I have tried to explain each of the advanced & newly introduced hooks with proper real-world code examples. Let's build the best app together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The difference between @RestController and @Controller in Spring Framework lies mainly in how they handle HTTP responses.
@Controller




Used for: Traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) web applications.
Returns: Usually returns a View (like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
ResponseBody: If you want to return JSON/XML instead of a view, you must use @ResponseBody on the method.
Example:
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "hello";  // returns a view named "hello"
    }

    @GetMapping("/api")
    @ResponseBody
    public String api() {
        return "This is JSON or plain text";
    }
}

@RestController




Used for: RESTful web services (APIs).
Returns: Automatically returns JSON or XML responses.
Behavior: It is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody. So every method returns the body directly, not a view.
Example:
@RestController
public class MyRestController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, REST!";  // returns as JSON or plain text
    }
}




Feature
@Controller
@RestController




Returns View?
Yes (by default)
No


JSON/XML by default?
No (@ResponseBody needed)
Yes


Use case
Web UI applications
REST APIs


Combines with
@ResponseBody
Already includes @ResponseBody]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🛡️ Building Self-Healing SaaS Applications with Django & Frappe



What if your SaaS application could detect a cyberattack, recover from it, and keep running — without human help?
In this post, I’ll walk you through building a self-healing SaaS architecture using Django + Frappe, combining security automation, error detection, and real-time remediation — all in one stack.
Traditional SaaS platforms rely on:
Manual monitoring
Reactive fixes
Delayed recovery
In a world of zero-day threats and real-time exploits, this isn't enough.
A self-healing SaaS:

✅ Blocks malicious behavior

✅ Automatically restores services

✅ Notifies only when necessary  



Component
Purpose




Django
Core backend & API logic


Frappe
Metadata-based UI, DocTypes, and permissions


Celery + Redis
Background async healing tasks


Fail2Ban / UFW
Auto-blocking IP threats


Middleware
Attack detection & real-time interception


Audit Logs
Track incidents & healing cycles



Brute Force Login Attack



Middleware detects 5+ login failures from same IP

Stores event in logs

Triggers healing Celery task

Automatically:


Blocks IP via Fail2Ban/UFW

Restarts login module if crashed

Sends healing status alert
⏱️ Total recovery time: < 3 seconds

👤 Human involvement: 0
🔐 Auto-heal authentication abuse

🚫 IP blocking on attack detection

🧰 Restart crashed worker queues (Celery)

🔄 Fix broken DocType workflows

📈 Live dashboards for threat metrics







  
  
  💡 Key Takeaways



Self-healing is not just a trend, it's the future of cyber-resilient platforms.
Django + Frappe offer the perfect balance of flexibility, automation, and observability.
You’re not just building features—you’re building defense mechanisms into the fabric of your product.

Let’s build smarter. Let’s build securely.

A streaming platform wants to stream sport matches commented in English (of course completely legal) for Vietnamese viewers. They demand that the subtitle needed to be translated to Vietnamese with the lowest latency as possible. This blog is a PoC (Proof of Concept) for the translated streaming subtitle, using AWS Transcribe to transcribe the voice to text, Nova Micro to fix the text and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock to translate, with the support of serverless AWS ECS Fargate and Lambda.
Why not using Amazon Translate but use Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock? It is because the streaming videos are in special contexts, using sports vocabulary such as player names, item names which makes AWS Translate cannot identify and translate correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nova funcionalidade: Agora é possível recuperar os nomes dos parâmetros de métodos e construtores usando reflection.
Como fazer:
Use o método getConstructor(...) para obter o construtor desejado.
Em seguida, chame getParameters() para obter um array de Parameter.
Use getName() para acessar o nome de cada parâmetro.
Importante!
Por padrão, os nomes exibidos serão genéricos (arg0, arg1).
Para ver os nomes reais, é necessário compilar o código com a flag:




-parameters


Exemplo com flag:
javac -parameters Usuario.java


Sem essa flag:
Antes do Java 8:
Dependia de bibliotecas externas, como o Paranamer:
Paranamer paranamer = new CachingParanamer();
String[] parameterNames = paranamer.lookupParameterNames(constructor);


Vantagens da nova abordagem:
Evita dependências externas.
Facilita o uso de reflection de forma mais limpa e segura.
🛠️ Como compilar com a flag -parameters:
javac -parameters Usuario.java ReflectionTeste.java


E depois execute:
java ReflectionTeste


🧾 Saída esperada (com -parameters):
true: nome
true: pontos


🔁 Saída sem a flag -parameters:
false: arg0
false: arg1


💡 Importante: Para que os nomes reais dos parâmetros apareçam (nome, pontos), compile com a flag -parameters.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Accenture, IBM, and AWS are all placing bets on Crew AI. Why? Because it makes building and deploying real AI agents possible.
With Crew AI, teams are spinning up agents that:
Launch predictive marketing campaigns
Automate financial back-office ops
Optimize inventory and logistics
And tackle 100+ other enterprise use cases
But here’s the catch: agents are only as good as the data they can reach. That’s where SWIRL comes in.

By pairing Crew AI with SWIRL, you get more than just agents—you get enterprise-ready, data-rich workflows that scale. No custom plumbing. No brittle integrations.
With Crew AI + SWIRL, your agents can:
Connect to 100+ enterprise data sources out-of-the-box
Fetch the most relevant structured/unstructured data across silos
Respect row-level permissions with real enterprise auth
Summarize and answer with your LLM of choice
Plug in easily via zero-code connectors
Want to see this in action?

With the growth of microservices and serverless architectures, it's more important than ever to implement robust authentication mechanisms. Here’s a comprehensive guide on managing authentication in a GraphQL API in 2025.
GraphQL, a query language for APIs, allows clients to request only the data they need. This flexibility makes it popular in modern web applications. However, it also introduces unique challenges in securing endpoints and managing user access.
Authentication in a GraphQL API typically involves verifying the identity of a user or service interacting with the API. Once verified, the API can authorize the user to …]]></summary>

The Blog explore an elegant solution using Compound Pattern to tackle the contextual styling challenge.
Applying a hover effect to a Button is fairly simple, A pure CSS solution is more than enough.
.Button {

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not every week is about shipping cool projects, sometimes it’s just about testing.
I spent the week running through various LocalStack Pro sample apps to make sure everything worked as expected. What I didn’t expect was to get hands-on with a whole bunch of AWS services I’ve barely touched before (and a few I had honestly never even heard of).
SageMaker → Machine learning workflows


RDS → Managed relational databases


Neptune → Graph databases


Step Functions → Orchestration workflows


Glue → Data catalog and ETL


MQ → Managed message brokers


Route 53 → DNS and traffic routing



...plus the usual mix of storage, compute, and API Gateway goodness.
What stood out this week was how much you can learn just by doing. I didn’t plan to dive into graph databases or message brokers, but while debugging and tinkering, I picked up quite a bit.
Having everything local with LocalStack definitely made that exploration easier and less intimidating.
First things first: I need to finish my Meme App (priorities are priorities).
Once that’s wrapped, I’d like to turn some of this accidental learning into small demos and share tips on how to explore unfamiliar AWS services without the usual stress.
If you’ve ever gone down the AWS rabbit hole and come out the other side with new scars and skills, I’d love to hear your story too. Just hit me up on Twitter or LinkedIn. Catch y'all next week!]]></summary>

Without a clear way to authenticate dynamically, AI agents either hit brittle, hardcoded APIs or introduce serious security gaps. That’s why authorization has been one of the biggest missing pieces in the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
When MCP was first introduced, it focused on helping AI agents interact with APIs. But it left out that one critical capability: authorization. For the past six months, the MCP team has been working to change that, building a secure, dynamic authorization layer that can keep up with the unpredictable nature of agentic systems.

Often, when I'm on discovery calls with potential clients, a common question arises: "Do you think building an app for my business is a good idea?" My response can sometimes be neutral—or even disappointing—but there's an essential reason for that honesty.
Statistically speaking, about 90% of SaaS (Software as a Service) startups fail. This fact isn't meant to discourage entrepreneurs but to inject a necessary dose of realism. As a software developer, I notice that of all the apps installed on my phone or computer, roughly 90% rarely get opened after the initial installation.

Now, after rolling it out in real-world systems (and dealing with the chaos that followed), here are the 10 most valuable lessons I’ve learned—what worked, what broke, and how we made it through.
Even with Terraform and Ansible, subtle differences sneak in—especially after a few hotfixes. We had OpenSSL versions drift apart, and legacy clients couldn’t connect after a switch. Version control your infra and regularly diff live configs.
Schema changes are where blue-green deployments get risky fast. One rollout crashed due to a new JSONB column in green that blue’s ORM couldn’t handle. Solution? Versioned migrations…]]></summary>

Thanks to open-source tools, free resources, and a bit of creativity, it’s entirely possible to build a secure, functional crypto token or coin on a budget of exactly $0.
In this article, I’ll walk you through how to do just that—without sacrificing quality, security, or credibility.
If you're building a cryptocurrency on a budget, the Ethereum blockchain is a great starting point. More specifically, the ERC-20 token standard lets you launch a new token by simply writing and deploying a smart contract.
You don’t need to build your own blockchain, manage nodes, or run any servers. Instead, you leverage the security and reliability of Ethereum’s existing infrastructure.

LinkedIn 
This article will only cover VS code extensions that helped me during development. Some of these tools were introduced to me by a friend of mine. You can search for them in the VS extension marketplace 👍
It integrates Draw.io into your VScode. Making creating diagrams a lot easier. This tool is useful for creating a mockup design for the frontend of the web application. 
This is probably one of my favorite Git VScode extensions. A really great tool for visualizing your Git repository commits. I use it to track the commits I made. If you are working with another developer, you can see the commits made by each other in different color trees.
This is a tool that has helped me categorise my projects. I have made a lot of projects and they tend to be scattered. This tool helped me organise them into blocks. Clicking on them takes me to the project workspace immediately.
One of my favorite tools in my VScode workspace. This extension allows you to store you previous terminal session. You can create a configuration, these configuration can store a set of terminal commands. This is great for variety of functions, like Dockerization, Database migration, and API testings.
This is probably my favorite tool out of all the extensions. It prevents the need to add a console.log in my JS files. I can see the output clearly in the console. It boosts my productivity a lot , and I recommend it the most.
I hope this article helped with your workspace productivity. 
Happy coding ! 😄]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Na parte 1 desta série, vimos como o Module Federation permite compartilhar componentes entre diferentes aplicações sem precisar instalar pacotes ou duplicar código. Agora, vamos dar um passo além: como enviar dados de uma aplicação para outra.
Imagine que você tem dois apps:
🔵 MF Consumer  — quem consome um componente remoto
🟢 MF Provider  — quem disponibiliza esse componente
conforme a imagem abaixo:

Vamos supor que o MF Provider tenha um componente chamado App que precisa exibir os dados de um usuário ( nome e email ). Esses dados vêm diretamente do MF Consumer.
No MF Consumer, tem o seguinte:

MF Consumer
Aqui, criei um objeto user e passei como props para o componente Provider , que está vindo do MF Provider.
No lado do MF Provider , defini o tipo das props ( ProviderProps ) e usei os dados recebidos normalmente, como faríamos em qualquer componente React, como segue:

MF Provider
Não é magia. É só React com Module Federation! Ao consumir um componente remoto, você ainda pode passar props normalmente, como se ele fosse local. Isso funciona porque, por baixo dos panos, o Webpack cuida de toda a importação remota — mas o React continua funcionando do jeito que a gente conhece.
Com isso, conseguimos:
Importar um componente remoto com Module Federation
Passar dados para esse componente via props
Exibir esses dados no MF Provider como se tudo estivesse rodando no mesmo app
Acompanhe AQUI como ficou o resultado final.
No próximo artigo, vou mostrar como esse padrão pode ser estendido para eventos e callbacks entre MF Consumer e MF Provider (ex: o usuário clica em algo no Provider e o Consumer reage).
💬 Curtiu? Me conta nos comentários como você está usando MF ou se está considerando aplicar na sua stack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No meu artigo anterior, mostrei como montei um projeto com Micro Frontends usando Rsbuild, Module Federation, pnpm e Lerna , tudo rodando num monorepo. Agora, quero dar um passo além e explicar o “porquê” dessa escolha.
É uma forma de compartilhar código entre diferentes aplicações em tempo de execução. Funciona como se um app pudesse importar um componente diretamente do outro — sem instalar, copiar ou duplicar código.
Exemplo real no meu repositório:
📦 mf_provider(chamo de componente filho): expõe um componente Button
📦 mf_consumer_(_chamo de componente pai): consome esse mesmo Header, remotamente, sem precisar tê-lo no código local
✅ Evita reescrever os mesmos componentes em diferentes apps (pelo menos tenta)
✅ Permite deploys independentes (independência de times)
✅ Melhora a escalabilidade de grandes projetos
✅ Facilita refatorações e testes A/B isolados
✅ Acelera o desenvolvimento com reuso real de UI e lógica
“Você não precisa de Micro Frontends… até precisar.”
Nem todo projeto precisa disso.
🔸 Se o projeto é pequeno e centralizado, pode ser complexidade desnecessária
🔸 Se as equipes compartilham tudo e fazem deploy juntos, MF talvez seja overkill
🔸 Se o bundle não é um problema, pode usar libs compartilhadas internas

There are clear wins: faster prototyping, more exploratory design conversations before touching code, and almost no actual coding (which is a huge relief, I'm more of an organize-ideas person, not a coder).
I followed the tools' lead intentionally, curious to see what they had to offer. But in doing so, I slipped back into early-career patterns, prioritizing feature work and not handling code smells up front. I lost my Monday-ness.
I'm a code whisperer. A wild west code wrangler. The one who could reshape entire systems by refactoring in their sleep.

Lets back up a little bit. I am a front end web developer, and I have noticed a flaw in my peers. It is not always present, but it is certainly prolific. For a job that is existentially deep learning, there is very little focus on how we learn. As a college educator this has always stuck out to me. We know we want to learn backend. But how do we learn back end? That's what I want to help you with. 
In my humble opinion our job isn't necessarily to write code. Our job is to provide value to others by solving problems. Code just happens to be the most effective tool for that.

Here's a deep dive into what it is, why you'd use it, and a step-by-step guide to implementing it in Express.
1.Separation of Concerns
Versioning in headers keeps your URL space clean - clients still call /users instead of /v1/users or /v2/users.
2.Content Negotiation
HTTP was designed around content negotiation. You can leverage the Accept header or a custom header (e.g. X-API-Version) to tell your server which variant of the response to emit.
3.Granular Control
You can version on a per-resource or even per-field basis depending on header values.

Nos últimos dias, mergulhei em um experimento que pode facilitar (e muito!) a vida de quem trabalha com micro frontends no dia a dia.
🎯 Criei um repositório open source usando:
Rsbuild (alternativa moderna e rápida ao Webpack)
Module Federation para isolar e compartilhar componentes entre apps
pnpm + Lerna pra orquestrar tudo de forma leve e organizada
📂 Estrutura simples, mas poderosa:
apps/mf_provider: expõe componentes
apps/mf_consumer: consome via Module Federation
Tudo rodando em paralelo com pnpm dev
🔗 Confere lá e, se curtir, arrocha um like ou manda feedback!
Repositório no Github
O pnpm tem um recurso bem legal chamado Catalogs. Ele serve para definir versões de dependências como constantes, que podem ser reutilizadas nos módulos internos dentro do package.json de cada projeto.
Exemplo:
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
# Define a catalog of version ranges.
catalog:
  react: "^18.3.1"
  react-dom: "^18.3.1"

# Nos módulos internos, consigo reutilizar a versão definida no pnpm-workspace.yaml
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "catalog",
    "react-dom": "catalog"
  }

Outra curiosidade bem legal é a praticidade que o Lerna oferece na criação de um monorepo, permitindo executar vários apps juntos de forma paralela com um único comando, como no exemplo abaixo:
"dev": "lerna run --parallel dev",

Rsbuild + Module Federation se mostrou extremamente simples de estruturar e entender, especialmente se comparado ao uso do plugin com Webpack. No próximo artigo, trarei um exemplo utilizando Vite para termos uma ideia prática.
Até mais.
Curtiu a ideia ou tá explorando algo parecido? Bora trocar ideia.

The Gamepad API represents a significant leap in web technology, providing developers with the ability to access gamepad inputs natively within a web browser. Before this API, developers often relied on browser support for other technologies, such as Flash or native applications, to create engaging gaming experiences on the web. The introduction of the Gamepad API in the late 2010s marked a paradigm shift; it allowed developers to create immersive gaming experiences that can fully leverage console-style gamepad controls within HTML5 applications.
The specification for the Gamepad API was drafted in the W3C Gamepad Community Group and has seen constant evolution since its inception. As of late…]]></summary>

As data systems grow more complex, understanding where your data came from, how it has changed, and who is responsible for it becomes just as critical as the data itself. It’s not enough to know that a dataset exists—you need to know how it was created, whether it’s trustworthy, and how it fits into the broader system.
In this post, we’ll break down three interconnected concepts—metadata, data lineage, and governance—and explore why they’re essential to building transparent, …]]></summary>

Analyst predicts a low VIX (

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score below 18 implied a “risk-on” environment, favoring assets like Bitcoin. 
Peterson’s model, which had a 95% tracking accuracy, predicted a $135,000 target within the next 100 days if the VIX remains low. This aligns with Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, as a low VIX reduces uncertainty, encouraging investment in ri…]]></summary>

The fintech revolution is coming, and at its core lies one of the most underrated innovations of our time — the blockchain ledger. This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies or buzzwords. It’s about the raw cryptographic power that makes trustless, decentralized finance possible.
Welcome to Episode 1 of our new video series breaking down the XRP Ledger (XRPL) — one concept at a time.
🎥 Watch on YouTube
In this episode, we dive into the two cryptographic pillars behind the XRPL and modern blockchain systems:
Hashing: Immutable fingerprints for any data
Encryption: Protecting the integrity and privacy of transactions
Why Hashing ≠ Encryption (and why that matters)
How the XRPL uses these concepts under the hood
Whether you're new to Web3 or building on XRPL, these are tools you must understand.
Most developers know what a hash function is. Fewer understand why it's critical in blockchain consensus, how it supports immutability, or how encryption standards impact financial systems at scale.
This series will bridge that gap — starting here.
SHA-256
Public/Private Key Encryption
XRP Ledger’s core protocol
Blockchain developers
Fintech engineers
XRPL builders
Anyone curious about real-world cryptography in action






📢 Follow the series — we’ll be breaking down the XRPL layer by layer, from consensus algorithms to smart contract integration (Hooks), and more.
➡️ Drop your thoughts or questions below — and let’s build the future of finance, together.

Approximately 80% of XYO’s users are non-crypto natives who are participating in Web3 for the first time, he added.
They include truckers, rideshare drivers, delivery people, and nurses among others, Levin said, adding that “95% convert after onboarding through the COIN app.”

Here's a step-by-step guide to get you set up:
Step 1: Set up your React Native project
If you already have a React Native project, you can skip this step.
If you're starting fresh, create a new React Native project using your preferred method (React Native CLI or Expo).
React Native CLI:
npx react-native init MyAwesomeApp
cd MyAwesomeApp

Expo:
npx create-expo-app MyAwesomeApp
cd MyAwesomeApp

Step 2: Install NativeWind and Tailwind CSS
Now, let's add the necessary packages:

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an over two-month high of $97,300 last seen at the end of February, before the “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in the US, bolstering analyst predictions for a rally driven by “structural” institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows into the world’s first cryptocurrency.

We wrote docs assuming someone would read them. We wrapped our endpoints in auth flows and user interfaces. We expected a person, or maybe a service, on the other side.
But that’s already changing.
AI models are now consuming APIs directly. Not as passive data readers, but as active participants. They parse user intent, synthesize context, and trigger backend actions. They're not just clients. They're intermediaries.
And that changes everything.
When models call APIs, natural language stops being enough.
We like to imagine that models “understand” prompts, but in practice, they just compute probabilities over sequences of text. They don’t grasp nuance the way humans do. A tiny shift in phrasing can derail the whole interaction.

Even skeptics are on board. The report labels cautious employees as "Gloomers" (37% of the workforce), who want tight AI oversight, and "Doomers" (4%), who distrust AI outright. Yet 80% of Gloomers and 50% of Doomers say they’re comfortable using AI at work. That shows widespread readiness, not just enthusiasm from the usual suspects.

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Mongoose and TypeScript, two helper types make your life much easier:
/**
 * Extracts the “plain” shape of your schema—
 * just the fields you defined, without Mongoose’s built-in methods or `_id`.
 */
export type User = InferSchemaType<typeof userSchema>;

/**
 * Represents a fully “hydrated” Mongoose document:
 * your fields plus all of Mongoose’s methods and metadata
 * (e.g. `_id`, `save()`, `populate()`, etc.).
 */
export type UserDocument = HydratedDocument<User>;

export const userModel = model<UserDocument>("user", userSchema);

InferSchemaType


• Produces a pure TypeScript type from your schema definition.
• Use it whenever you need just the data shape (e.g. DTOs, service inputs/outputs).
HydratedDocument


• Wraps your base type T with Mongoose’s document helpers.
• Use it for any function that deals with real, database-backed 
For example, in a repository interface you might write:
export interface IUserRepository {
  findOneByEmail(email: string): Promise<UserDocument>;
  findById(id: Types.ObjectId): Promise<UserDocument>;
  create(
    createUserDto: Pick<CreateUserDto, 'email' | 'password'>,
  ): Promise<UserDocument>;
}

Here, each method clearly promises a “live” Mongoose document (with built-in methods) while elsewhere you can rely on User for pure data shapes—keeping your boundaries and types crystal clear.

Hybrid architectures combine elements of client-server and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems.

Goal:  
Take advantage of both models (client-server manageability + P2P scalability).

  2. Edge-Server Systems (Systems with edge servers)



  
  
  2.1. Definition and location in the network




Edge servers are located at the junction of networks:


Between the corporate network and the Internet (for example, for Internet service providers — ISPs).

Between users and the core of the Internet (for example, CDN servers).

On Jan. 11, 2024, it transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF following a landmark victory against the SEC. This marked a pivotal moment with the SEC’s view that ETFs can offer lower expense ratios and enhanced tax efficiency compared to traditional funds.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sure! Here's a DEV.to style blog post for your project Crop Yield Prediction:
An ML project to empower smarter agriculture decisions
GitHub Repo →
Agriculture remains the backbone of the Indian economy, yet farmers still face unpredictable yields due to varying environmental and input conditions. To tackle this issue, I built a machine learning model that predicts crop yield based on historical and input-based features.
This project is simple, beginner-friendly, and practical.
"How can we accurately predict crop yield based on inputs like rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide use?"
Farmers often rely on experience or guesswork. This model helps bring data-driven decision-making to the field.
The dataset includes:
Area
Production
Crop Year
Rainfall
Fertilizer
Pesticide
📌 Categorical features are label-encoded for model compatibility.
Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (optional for plots)
I trained and evaluated three regression models:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor ✅ Best performer



  
  
  Evaluation Metrics:



R² Score
Adjusted R²
RMSE
Gradient Boosting gave the highest R² score on the test set and was chosen as the final model.
The script allows users to input values for the features and get instant yield predictions.
Clone the repo and run the script locally:
git clone https://github.com/h4ck3r0/crop-yielding-prediction
cd crop-yielding-prediction
python main.py

Add UI with Streamlit or Flask
Integrate with real-time weather APIs
Visual analytics for predictions
This is a practical application of ML in solving a real-world agricultural problem.
🔗 GitHub: h4ck3r0/crop-yielding-prediction

The enemy selects two sets of messages (for example, two lists).


One of them is encrypted, and the enemy is trying to guess which one it is.

Once data has been ingested into your system, the next step is to prepare it for actual use. This typically involves cleaning, transforming, and storing the data in a way that supports analysis, reporting, or further processing. This is where data pipelines come in, and at the center of pipeline design are two common strategies: ETL and ELT.
Although they may look similar at first glance, ETL and ELT represent fundamentally different approaches to handling data transformation…]]></summary>

Using AI to Generate Seed Data for Supabase
Every developer knows the importance of having good seed data for fast testing and development. Manually crafting SQL queries to populate your database with realistic data can be tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex relationships between tables.
SupaSeeder connects to your Supabase instance, extracts the database schema, then you can either generate SQL insert statements or optimized prompts to use with any AI model to generate the seed data you need.
supaseeder.vercel.app 🔥



  
  
  ⚙️ How It Works




Provide Supabase URL & Anon Key

Connects to your database and reads the schema.


Write a prompt

Describe the data you want (e.g. "10 users with 5 posts each").


Pick mode





Prompt Mode: Get optimized prompts to use with any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
Direct Mode: Get complete SQL queries generated using OpenAI
Get SQL output
Copy & paste to your SQL editor or Supabase SQL Runner.
Clone the repository:




   git clone https://github.com/mmvergara/supaseeder.git
   cd supaseeder

Install dependencies:




   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install

Start the development server:




   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev]]></summary>

Two of the most common messaging patterns are queues and topics. While they might sound similar, their behavior and use cases are quite different.
In this post, I’ll explain what they are, how they differ, and when to use each one.
A queue follows a point-to-point communication model: messages are sent by a producer and consumed by only one consumer. Once a message is processed, it is removed from the queue.
Key characteristics:
Each message is processed by one and only one consumer.
Guarantees single delivery of each message.

Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.
Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Spring Boot and JPA, understanding how transactions and the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() operation interact can make or break your application's data consistency and performance. Yet, I often see even experienced developers overlook the nuances!
Many believe that committing a transaction is the only way to persist changes to the database. However, the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() method forces the persistence context to synchronize with the underlying database immediately-without ending the transaction. This can be a game-changer for scenarios where you need to validate constraints or trigger database actions before the transaction completes.
But here’s the catch: improper use of 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() can lead to unexpected behaviors, performance overhead, or even data inconsistencies if not handled carefully. It's crucial to know when and why to use it, especially in complex microservices or batch processing environments.
How do you approach transaction management and flushing in your Spring Boot projects? Have you ever faced a tricky bug or performance issue related to this? Share your experience or tips in the comments-let’s learn from each other!

Dependency Injection (DI) is one of the most debated design patterns in software development. While opinions vary on whether it’s universally beneficial, one thing is certain: DI can be extremely useful if not treated as a "golden hammer." Overusing it, such as blindly injecting every dependency, can lead to unnecessary complexity rather than cleaner code.
In this article, we’ll explore how DI can be effectively applied in Next.js, striking the right balance between maintainability and simplicity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vector search is becoming a core workload for AI-driven applications. But do you really need to introduce a new system just to handle it?
We ran a performancebenchmark to find out: comparing PostgreSQL (using pgvector + pgvectorscale) with Qdrant on 50 million embeddings.
Sub-100ms query latencies
471 queries per second (QPS) on Postgres—11x higher throughput than Qdrant (41 QPS)
Head to the full write-up for a deep dive into our vector database comparison.

At 99% recall, Postgres delivers sub-100ms query latencies and handles 11x more query throughput than Qdrant (471 QPS vs. Qdrant’s 41 QPS).
The results show that thanks to pgvectorscale, Postgres can keep up with specialized vector databases and deliver as good, if not better performance at scale. Learn more about why Postgres wins for AI and vector workloads.
How? We built pgvectorscale to push Postgres to its limits for vector workloads—without compromising recall, latency, or cost-efficiency. It turns your favorite relational database into a high-performance vector search engine.
✅ No extra systems.
✅ No new query languages.
✅ Just Postgres.
We used RTABench to run a transparent, reproducible evaluation—designed for real-world, high-scale workloads.
Curious about the architecture behind it all?

It dives into how we engineered Timescale to handle time-series, vector, and relational data—all in one Postgres-native platform.

I see DevOps Engineers as master planners who understand the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Success in this role requires both technical expertise and strong communication skills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As Ether’s price has struggled in the first quarter of 2025, a US-based investment adviser firm, Two Prime, has dropped support for ETH and adopted a Bitcoin-only strategy.
After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.
The firm’s shift to a Bitcoin-only approach comes as ETH has lost 45% of its value year-to-date, with some optimists speculating that ETH is potentially close to the bottom and reversing its negative trend soon.

HTTP is the foundation of everything we build and interact with on the web — whether it’s a static website, a complex Single Page Application (SPA), a RESTful API, or a modern mobile app.
Every user action that triggers data exchange — from submitting a login form to loading an image — ultimately depends on HTTP.
Despite this, many developers treat HTTP as a black box: something that “just works” behind the scenes. While abstraction is useful, serious web developers must move beyond it.
Understanding how HTTP actually operates — from how requests are structured, to how connections are established, to how responses are transmitted — is essential for building high-quality, secure, and performant applications.

But what exactly are AI dating pictures, and are they a good idea? Let’s break it down.
AI dating pictures refer to profile photos that are either:

Multi currency, aka exchange rate management
Time-zone management
Ages have passed, but those topics keep staying in the top 5 chart of my headaches-giver topics.
Just today, scrolling in my LinkedIn wall, I've found an interesting article from Nick Doelman that pointed to another article from 2021 where he solved the long-standing issue of updating exchange rates in the platform in an way that is
straightforward
elegant
deterministic
fast to set-up
and, above all, free!
It's just a matter of leveraging the right tools, that in this case are:
https://exchangeratesapi.io/: a website that provides daily updated exchange rates with a compelling licensing model that allows up to 100 api calls per month for free!
a simple Power Automate flow.
Take a look at his article for details!

According to a May 2 Financial Times report, the ban on borrowing to fund crypto purchases is one of the upcoming crypto rules by the FCA. David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, told the FT that “crypto is an area of potential growth for the UK, but it has to be done right.” He added:
“To do that we have to provide an appropriate level of protection.”
Geale denied claims that the FCA is hostile to the crypto industry. Instead, he explained that he views the industry as offering high-risk investments with less consumer protection. “We are open for business,“ he said.

Kepler is a monitoring and observability tool designed for Kubernetes clusters that uses eBPF to track the resource usage of containers and nodes. Unlike traditional monitoring solutions, which often rely on metrics collection agents running in user space, Kepler utilizes eBPF to gather resource consumption data directly from the kernel. This results in high precision and low overhead, which is essential for cloud-native environments.
Kepler is particularly useful for:

You might be laughing a bit here. Of course .json and js goes hand in hand. Since the beginning of time we have used .json files to throw in config, mock data or see how many levels of data-indentation we can reach before we go crazy.
Well, what I want to do is have a data.json file where I "mock" all the data I want/need for a page so:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🧵 Interfaces in Java, explained like you're 5!



  
  
  1️⃣ Imagine a Pizza Menu 🍕


You walk into a pizza place and see a menu. The menu promises what pizzas they offer—but doesn’t make them yet.

An interface in Java is like that menu: it defines what a class should do, but not how!  
The menu says:  
"All pizzas must have cheese 🧀"

"All pizzas must be bakeable 🔥"
Any chef (class) who follows this menu must fulfill these rules! In Java, we call this "implementing an interface."







  
  
  3️⃣ Multiple Menus, One Chef!


A chef can follow multiple menus (interfaces):  
Italian food menu 🍝

Fast food menu 🍔
Similarly, a Java class can implement many interfaces at once! (Unlike inheritance, where you only get one parent.)







  
  
  4️⃣ But… What If the Chef Cheats? 😱


If a chef says, "I’ll follow the pizza menu!" but doesn’t add cheese… BIG PROBLEM!

Java won’t allow this—it forces the class to implement every method in the interface, or the code won’t compile!  
What if some pizzas usually have tomato sauce, but not always?

Interfaces can now provide default methods—like a "standard recipe" that chefs can override if they want!  

java
interface Pizza {  
    default void addSauce() { System.out.println("Adding tomato sauce!"); }  
}]]></summary>

You might have heard of Schrödinger’s Cat — the thought experiment where a cat in a box is both alive and dead until you check. That's basically an Optional, right? A value that might exist... or not.
So, let's turn this idea into code:
enum 📦<Value> {
    case 😺(Value)
    case 😵

    init(_ from: Value) {
        self = .😺(from)
    }
}

Now we can do:
let x: 📦 = .😺(123)
let y: 📦 = .😵

But that's not quite as convenient as Swift's native syntax: let x: Int? = 123.
Can we make ours feel just as nice?
Swift lets types conform to ExpressibleByNilLiteral. Let’s do that:

A well-designed app is intuitive, engaging, and keeps users coming back. On the other hand, a poorly designed app frustrates users, leading to uninstalls and negative reviews. With millions of apps competing for attention, a flawless UI/UX design can be the game-changer that sets your app apart.
Users appreciate an app that is easy to navigate. A cluttered and confusing interface overwhelms users, leading to higher bounce rates. Simplicity doesn’t mean your app should be bare-bones, but rather that it should be free from unnecessary elements that distract from the core functionality.
Minimize distractions by using a clean and structured layout. Every element should have a clear purpose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We need ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to enable communication between devices on a local network. Specifically, ARP is used to map an IP address (logical address) to a MAC address (physical address), which is necessary for data transmission at the data link layer.
ARP is a Layer 2 protocol used in IPv4 networks to map a known IP address to its corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) address. While IP addresses help devices find each other logically, MAC addresses are what Ethernet networks use to actually deliver packets. ARP acts as the translator between these two.
IP works at Layer 3 (Network Layer) but to actually send data over Ethernet (Layer 2), the system needs the MAC address of the destination device.

O Facade é um padrão de projeto do tipo estrutural. Ele consiste na criação de uma classe intermediária (ou fachada) que expõe uma interface simplificada para um conjunto de classes ou processos mais complexos.
Seu principal objetivo é desacoplar a lógica de negócios da complexidade de múltiplas instâncias e chamadas internas, permitindo que outras partes do sistema interajam com uma interface unificada e mais limpa. Isso melhora a organização do código, facilita a manutenção e reduz a dependência direta de implementações internas.

Why do we need a typography component?
Consistent typography is key to keeping your website looking clean and organized. Without it, things can start to look messy fast. A typography component helps keep text styling uniform across your whole site. The idea here is to make it both flexible and well-defined, so you get a good balance between structure and creativity, since not everything is just black and white. ‘]]></summary>

Under the new Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR), credit institutions, financial institutions and crypto asset service providers (CASPs) will be prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts or handling privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies, such as Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).
“Article 79 of the AMLR establishes strict prohibitions on anonymous accounts [...]. Credit institutions, financial institutions, and crypto-asset service providers are prohibited from maintaining anonymous accounts,” according to the AML Handbook, published by European Crypto Initiative (EUCI).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to part 4 in the series of shell scripting. Today we will look at a script that goes through an array with complex values. Complex values such as spaces, apostrophes, and quotes.
Scripting is the process of writing a set of instructions in a programming or scripting language to automate tasks that would otherwise be done manually. In the context of shell scripting, these instructions are written for the command-line shell, allowing users to perform complex operations - like file management, backups, or software installations - with just a single script execution. It's a powerful tool for saving time and ensuring consistency in system administration and development workflows


Create the script in VIM, complex_list.sh



Write and save the script in VIM.



We can check whether it has been created  by doing ls -ltrh.



Give the permission so the script can be executed.



If we then do a ls –ltrh we can see the script has gained a green colour, meaning that it is now executable.



Output after executing the script by using the command ./




  
  
  Stay tuned, part 5 in the series coming tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excelorithm, we build custom software solutions for startups, SMEs, and enterprise clients alike. And as the technical head here, I’ve seen a recurring pain point — many teams, including our own, spend way too much time setting up the basics of a SaaS product: authentication, subscriptions, dashboards, role management, notifications...
Sure, there are tons of SaaS starter kits out there, both free and premium. They promise speed — and often deliver — but usually at a hidden cost: vendor lock-in.
Many popular boilerplates rely on proprietary services, paid APIs, or tightly coupled ecosystems. That might be fine early on, but over time it limits your freedom, raises your costs, and ties you to someone else’s roadmap.
That’s why we built SaaSLaunchpad — a free, open-source Next.js SaaS starter kit with zero paid tool dependencies and no vendor lock-in.

Anyone who has used traditional payment systems will likely be familiar with refunds and chargebacks. If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.
However, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.

Among the open-source offerings, DeepSeek-R1 models stand out due to their strong performance in coding, logical reasoning, and problem-solving tasks.
This guide explains how to install and run DeepSeek-R1 models locally using Ollama, and optionally expose them securely online using Pinggy. It's aimed at developers and IT professionals who want a self-hosted, offline-capable, and customizable LLM stack.
Running models like DeepSeek-R1 on your local machine offers several practical advantages:
Data stays local – no external server or API receives your prompts.
Zero cloud usage limits – you control the compute resources.

Bitcoin long-term holders are about to hit a level of unrealized profit, which has traditionally caused them to sell.

That level coincides with the return to a six-figure BTC price.

Order book data suggests that bulls may not succeed in keeping the upside going.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “notable increase” in selling from its older investors if price rises further, warns onchain analytics firm Glassnode.
In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” researchers calculated that long-term holders (LTHs) are sitting on almost 350% unrealized profits.

Fair source software is a licensing model designed to balance the freedom of open source with the revenue potential of proprietary software. This blog post explores the history, core concepts, practical applications, challenges, and future innovations of fair source software. By blending aspects of open access with commercial monetization, fair source software offers an alternative ecosystem where developers can engage communities while earning sustainable revenue. We also compare fair source with traditional licensing models using tables and bullet lists for clarity. Furthermore, we discuss additional facets such as funding strategies and legal complexities that shape this emerging model in the digital landscape.

But exactly is the purpose of the Node Operators in the Catalysis Ecosystem? well let's get into that now.
They power the services (AVSs) by doing important technical tasks.
They also help protect the network by locking up funds (called 
staking)—this keeps them honest.
If they do something wrong, they can lose money so they have a 
strong reason to act fairly.
I'm pretty sure at this point you can fairly understand why they are called the backbone of the network. Basically without them nothing would work.
HOW DOES CATALYSIS WORK IN RELATION TO THE NODE OPERATORS?
Normally, running these services on many platforms is complicated and 
expensive.
Catalysis simplifies this by giving them one tool (Catalyst-CLI) 
to manage everything in one place.

Any service that's meant to live more than couple of weeks eventually reaches the stage where you feel the need to properly monitor it. You usually start with simple console.log logging, but soon realize it's not readable enough, it's not searchable enough and it's only available on your server. Probably inside Docker container.
I was exactly at that point, annoyed by constant need to ssh into my server to check one log line. I've wanted to play with Grafana ecosystem for a while, too. So it seemed to be the perfect moment.
In this post, I’ll walk you through a simple and minimal setup that streams my Node.js application's logs into the Grafana Cloud dashboard using Grafana Alloy and Loki.

Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition.
AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality. 
Yet another strand of prevailing research seeks to explore the feasibility and implications of AG…]]></summary>

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin (BTC) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs. However, that’s since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post.
“Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a gamble mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach,” he said.
“This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains,” Quinlivan added.

The agency didn’t give a reason for wanting to dismiss its case, but said its decision “does not necessarily reflect the Commission’s position on any other case.”
Balina told Cointelegraph in March that the SEC had informed him it would recommend the court dismiss the case and claimed the agency’s actions were based on a shift in the agency’s priorities.

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token.
If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled.
Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.”

“What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role quickly turned into an intelligence-gathering operation,” the company wrote in a May 1 blog post.
Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview.
Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used.

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Two Pointers, String, Dynamic Programming
There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.
After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

        <updated>2025-05-02T00:43:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By default, Spring Data JPA loads related data lazily, which can cause the N+1 problem — one query for the main data and more for each related item. @EntityGraph annotation fixes this by letting you load related data in a single query, without changing your entity mapping. It’s simple, improves performance, and avoids writing custom JOIN FETCH queries.
Let’s say you have a Post entity that references an Author.
Entities
@Entity
public class Post {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String title;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Author author;
}

@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}

Repository
public interface PostRepository extends JpaRepository<Post, Long> {

    // attributePaths specifies related entities to eagerly load
    @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"author"})
    List<Post> findAll();
}

Now, if you create a simple controller to return all posts and have SQL logging enabled, you'll see the queries printed in the console.
With @EntityGraph, only one query runs to fetch both the post and its author. Without it, multiple queries are executed — one for the posts and one for each author — which is the N+1 problem.
✅ Using @EntityGraph
Only one query — fast and efficient.
select p.id, p.title, a.id, a.name
from post p
left join author a on p.author_id = a.id

🚨 Not Using @EntityGraph
N+1 queries — slow and wasteful.
select * from post;
select * from author where id = ?;
select * from author where id = ?;]]></summary>

O LangGraph é uma extensão do LangChain que permite construir fluxos de execução orientados a grafos para LLMs e agentes. Em vez de seguir uma sequência fixa de passos (como num pipeline tradicional), você define nós (nodes) e arestas (edges) que representam o comportamento dinâmico do sistema.

When working with data structures like lists or NumPy arrays in Python,

the standard print or pprint, or even external tools like rich, often fail to provide a clear view of the entire structure,

especially when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or deeply nested data, making it easy to lose track of which element corresponds to which.
Let's consider the following example as an illustration.
sample = [
    {"user": {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "scores": [95, 88, 76]}},
    {"user": {"id": "002b", "name": "Bob", "scores": [72, 85, 90]}},

According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets.

According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

Despite weak US manufacturing data, Federal Reserve liquidity plans and strong corporate earnings keep equities and crypto afloat.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March.

Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “decoupling” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment.

In an interview with Cointelegraph's Sam Bourgi at Token2049, Elissar said that stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, the intersection between AI and crypto, alternative use cases such as decentralized science, and Web3 gaming were all niches the company is exploring.
Gaming is "part of our DNA," the executive said before reflecting on the current state of the Web3 gaming industry:

“I think it’s a missed opportunity,” Independent Reserve founder Adrian Przelozny told Cointelegraph. “Neither side has made crypto a headline issue because they’re wary of polarizing voters or sounding too niche.”
But the good news is that after more than a decade of inaction, both the ruling Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the opposition Liberal Party are promising to enact crypto regulations developed in consultation with the industry. 
In April, Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor promised to release draft crypto regulations within the first 100 days after taking office, while the Treasury itself h…]]></summary>

According to reporting from Inner City Press, a judge sentenced Eisenberg to 52 months in prison at a May 1 hearing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case was filed in April 2024 after Eisenberg’s 2023 indictment on fraud for the Mango Markets exploit.
Eisenberg was initially scheduled to be sentenced in July 2024 following his guilty plea on the child porn charge.

The company said in its May 1 earnings statement that its year-to-date Bitcoin (BTC) yield equates to a gain of more than 61,000 BTC, worth approximately $5.8 billion. Bitcoin yield and gain are unofficial accounting metrics Strategy uses to benchmark the success of its BTC buys.

In a May 1 letter to Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) — the entity responsible for managing the US government’s properties — Rep. Lance Gooden claimed that introducing crypto ATMs to federal buildings would serve as an “educational resource” and reflect advances in financial technology.

He added that though crypto firms had to follow regulations, there was a “fear of compliance” among companies in the EU.

According to the announcement, the project relies entirely on donations, does not have venture funding, and does not have any pre-mined token allocations or a governance token. The project's team wrote in a May 1 X post:
"General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance. Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call — the rollup grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance."
"Most L2s today are acting more like new L1s than an Ethereum scaling solution — private allo…]]></summary>

Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $96,955 on Bitstamp, its highest since Feb. 22.
Increasingly close to six figures, Bitcoin rose with US stocks at the Wall Street open as Microsoft gained 10% to become the world’s highest-valued public company.
Reacting, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades suggested that stocks may be on the cusp of a return to sustained bullish trajectory.

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Major European cryptocurrency investment firm 21Shares has filed for a spot Sui exchange-traded fund (ETF) in the United States, marking another step in its expansion to the US market.
21Shares on April 30 submitted the Form S-1 registration for a spot Sui (SUI) ETF to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Called the 21Shares Sui ETF, the proposed ETF will issue common shares of beneficial interest by seeking to track the performance of SUI held by 21Shares’ US subsidiary.
The US filing comes a year after 21Shares started trading the 21Shares Sui Staking exchange-traded product in Europe in July 2024, with its first listings on Euronext Paris and Euronext Amsterdam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the intensifying global race to tokenize real-world assets, the market is still too nascent for institutional adoption, according to Chris Yin, the co-founder and CEO of Galaxy-backed RWA platform Plume.
Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

According to a May 1 Bloomberg report, the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026. The plan is still in early development, and the bank is said to be exploring partnerships with established crypto firms to power the service. Internal discussions about cryptocurrency support reportedly began in late 2024.

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates sooner than expected.

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

Imagine you're sitting in your favorite coffee shop, casually browsing your bank account on public Wi-Fi. Everything looks normal—padlock icon, HTTPS, the familiar interface. But in the shadows, a silent observer is watching, recording, and possibly altering everything you send. This is not science fiction; it's the chilling reality of a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack.
With the explosion of remote work, IoT devices, and public connectivity, MITM attacks are more relevant than ever. For developers, IT professionals, and security teams, the danger lies in the illusion of secure communication. The article you're about to read dives deep into how these attacks operate, the real-world damage they cause, and how to guard against them.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Conditional Rendering?


In React, conditional rendering allows you to dynamically render different UI components based on certain conditions. You can use JavaScript logic such as if statements, the ternary operator (? :), the logical AND (&&), or assign JSX to variables.
Using if Statements


The simplest way to conditionally render components is by using if statements inside a function component.
Example:





function AlertMessage({ show }) {
  if (!show) {
    return null;
  }
  return <p className="alert">This is an alert message!</p>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <AlertMessage show={true} />;
}

In this example, if show is false, the component returns null and nothing is rendered.
Using Ternary Operator (? :)

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

While MongoDB's native driver and tools like Mongoose offer ways to work with the database, Prisma ORM provides a complementary approach that enhances the development experience.
MongoDB stores data in collections of JSON-like documents with flexible schemas. This flexibility enables rapid iteration and adaptability to changing requirements. Prisma ORM complements this flexibility by providing:
Type-safe database access: Generated TypeScript types based on your schema.


Clear schema management: A declarative schema that documents your data structure.

Have you ever run a SQL query that just took forever and wondered, "Why is this so slow?" You're not alone. Databases are fast until they're not. And one of the simplest, yet most powerful performance tricks in SQL is indexing.
What indexing really means in MySQL 


Why indexes are performance game changers


The exact results of an experiment we ran on 80,000+ records in 


MySQL 5.7 on a local setup (8GB RAM, SSD)


When indexing helps and when it doesn't



Let's dive in.

Think of an index like a book's table of contents. If you need Chapter 8, you don't flip through every single page you jump straight to it. That's what MySQL does with an index.
Primary Index(based on the primary key)
Unique Index (for ensuring uniqueness)
Composite Index (on multiple columns)

Hello everyone! Welcome to the second entry in my reading journey series. This time I have managed to read only 5 books. While I’m a little bit behind on my Goodreads goal of reading 52 books in the year, the last couple of months have been very busy with the end of the academic winter term. Now that I’m done with classes, I’m sure that I can have more time for reading and hopefully catch up to my goal. Let’s go into the reviews for this entry!

I briefly mentioned in the last entry that I was starting to read a collection of Celtic fairy tales and lore that my dad gifted me for Christmas. The first book in this collection is Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland by Lady Wilde. It contains a varied recollection of folklore and fairy tales.
Overall, I liked…]]></summary>

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

After doing my first job as a frontend engineer in a startup for an year, I left my job. Their are multiple reasons for it, but that was the story of another time.
After that I decided to not pursue the tech career and start my chocolate factory - HAKI, a chocolate spread idea that crossed my mind.


If anyone is thinking, why making a chocolate spread would be so hard, like I thought initially, my 1st two variants caught fungus within a week.

Long time, messaging a hundred people for advice and many failed attempts, now I'm here finally — with the most delicious recipe made using clean, wholesome ingredients to keep it truly healthy.
Ahh and please follow Haki on @eathaki_ to know more about it.

We're still on the lookout for a graphic designer who's excited to help build HAKI — feel free to drop me an email if someone comes to mind.
Thank you so much for reading it till here 😊

Also, if there's a better place to share this, please let me know.]]></summary>

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…]]></summary>

In an April 30 filing in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), lawyers for Coinbase argued that a First Circuit Court of Appeals decision set a “dangerous precedent” for crypto users, potentially allowing the government to “trace users’ every crypto transaction in the past and monitor every crypto transaction in the future.” The appeal to the Supreme Court stemmed from petitioner James Harper, a Coinbase user, who took legal action against the IRS after the crypto exchange was forced to turn over transaction data to the government using a sweeping “John Doe…]]></summary>

Stablecoins’ cumulative market cap currently stands at roughly $230 billion, but “[e]volving market dynamics [have] the potential to accelerate stablecoins’ trajectory to reach ~$2tn in market cap by 2028,” the Treasury said in the April 30 report. 
A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar. According to the report, such tokens are already “ubiquitously utilized as ‘cash on-chain,’ effectively serving as a new payment mechanism.”

Bitcoin’s price increased by sixfold each time its age increased by 40%.

If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could rally to $351,046 in 2025.

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

Tether’s flagship stablecoin, USDT (USDT), is already the US dollar’s top “exporter,” Ardoino told CNBC. It has a market capitalization of nearly $150 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 
Now, Tether is preparing to expand into the US market “by the end of this year or early next year, at the fastest,” Ardoino said, adding that the timing depends on US lawmakers’ progress on stablecoin legislation. 
The stablecoin issuer is working to woo US regulators by proactively collaborating with law enforcement and highlighting USDT’s benefits for the US economy.

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.

According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally. Several analysts are also optimistic that Bitcoin’s break will occur to th…]]></summary>

In an exclusive interview, Markova described the competition with dollar-pegged stablecoins as “all about sovereignty.” She compared the situation to earlier tensions between governments and US payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamic with stablecoins — on a smaller scale for now — but they’re definitely emerging as a new arena for sovereign concerns,” she said.
According to Markova, dollar-pegged stablecoins operating in the European Union are already "having a massive headache," particularly from central banks. "Even tho…]]></summary>

US GDP shrank -0.3% in Q1, far below +0.3% forecasts, sparking recession fears.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023. Polymarket odds of a recession in 2025 hit 67%, with consumer confidence at its lowest since May 2020.

Speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on April 30, Zhao said that areas of the United Arab Emirates were “extremely pro-business,” leading to crypto adoption in Dubai, while others like Bhutan were building national Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) stockpiles. According to Zhao, the US was pressing other countries’ hands by exploring its own policies for a crypto reserve, but those in Europe didn’t seem to be reacting.
“I don’t see Europe in this discussion,” said Zhao, highlighting one exception. “Montenegro is actually quite pro-crypto. We had an active dialogue with [the] prime minister there, and he’s a very forward-thin…]]></summary>

US GDP shrank in Q1, raising recession alarms while also prompting calls for Fed rate cuts.

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support. 

Today’s crypto derisking is likely transitory; market fundamentals remain strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…]]></summary>

Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it. 
This is not the first time products have been revealed to be inauthentic, with the Honey Authenticity Network highlighting that one-third of all honey products were fak…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[April 2025 witnessed crypto markets rocked by more tariffs at the direction of US President Donald Trump — controversial policies that could have influenced the outcome of Canada’s elections on April 28. 
On April 2, Trump levied “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on 185 countries and territories. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,200 points on April 4, while the S&P 500 dropped nearly 6%, its largest decline since March 2020. Bitcoin (BTC) went along for the ride but broke from stocks as it recovered toward the end of the month. 
Blockchain adoption metrics for Ethereum are looking good, as the network now boasts 60% real-world asset (RWA) tokenization value. Major firms like BlackRock are sure the blockchain will be the standard for RWAs, but other observers believe that scaling is…]]></summary>

In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy.
The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…]]></summary>

Partial outages: Another system could be in maintenance mode, limiting your access.
Network instability: Users with slow internet connections might experience short outages or timeouts.
Overloaded service: Another service could be overloaded with requests, leading to slow responses.
Networks are unstable, and you will suffer such problems sooner or later.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a modern approach to provisioning cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or OpenTofu. These technologies improve scalability, repeatability, and automation—but they can also introduce security risks if the code is misconfigured. For example, exposing an S3 bucket to the public or disabling encryption can lead to serious data breaches.
This article introduces CoGuard, a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool designed specifically to analyze configuration files used in infrastructure code. We’ll demonstrate how to scan Terraform code, interpret results, and automate the scanning process in a CI/CD workflow.

Firefox is a powerful, free, and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. The journey of Firefox began in **2002, when it was initially launched under the name *“Phoenix”. Due to trademark conflicts, it was later renamed *“Firebird”, and finally, in **2004, it became known as *“Firefox”*.
The main objective was to offer a lightweight, secure, and flexible browser alternative to the then-dominant Internet Explorer. Firefox quickly became popular due to its faster performance, tabbed browsing, and support for third-party **extensions (add-ons).
Over time, Firefox introduced several innovations such as:
Private Browsing Mode
Enhanced Tracking Protection
Reader Mode
Quantum Engine for improved speed and performance
Today, Firefox remains one …]]></summary>

Released in late 2024, MCP provides a universal way for AI assistants to securely connect and interact with external data sources, APIs, business software, and development tools.
Even advanced LLMs often operate in isolation, limited by the data they were trained on and disconnected from live information or the ability to act within external systems. Connecting AI to these services traditionally involved building custom, difficult-to-scale integrations for each data source.

Whether you're building a website, web app, or just dabbling in JavaScript, these common mistakes can cause your code to behave unexpectedly or inefficiently. 
Don’t let these issues hold you back! In this post, I’ll dive into 7 common JavaScript mistakes and provide practical solutions to avoid them. 
Let’s take your JavaScript skills to the next level! 💻🚀

Using var Instead of let and const


We all know JavaScript has come a long way, but some developers still rely on var. This can lead to unexpected behavior due to its function-scoped nature. let and const are block-scoped, providing better predictability in your code.

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, 2025 has ushered in a paradigm shift known as vibe coding. Coined by AI researchers, vibe coding represents a transition from traditional, syntax-heavy programming to a more intuitive, AI-assisted approach where developers articulate their intentions in natural language, and AI tools generate the corresponding code.
At its core, vibe coding is about conveying the desired functionality or behavior of software through conversational prompts. Instead of meticulously writing out code line by line, developers describe what they want the software to do, and AI models translate these descriptions into executable code. This method emphasizes clarity of thought and design over manual co…]]></summary>

Will AI Take My Job?
Anita Olsen ・ Apr 22
#discuss
        #ai
      
Sure, we code daily and AI shines at spitting out code. But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.
Apart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:
Inter-team planning
Brainstorming sessions
Putting late sprints back on track
Designing requirements and user stories
Decomposing a full project into milestones
Scoping tasks with Product people
Reviewing architecture designs
Negotiating deadlines
Talking to clients
And that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn't surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can't replace that human interaction yet.
But sure, our job as coders will change. Even if we're skeptical about AI, we can't ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us. We have to adapt.
We won't be code monkeys anymore, cracking lines of code in exchange for bananas. AI will handle that. And if AI will change everything, let it at least kill dumb SCRUM ceremonies.

Tornado Cash users led by Joseph Van Loon had sued the Treasury, arguing that OFAC’s addition of the platform’s smart contract addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list was “not in accordance with law.” 
OFAC had sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, accusing the protocol of helping launder crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking collective, the Lazarus Group.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Australia’s financial intelligence agency has told inactive registered crypto exchanges to withdraw their registrations or risk having them canceled over fears that the dormant firms could be used for scams.
There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals.
The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they’ll be told to “use it or lose it.”

In an April 29 X post, tech commentator Jacob Canfield shared a scam letter sent to his home via post that appeared to be from Ledger claiming he needed to immediately perform a “critical security update” on his device. 
The letter, which uses Ledger’s logo, business address, and a reference number to feign legitimacy, asks to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s private recovery phrase under the guise of validating the device.
The letter threatens that “failure to complete this mandatory validation process may result in restricted access to your wallet and funds.”

Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.

If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.

Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening.

The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession.
The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours.

Fidelity Digital Assets says Bitcoin is undervalued and the firm holds an optimistic mid-term outlook.

The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. 

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” 
As proof,  the firm cited the ‘Bitcoin Yardstick’ metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network. 
In Q1 2025, the metric stayed between -1 and 3 standard deviations, cooling from its Q4 2024 overheated levels. The number of days above 2-standard deviations dropped from 22 to 15, …]]></summary>

The US regulator has delayed its deadline for ruling on the proposed ETF listings until June, according to two filings reviewed by Cointelegraph. 
The filings were responses to March requests from US exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX Exchange to list Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and Franklin Templeton’s XRP (XRP) ETF, respectively. 
They came on the same day that Nasdaq, another US exchange, asked for permission to list a 21Shares Dogecoin ETF.

Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals.

In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.

Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors’ inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.

Europe’s second-largest neobank, Bunq, is expanding into cryptocurrency, citing growing retail investor demand for digital assets worldwide.
The Amsterdam-based neobank announced the launch of Bunq Crypto on April 29, a new offering enabling its users to invest in over 300 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL).
Starting April 29, Bunq users in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Belgium will be able to access cryptocurrencies directly through the Bunq app, according to an announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways: 

Fidelity Digital Assets’ report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum's layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.
The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin’s favor.

The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF, shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Polkadot (DOT). 
Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund. The request amounts to a regulatory review process that could determine whether Dogecoin becomes accessible to a broader range of investors through an ETF structure.

In an April 29 notice, the UK government announced draft rules for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), that would bring “crypto exchanges, dealers and agents” in line with regulations, as many residents were “exposed to risky firms and scams.” It cited discussions with US government officials, including a proposed US-UK cross-border sandbox from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Hester Peirce.
“Today’s announcement sends a clear signal: Britain is open for business — but closed to fraud, abuse, and instability,” said the notice. “The government will bring forward final cryptoasset leg…]]></summary>

AI has been a dominant narrative since 2024, but users and companies still cannot completely trust it. Whether it’s finances, personal data or healthcare decisions, hesitation around AI’s reliability and integrity remains high.
This growing AI trust deficit is now one of the most significant barriers to widespread adoption. Decentralized, privacy-preserving technologies are quickly being recognized as viable solutions that offer verifiability, transparency and stronger data protection without compromising AI’s growth.

Bitcoin’s most recently-moved supply segment is increasing as higher prices see an influx of “speculative capital.”

“Hot supply” has doubled in just five weeks versus local lows in March.

Active address numbers have yet to mimic a classic bull market comeback.

Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders (STHs) are back in the game as a “speculative capital” enters the market.
In an X thread on April 29, onchain analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency compliance firm Bitrace found that $649 billion worth of stablecoins flowed through addresses classified as high-risk in 2024, according to an April 29 report.
Bitrace defines high-risk blockchain addresses as those used by illegal entities to receive, transfer or store stablecoins.
Crypto compliance firms typically score crypto wallet addresses based on their likelihood of involvement in illicit activities. The higher the risk, the higher the likelihood of foul play, and the less likely compliant crypto businesses are to accept the assets.
Per the report, the amount accounted for roughly 5.14% of all stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. This is down 0.8% from 5.94% the previous year, but significantly higher than the 2.8% reported in 2022 and 1.63% in 2021.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.
