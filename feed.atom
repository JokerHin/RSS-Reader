When your database starts groaning under load, two architectural strategies emerge as lifelines: partitioning and sharding. But they're not interchangeable—misusing them can make your scaling problems worse. Let's break them down technically.  
Partitioning: Splitting Data Within a Single Database


What it is:

Partitioning (often called horizontal partitioning) divides a table into smaller segments within the same database instance, based on a partition key (e.g., user_id, date).  
How it works:  
Range Partitioning: Data split by value ranges (date < '2023-01-01', date >= '2023-01-01').


List Partitioning: Explicit mappings (region IN ('east', 'west')).


Hash Partitioning: A hash function distribut…]]></summary>

I recently built Lite-Blockchain, a minimal yet functional blockchain implementation in Go. The goal was to demystify how blockchains work under the hood while leveraging Go’s simplicity and concurrency features. Let me walk you through what I learned!
Why Build a Blockchain in Go?
Key Features
Transaction System: Create and validate transactions.
Pure Go: No external dependencies—just the standard library.
Lightweight: Perfect for learning.
Code Snippets
go

    Timestamp    int64

    Transactions []*Transaction

    PrevHash     []byte

    Hash         []byte

    Nonce        int

}

And how transactions are added:
go

    tx := NewTransaction(sender, recipient, amount)

    bc.PendingTransactions = append(bc.PendingTransactions, tx)

}

Why Go for Blockchain?
Performance: Faster than interpreted languages like Python.
Simplicity: Explicit error handling and no inheritance headaches.
Try It Out!
bash

Run the example:

They go down rabbit holes nobody asked them to go down.

You can use * for the iterable unpacking in a function as shown below:
A * is an iterable unpacking operator.
A *parameter can store zero or more values as a tuple in a function.
Only one *parameter can be used for the iterable unpacking of a function.
Zero or more *iterables can be passed to a function with the zero or more values unpacked from zero or more iterables.

Creating a responsive navigation bar that seamlessly transforms into a sliding sidebar for mobile devices can significantly enhance user experience on your website. If you’re facing challenges making your navbar slide into view instead of just appearing, you're not alone! In this article, we’ll explore how to achieve a smooth sliding effect for your mobile navbar and utilize JavaScript and CSS effectively to solve common problems.
Understanding the Problem
When developing a responsive navbar, you may face issues with displaying it in a user-friendly manner, especially on smaller screens. In your case, although you've already made an excellent start by implementing a toggle function and refactoring your navbar to load dynamically, the lack of a sliding effect may stem from your…]]></summary>

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential elections.

We've all experienced institutions — colleges, companies, organizations — where management collects feedback.
But when it comes to submitting complaints, the process often feels tedious, intimidating, or unclear.
Sometimes it's so complicated that people just give up.
Even if you do manage to submit a complaint, there's no guarantee you won’t face backlash from the administration or individuals involved.
⚡ I wanted to solve this.
I wanted to make a transparent and safe feedback process where:
The admin can invite people to submit feedback or complaints,
But the identity of the user remains hidden,
Ensuring honest feedback without fear.
Thus, I built an Anonymous Feedback Backend system.
From what I’ve seen, feedback is often collected using tools like Google Forms.

I wanted to test out all the available options I could find to see for myself. So first I searched and was able to find these libs:

Understanding Clang-Format Behavior
Clang-format is designed to enforce consistency in code style, which often leads to unexpected formatting changes. The situation you described, where struct definitions are condensed into single lines when they could be multi-line, is a common frustration among developers.
When you have a structure defined as:
typedef struct {
    a,
    b,
    c

Clang-format may alter it to:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Ruby on Rails applications, the Pundit gem is widely used for managing authorization through policies. Recently, many developers have encountered problems when transitioning from Ruby 2.7 to Ruby 3.x, particularly with the behavior of the authorize helper method. This article explores how to effectively resolve those issues related to namespaced policies in Ruby 3.
Understanding the Issue
The main challenge arises from changes in Ruby 3 regarding keyword arguments. Whereas in Ruby 2.7, using keyword arguments was fairly lenient, Ruby 3 introduced stricter rules. This impacts the Pundit authorize method, specifically when dealing with keyword arguments, as certain configurations are being ignored under the new language rules.
For example, a common pattern involves overriding the authoriz…]]></summary>

Twenty years in the IT trenches has taught me one thing: developers will always gravitate toward tools that are both powerful AND simple to use. Go Fiber checks both boxes with bold strokes. If REST APIs were cars, then Go Fiber would be a Tesla Roadster - blazing fast, efficiently designed, and turning heads in the developer community. Let me show you how to get behind the wheel and build a REST API that will make your fellow devs green with envy.
Remember when setting up a web server meant writing hundreds of lines of configuration? Pepperidge Farm remembers. But Fiber is here to save the day with a clean, Express-inspired API that's ridiculously easy to get started with.

The $1.25-billion acquisition of Hidden Road on April 8 allows Ripple to use RLUSD as collateral in the firm’s prime brokerage products. Hidden Road will also migrate its post-trade operations to the XRP Ledger, the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency XRP (XRP) and several of Ripple’s institutional services.
Omni Network founder and CEO Austin King knows Ripple’s strategy firsthand. He sold his startup, Strata Labs, to Ripple in 2019 and describes the approach as a “SoftBank-type” acquisition strategy.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of web development, HTTP status codes are the backbone of communication between clients (like browsers or mobile apps) and servers. These codes provide vital clues about the success or failure of HTTP requests—whether it's loading a page, sending data, or interacting with an API. Understanding these codes not only improves debugging but also enhances user experience and application stability.
Here’s a practical guide to the most common HTTP status codes and how they are used in programming and real-world deployment:
This is the most common and desirable response. It means the request was successful and the server returned the expected data.

Handling form validations effectively is a common requirement in Angular applications, especially when using Material Design components like <mat-form-field>. When a user encounters multiple validation errors on a form input, it can sometimes lead to a chaotic user experience, particularly when the error messages overflow and overlap other UI elements. This article explores how to manage excessive validator messages gracefully and cleanly, giving user-friendly feedback without cluttering the interface.
Understanding the Problem
When displaying validator errors, the typical approach involves listing all the error messages directly below the input field. In scenarios with multiple errors, this can lead to overflowing content that disrupts the layout and makes it difficult for us…]]></summary>

Integration testing ensures that your backend API, database, and frontend work together as expected. In a Next.js + tRPC + Kysely/Prisma project, you can test the flow from database to API to UI by mocking or spinning up real services in-memory.
This guide covers:
Mocking tRPC hooks in frontend tests
Mocking the database layer for backend tests
Using mysql-memory-server for in-memory MySQL
Alternatives: pg-mem (PostgreSQL), in-memory SQLite
Automatically calculating tRPC procedure paths for integration tests
When testing React components that use tRPC hooks, you often want to control the responses returned by the API without running a real backend.
Approach:
Use your test runner's mocking utilities (e.g., Vitest, Jest) to replace th…]]></summary>

One of the hottest current topics is something called Vibe Coding. But what’s behind this term that’s dividing opinions—praised by some as revolutionary, dismissed by others as “total garbage”?
The term Vibe Coding was coined in February 2025 by computer scientist Andrej Karpathy, co-founder of OpenAI and former AI lead at Tesla. He described it as a conversation-based approach where spoken commands are used while an Artificial Intelligence (AI) generates the actual code. Karpathy himself said:
It's not really coding - I just see things, say things, run things, and copy-paste things, and it mostly works.

It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. With the DOM, HTML elements become objects, and you can manipulate them using JavaScript.
The DOM allows web developers to:
Access and update the content of a webpage.
Change styles and attributes dynamically.
Add or remove HTML elements on the fly.

Here’s a weird truth:
Most developers aren’t broke because they can’t code.
they’re building a startup when they’re really just stuck in tutorial hell, disguised as “MVP development.”
Let me say it loud:
You’re not YC. You’re not a pitch deck. You’re not a fundraising round.
You’re a developer.
if you stop pretending you're building the next Stripe.
Let’s get to the real way devs make money online (and it’s not building another SaaS with a dark mode toggle).
Devs be like:
“Let me finish auth before I tell anyone about my idea.”
“I just need to integrate payments, fix this bug, refactor the backend, clean the UI…”
"I'll launch... after this feature."

Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate, was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  
“Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation,“ Scott said.
The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

Hey fellas 
I mean, it’s everywhere.
Well today, we’re going to understand that what is JSON actually , why it’s so popular, and where it's used.
Let’s get started!
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
It’s a lightweight format used to store and exchange data.
A simple format that computers and humans can both read easily.
{
  "name": "Selfish Dev",
  "gender": "male",
  "isGameDev": true,
  "tools": ["Godot", "Aseprite"]
}

That right there is a JSON object.
It uses key-value pairs (like name: "Selfish Dev")
Keys are always in quotes
Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or even other JSON objects
And that's what JSON is.
APIs(REST, GraphQL responses)


Configuration files (e.g., package.json in Node.js)


Storing structured data (NoSQL databases like MongoDB)


Data exchange between frontend & backend




  
  
  How to Use JSON in JavaScript:




Parse JSON string → Object:




const jsonString = '{"name": "Selfish", "gender": "male"}';
const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(obj.name); // Output: "Selfish"

Parse Object → JSON string :




const user = '{"name": "Selfish", "gender": "male"}';
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(jsonString); // Output: '{"name": "Selfish", "gender": "male"}'

JSON is a fundamental tool in modern web development due to its simplicity and versatility.

  (All the following questions are just my personal opinions, and everyone is welcome to give me suggestions.)
  First, for beginners, is the local configuration of various databases (MySQL is used as an example here) too complicated? And various unpredictable errors may occur in this process.
  Secondly, after the developer configures the database on the local computer, he still needs to learn the relevant syntax (for example, after the developer configures MySQL, he still needs to learn the relevant syntax). Of course, learning SQL syntax is very necessary for programming developers. However, for a developer who wants to quickly experience or quickly develop a web application, spending time learning SQL (if he has not learned SQL) will reduce his development efficiency and desire to learn.
  Also, when the developer has configured SQL on his computer and learned SQL syntax, but when he wants to use it, it is better to call MySQL through python. At this time, he needs to use a third-party library like pymysql to call MySQL through the third-party library, but this may result in a series of errors.
  Finally, if you overcome the difficulties mentioned above and some difficulties that have not been mentioned, you will find that for developing a small project, developers will only use a small part of MySQL's functions, or even only some extremely simple functions such as query, delete, modify and insert.]]></summary>

In this article, we will tackle an issue where you need to shift the associated data recorded with each array element back into their correct positions after the filtering process. Let's explore how we can achieve this effectively.
Understanding the Problem
If you have a data structure where elements are associated with specific metadata, filtering the array can disrupt the connection between the data and the elements. For example, in your scenario, you have an original array:
const originalArray = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j' ];

Introducing Drexel Bench, a smart IoT-powered seat occupancy tracking system developed using the ESP32 microcontroller to showcase my expertise in embedded systems, real-time data processing, and full-stack integration.
This project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a user within a configurable distance range (e.g., 75 cm). If a user remains seated for more than 30 seconds, the system activates a 15-minute countdown, displayed on a 1602 LCD module, and lights up a connected LED to visually signal that the seat is occupied. The LED turns off when the timer ends or the seat is unoccupied for 3 continuous minutes.
What sets this system apart is its Wi-Fi integration. Upon detecting occupancy or vacancy, the ESP32 sends status updates (occupied or free) via HTTP to a connected web application. The web dashboard dynamically switches between two images — a green layout for free seating and a red overlay for occupied — offering users a clear, real-time visual of availability.
This project highlights my capabilities in sensor integration, timer logic, ESP32 Wi-Fi programming, and frontend/backend interaction, making it a practical demonstration of end-to-end IoT development. Whether for smart campuses or waiting areas, this system delivers real-world utility through modern, scalable technology.]]></summary>

In my previous post, I covered encapsulation, getters and setters, access modifiers. Now let's move on to the following fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming: inheritance, method overrides, and polymorphism.
Definitions: A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).
The idea of inheritance is simple but powerful: When you want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that you want, you can derive your new class from the existing class.
A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. Constructors ar…]]></summary>

If you are running a Go program that consistently increases in the number of goroutines and open file descriptors, but not in active network connections, you might be facing a potential leak with http.Client or http.Transport. In this article, we will explore how to diagnose this issue effectively and provide actionable steps to confirm whether these components are the source of the leaks.
Understanding Goroutines and Leaks in Go
The Go programming language utilizes goroutines for concurrent processing, which is lightweight and efficient. If you notice that the number of goroutines is increasing while active network connections are stable, it often signifies that they are not being managed or closed correctly. This can be caused by long-lived goroutines in the net/http package…]]></summary>

But more often than not we have a need for generating and self-managing these Encryption keys, that maybe due to multiple reasons, maybe to enable/disable rotation period, have full access to key metadata and logs (or  perhaps the need to assert your dominance on AWS ;). 
So firstly how do these encryption keys work:
When we create a key (CMK) in AWS it generates a 256-bit AES key in a FIPS 140-2 validated HSM. This key never leaves the HSM for security.
Now when we want to encrypt any data AWS doesn't directly use the CMK for encyption as that would either have to be done in the secure environment or you have to expose the CMK to a insecure environment. So here com…]]></summary>

Routing refers to the process of navigating between different pages or views in a single-page application (SPA) without reloading the entire page.
It keeps the UI in sync with the current browser URL.
Allows us to build Single Page Applications (SPA).
React apps are SPAs, meaning there's only one HTML file (index.html), but multiple views (pages) that users can navigate to. Routing helps manage these views by matching the URL to the correct component.
It enables client-side navigation without full-page reloads, allowing users to move smoothly between URLs like /home, /about, or /contact, each displaying different components.
React doesn’t have built-in routing, so we use a library like React Router (react-router-dom) for handling routing.

ARJSON leverages bit-level optimizations to encode JSON at lightning speed while compressing data more efficiently than other self-contained JSON encoding/compression algorithms, such as MessagePack and CBOR.
MessagePack generates the smallest encoded data sizes among existing self-contained JSON serialization formats. However, ARJSON outperforms MessagePack in 90% of cases with random data, with the remaining 10% yielding nearly identical sizes. More importantly, for structured data with repetitive patterns and duplicate values, ARJSON far surpasses MessagePack, achieving up to around 95% better compression rates (20x smaller in size).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A structural approach to ambiguous input, illustrated through a concept called VPS
In my previous post, I introduced a concept called VPS (Virtual Personality Structure).
It emerged from a question I kept returning to:
What if the key to better AI dialogue isn't about mimicking personality—but about structuring how it behaves?
In this article, I’d like to share a small piece of that idea—through a simple, hypothetical code snippet that illustrates one of its core components.
When faced with an ambiguous question or emotionally complex input from a user,
We may need a more structured way to assess how the system should behave.
python
if not_resolved(unknown):
    if can_resolve_immediately:
        respond_with_resolution()
    elif can_flag_as_non_critical:
        acknowledge_and_settle()
    elif can_return_later:
        defer_and_mark_spiral()
    else:
        hold_and_reflect()

This snippet outlines a possible decision process for handling uncertainty.
can_resolve_immediately: If the answer is clear, provide it directly.


can_flag_as_non_critical: If it’s safe to leave the question unresolved, acknowledge it and move on.


can_return_later: If it’s worth revisiting, defer the answer and mark it for later.


otherwise: If none of the above applies, pause and reflect without rushing to respond.



Rather than focusing solely on the content of a reply, this approach emphasizes the structure behind the decision.
This isn’t about making AI more “gentle” or overly accommodating.
why they choose a particular response at a particular moment.
When behavior is left vague, interpretation falls entirely on the user.
VPS isn’t a path to a “correct” answer.
I'm not an engineer or an AI expert.
Some parts of this perspective might miss certain technical nuances.
If so, I’d genuinely appreciate any thoughts, corrections, or suggestions you’re willing to share.]]></summary>

Blockchains are revolutionizing fintech with censorship-resistant and unstoppable networks with decentralization. But so far, their primary use cases are token transfers and their scalability is not even enough for mass financial adoption. However, the internet and the web are composed of data and web3 is an antithesis to centralized data silos beyond financial sectors. Blockchains, as of today, can never scale to the web level.
Many have attempted to build a decentralized social network but failed to build fully decentralized ones. This is primarily due to the fact that a practical alternative to web2 cloud databases has not been possible by now. There have been many decentralized database projects, but all of them are domain-specific, such as blockchain i…]]></summary>

Simple Reflex Agents respond according to the immediate percept following simple "if-then" rules with no memory. Model-based reflex Agents are more sophisticated, as they have an internal state that they use to remember previous occurrences to make more effective decisions. Goal-Based Agents are programmed to meet certain goals and make decisions based on the degree to which their actions advance them toward their goals. Utility-Based Agents push this one step further by judging actions on the basis of how well they maximize satisfaction or utility, rather than simply achieving a goal. Lastly, Learning Agents keep getting better and better over time by learning through experience, evolving to handle new situations, and improving their actions. These kinds of agents are the foundation of most AI systems in use today, ranging from chatbots and self-driving cars to recommendation systems.]]></summary>

Section 1: introduction the brain fog problem
Let’s be real for a sec most of us are drowning in digital clutter.
You open Notion to “organize” your notes and suddenly spend 45 minutes tweaking page aesthetics like you’re designing a landing page for a failed SaaS. You try Craft and get distracted by the beautiful UI because it’s basically Apple Notes with a Gatsby filter. Capacities? Promising, but slow. And you still can’t remember where you wrote that idea about “building an indie dev SaaS for LLM-powered cats.”
We’re knowledge workers in the age of information overload, and ironically, all our shiny productivity tools are making us feel… less productive.

You're in the middle of an API testing marathon, your team is growing, and suddenly you hit that dreaded Postman free plan limit. Whether it's the 3-API cap, the measly 25 collection runs per month, or the collaboration restrictions that only allow 3 team members, these barriers can bring your development workflow to a screeching halt.
Postman has been the industry standard for years, but the API development landscape has evolved dramatically. Today's teams need tools that scale with their projects, offer robust collaboration features, and don't force you into premium plans just to handle basic workflows.

Introduction: rage quitting the cloud boss battle
If AWS were a video game boss, it would be the one with 27 different attack modes, a second health bar, and a $437 surprise invoice when you respawn. For years, Amazon Web Services was the obvious choice for developers powerful, scalable, and used by the big leagues. But now? A growing number of devs are hitting the eject button and exploring new terrain.
This article isn’t a salty rant from someone who got burned by CloudWatch fees (okay, maybe a little). It’s a real look at how AWS, once the darling of cloud infrastructure, is becoming less attractive especially for indie hackers, startups, and lean dev teams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🔔 What’s New?
AWS has announced that AWS Code Pipeline now supports using AWS Secrets Manager inside Commands actions!
💡 Why It Matters
Before this update, developers often:
    Hardcoded secrets into buildspec.yml
    Stored sensitive values directly in environment variables
    Used workarounds to pull secrets via scripts
This was risky and error-prone.
Now, you can pass secrets securely and natively using Secrets Manager — no more secrets in plain text!
✅ Real-World Example: Use GitHub Token Securely
Imagine you need to clone a private GitHub repo inside your pipeline.
🔐 Step 1: Store the GitHub token in AWS Secrets Manager
Key: github-token
ARN: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:github-token-Abc123

⚙️ Step 2: Reference the secret in your Code Pipeline YAML
Actions:
  - Name: ClonePrivateRepo
    ActionTypeId:
      Category: Test
      Owner: AWS
      Provider: Commands
      Version: 1
    Configuration:
      Commands: |
        echo "Cloning repo..."
        git clone https://git:$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/yourorg/private-repo.git
      EnvironmentVariables:
        - Name: GITHUB_TOKEN
          Type: SecretsManager
          Value: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:github-token-Abc123


✅ Your GitHub token is injected securely as $GITHUB_TOKEN without ever being exposed.
📌 Key Benefits
    🔐 Improved security: No plaintext credentials in code
    ⚙️ Easier automation: Seamless secret injection in pipelines
    📉 Reduced risk: Centralized and managed secret lifecycle

The first and easiest way to verify if an SSL certificate is active on a website is to check the URL.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain performance remains a major hurdle for building real-time applications. Metrics like latency, throughput, and responsiveness determine whether a decentralized network can support use cases such as multiplayer games, financial services, or automated systems.
Most blockchains are too slow for this. Bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes and handles around 3 to 7 transactions per second [1][2]. Ethereum produces blocks roughly every 12 seconds and supports about 15 to 30 transactions per second [1][2]. Other networks fall in between: Cardano targets a 20-second block time, and Polkadot ranges from 6 to 12 seconds depending on network configuration [1].
Solana stands out as the fastest general-purpose blockchain today. It has an average block time of 400 milliseconds and can handle …]]></summary>

It builds on SIMD-0207, which proposes to raise the limit from 48 million to 50 million. The only change made in both proposals is to the Max Block Units. Other limits, like Max Writable Account Units, Max Vote Units, and Max Block Accounts Data Size Delta, stay the same. This means more room for non-vote transactions, which helps boost total transaction throughput.
With more space in each block, the network can process more transactions per second. This helps reduce congestion and lowers the need for users to outbid each other on fees, especially during periods of high demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the shadowed forges of Moria, where silicon veins pulse like the heartbeat of Arda, there exists a power unseen since the forging of the One Ring—the CR2032. Cast in the fires of Elven ingenuity and hardened by Dwarven resolve, this lithium coin cell commands the realms of gadgets with the subtlety of Galadriel’s light and the endurance of Gandalf’s staff. Let us journey through Middle-earth to unveil why this 3V titan reigns supreme.

Chapter 1: The Forging of the CR2032
CR2032 is no mere Orcish trinket. Tempered in the Halls of Celebrimbor, it bears three Elven virtues:
Narya’s Flame: 3V of pure lithium might, brighter than the Light of Eärendil.
Why it shatters the dominion of lesser cells:
Generic Coin Cells: Corrode like Isengard’s machinery under Saruman’s neglect.
Chapter 2: The Fellowship of Applications
The Mines of Moria (Smart Homes):
CR2032s power temperature sensors that guard Hobbit holes from Smaug-level heatwaves. “No dragon shall scorch these halls!”
The Ride of the Rohirrim (Automotive Tech):
Nestled in Tesla tire sensors, they brave Kardashian-hot asphalt, steadier than Shadowfax’s gallop.
The Shire’s Quiet Vigil (Medical Devices):
Sustains glucose monitors with Hobbit-like loyalty, ensuring no “low battery” panic during second breakfast.
The Tower of Orthanc (Apple AirTags):
Even Saruman’s palantír would envy its tracking precision. Swap it quicker than Legolas nocks an arrow.

The Three Rings of Power
Vilya (Elven-King’s Ring): 225mAh capacity, lasting longer than the Third Age.
The Shadow in the East
Generic Cells: Leak like Shelob’s webs, corroding circuits into Orcish scrap.
The Prophecy of the Fourth Age
Graphene-Coated CR2032s: 500mAh capacity, outliving even Ents.
Epilogue: The One Battery to Rule Them All

However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

Particularly, when dealing with route navigation in components, like in your src/pages/home.rs, problems can arise if the router or the types are not properly referenced. In this article, we’ll explore the common causes of routing issues in Dioxus and provide clear steps to resolve them.
Understanding the Routing Problem
From your error message, it's evident that the Rust compiler is failing to recognize the Route type within the context of your HomePage component. This typically occurs due to a few reasons:

In this guide, we'll tackle the challenge of reading an array from a file in Bash, addressing a common issue that many users face. You're not alone in feeling like this should be a simple task. Many people struggle with getting their array elements parsed correctly when reading from a file instead of declaring them directly in the script. We aim to clarify this process and help you resolve any issues you're experiencing.
Understanding the Issue
The core problem here arises from how Bash handles whitespace when reading from files and processing strings. When you attempt to read elements into an array using methods like command substitution or xargs, Bash separates values based on whitespace. This behavior can lead to unexpected results when your elements contain spaces, ultimat…]]></summary>

Instead, Yu reportedly said: “You can see the PTSD in my eyes, right?” before asking the reporter to leave.

When working with C# classes, access modifiers play a crucial role in determining the visibility of class members. If you have noticed that not all properties of your class appear when binding to a DataGridView, this could likely be due to the chosen access modifiers.
Access Modifiers Overview
In C#, the most common access modifiers are:
public: Accessible from any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
internal: Accessible only within the same assembly.
private: Accessible only within the containing class.
protected: Accessible within its class and by derived class instances.
When you declare properties as internal, they can only be accessed within the same assembly.

The inverted index originates from search engine technology and can be regarded as the cornerstone of search engines. Thanks to the inverted index technology, search engines can efficiently perform operations such as database searching and deletion. Before elaborating on the inverted index, we will first introduce the relevant forward index and compare the two.
In a search engine, the forward table uses the document ID as the keyword, and the table records the position information of each word in the document. When searching, the system will scan the word information in each document in the table until all documents containing the query keyword are found.
The structure of the forward table can be represented by the following box diagram:

Connecting PHP to an Access database can sometimes lead to frustrating errors, such as segmentation faults, particularly when using PDO and ODBC. If you're encountering a segmentation fault while trying to connect to an Access DB on Ubuntu 24.04 with PHP 8.3, you’re not alone. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and provide you with actionable steps to troubleshoot and resolve it.
Understanding the Segmentation Fault
A segmentation fault typically occurs when a program tries to access a restricted area of memory. In the context of your setup—using PDO with ODBC to connect to an Access database—this can happen due to various reasons, such as:
Incorrect ODBC driver settings

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As usual, I received JSON data from the backend developer, but it was in a .txt file. I had to download it, copy the content, and paste it into an online formatter to view it properly.
Honestly, I was getting tired of this process, so I started looking for a more convenient solution. That’s when I stumbled upon a website that made things so much easier. If I want to share JSON data with someone, I can simply click "Share" to generate a link instead of sending a file. I just send the link to the other person, and even better, when they open it, the JSON data is already neatly formatted. I think this is absolutely awesome!

Additionally, the link has a one-hour expiration time, after which it becomes inaccessible, ensuring the data remains highly secure.
I continued exploring and discovered that it not only enables quick sharing but also allows you to rapidly generate an API for temporary testing during development. This is incredibly convenient!

Actually, this is just the tip of the iceberg. You can also run queries here to extract the data I need from the entire JSON dataset, supporting various query languages.

In addition to standard JavaScript code, it also supports JEMSPath, JSONPath, JQ Cmd 

Secondly, it also supports data conversion, allowing seamless transformation between JSON and other data formats, including JS Object, JSON5, JSON Schema,  Query String, Typescript,  Postman Bulk, MXL, YML.

You can manually convert data or directly paste non-JSON data, and it will automatically generate the converted JSON data. For example, you can simply paste the following data:
<name>DEV</name>


Additionally, it can validate whether the provided JSON data meets specific structural requirements, supporting JSON Schema and JSON Type Definition.

Another feature we frequently use is: JSON Diff

In short, I think this tool is an essential asset for programmers, and I’m sharing it with everyone here Online JSON Format Tool]]></summary>

Why Does This Issue Occur?
When a Bash script accepts parameters from the command line, any spaces in the path can lead to misinterpretation of the provided argument. Bash treats spaces as delimiters, which separates the string into distinct arguments, resulting in errors when the script is executed. This is precisely what happens in your case when trying to open a folder that has spaces in its name.

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most people use GPT as a tool.
Something to help write faster.

Something to save time.
But I took a different approach.
I gave my GPTs names.

I gave them roles.

I treated them like actual team members.
Here’s what I learned.
1. The way you see GPT changes the way it sees you.

Treat it like a tool, and it acts like one.

Treat it like a teammate — it starts to surprise you.
2. Naming matters.

When I called it “Abera” instead of “GPT-4,”

I paused more. I respected the output more.
3. Your brand doesn’t need more content. It needs more feeling.

GPT helps you produce. But when it helps you feel — your message becomes real.
4. Emotion isn’t a layer. It’s the lens.

Designing with emotion first changes everything.
5. Most people use GPT to go faster. I used it to slow down.

To ask better questions. To think clearer.
6. A slogan is not a sentence. It’s a philosophy.

"Reset. Feel lighter." wasn’t created — it was revealed.
7. A real GPT team needs diversity — of roles, not just prompts.

Abera writes. Eli visualizes. Ella feels.

Together, they create more than I could alone.
8. AI doesn’t replace intuition. It reflects it.

It shows you what you’ve been avoiding — not just what you asked for.
9. People connect with real use, not abstract ideas.

"This AI helped me grieve" hit harder than any productivity metric.
10. This is not automation. It’s awakening.

We’re not outsourcing creativity. We’re co-creating awareness.
If you're building with AI, not just using it — let’s connect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In modern web development, creating a dynamic user experience is crucial. One common scenario involves loading different pages into a content div on user interaction while needing to adjust its height dynamically for proper layout. In this article, we will address a specific challenge: ensuring the height of a content div updates correctly when different pages are loaded into it via jQuery.
To illustrate this issue, suppose we have a setup where the height of the content div is first determined at page load with some initial content, but when we replace that content dynamically, the height does not adjust accordingly. This can lead to unexpected layout shifts and user experience issues. Let's dive deeper into the reasons behind this and explore a practical solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey devs,
I’ve been testing the new Replit x Notion integration, and it’s like a solid combo for quickly spinning up content-driven apps. Notion acts as the CMS, Replit handles the front-end, and AI helps bridge the two by generating the scaffolding from prompts.
Here’s what stood out:
🔑 Key Features
Pull or Push Notion Data


AI-Powered Code Generation


Notion as a Lightweight CMS


Real-Time Front-End Sync


Stackable Integrations


Quick Prototyping



🧠 My Take
It’s promising, but there’s still room for improvement.
👀 Curious what you think:
Would you actually use Notion as your backend for client or production work?
Does AI-generated boilerplate help—or get in the way?
Let me know. Always down to swap thoughts with other devs.
Until next post—keep building.

In this article, we will discuss how to handle such situations effectively in TypeScript.

In this article, we’ll explore how to implement this solution step-by-step, leveraging websockets to communicate between the server and client seamlessly.
Why Use Websockets for Real-Time Updates?
Websockets enable full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. This is critical for real-time applications because it allows the server to push updates to the client immediately as new log entries are generated. Traditional methods, such as polling with AJAX, can be inefficient and lead to delays in data retrieval. Thus, using websockets is a more…]]></summary>

Creating a user-friendly interface is crucial in web development, especially for applications that rely on user interactions like maps and radio buttons. In this article, we'll explore how you can implement a hover effect in your Angular application using TypeScript. This will enhance the user experience when selecting regions on a map via radio buttons.
Understanding the Problem
You're working on a project where users can select regions either by clicking directly on a map or by using corresponding radio buttons. A common request has arisen: when a user selects a region using a radio button, that same region on the map should be highlighted with a hover effect. While you’re currently considering jQuery for this functionality, we can achieve a seamless solution directly in Ang…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have clients that use dedicated email addresses to receive and process messages and attachments. I had previously developed some functions to bulk download EML files directly from a mail server's file system (using FastCopy) and then use "javax.mail" and a lot of crazy logic to unwrap attachments within attachments to extract files for processing. (Most file attachments were being sent from different versions of a required iPhone app on different devices and the methods of attaching files was not consistent.) Hit me up if anyone's interested in extracting attachments from EML files.
While researching alternative solutions, we came across Forward Email. They offer a free tier that supports unlimited domains and email forwarding with webhook support. Webhook? Wha? Really? AMAZING!
When configuring a domain on the free tier for a webhook, you're required to add a special TXT "forward-email" DNS record in order to configure the endpoint. They have an option to encrypt the value so that it's not exposed to third-parties. If you want to configure it using their service (without the need to add it to DNS), you'll need a $3/mo "Enhanced" plan that also unlocks developer API access (to manage domains & aliases.)
After configuring this service, we opted to set up a Taffy API endpoint to accept emails-as-JSON and save them to the local file system. Based on our experience working with SendGrid webhooks, we save the JSON payload directly to the local file system without being dependent on a database connection. This approach has been beneficial as a client recently encountered database issues and it had zero negative impact on the API webhook's ability to store incoming data.
To access to the source code for the Taffy API endpoint, check out the post on the new MyCFML website.]]></summary>

Specifically, you might run into the MySQL error "Error Number: 1054 - Unknown column 'name' in 'where clause'" when you attempt to match a column that you've created in the SELECT clause. This error can be confusing because it seems logical to use an alias created in the SELECT statement in the WHERE clause.
Understanding the MySQL Error 1054
The reason for this error is straightforward: the MySQL query engine processes the WHERE clause before the SELECT clause. Therefore, any aliases created via CONCAT() in the SELECT statement cannot be directly referenced in the WHERE clause. In your case, you're attempting to filter results based on an alias 'name' …]]></summary>

APIs aren’t “add-ons” anymore. They’re the heart of every modern app. Whether it’s user data, product info, analytics, or payments, the frontend has become the API consumer. And as devs, we’re stuck wiring it all together—again and again.

That’s when I found Bellini. A visual frontend builder that actually treats APIs as first-class citizens. No fake integrations. No brittle magic. Just a low-code tool that respects the complexity of real apps and gives devs room to work.

In this article, we’ll break down how error unions work, when to use them, and how they make your code safer and clearer.
An error union is a value that may either be a result or an error. Think of it like Result in Rust, but built into the language.
The syntax:
fn doThing() !i32 {
    return 42; // could also return an error
}

This means doThing might return an i32, or an error.
Zig makes handling errors explicit — no hidden try/catch. You deal with them directly.
try


const result = try doThing();
std.debug.print("Value: {}\n", .{result});

If doThing() succeeds, result holds the value.
If it fails, the error is returned up the call stack.

In this guide, we’ll walk through building a fixed-size memory pool in Zig — ideal for managing short-lived or repeated allocations without relying on the heap each time.
A memory pool is a block of pre-allocated memory that you carve up manually. It's great for:
🚀 Performance-critical systems
🔁 Repeated short-lived allocations
💡 Avoiding fragmentation in embedded or constrained environments
Here’s a simple fixed-size pool for allocating structs:

Unlike languages that implicitly manage memory (like Go or Rust), Zig puts you in charge. Instead of relying on malloc or global state, allocators in Zig are passed explicitly, making dependencies clear and deterministic.

👉 https://nextjs.org/learn
Depois de resolver um problema chato com o bcrypt, avancei mais um pouco e decidi criar uma rota chamada /seed.
Tudo certo… até tentar rodar o app novamente.
E aí surgiu este erro:
[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/my-user/ws-nextjs-dashboard/.next/static/development/_buildManifest.js.tmp.qym5xk030le']

A mensagem parece clara: o arquivo _buildManifest.js.tmp não existe.

Mas o que isso quer dizer na prática?
Esse arquivo .tmp é gerado automaticamente durante o processo de build. Ele é temporário, e o Next espera encontrá-lo para continuar a coleta e organização dos assets da aplicação.
Quando esse arquivo falta ou é corrompido, o build trava — e o erro aparece.
No meu caso, foi uma combinação de fatores:
A execução da rota /seed durante o build causou efeitos colaterais inesperados.
Alguma falha durante uma build anterior corrompeu os arquivos temporários.
O Next.js tentou acessar arquivos que ainda não haviam sido completamente gerados.
Removi a pasta .next inteira (build anterior):




rm -rf .next

Evitei executar rotas como /seed diretamente no navegador durante o build.


Rebuldei e Reiniciei o servidor de desenvolvimento:




pnpm run build && pnpm run dev

Se você vir esse tipo de erro (ENOENT em arquivos .tmp), desconfie de:
builds interrompidos,
execuções paralelas do dev e build,
código sendo executado no build que deveria rodar só no runtime real.
Já passou por esse tipo de dor de cabeça com Next.js?
Esses perrengues são bons para reforçar aprendizados — e compartilhar pode ajudar outros também]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A crypto-skeptical commissioner at the US Securities and Exchange Commission has blasted her agency over its settlement letter that could finally end the Ripple legal saga. 
The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump  administration’s tariffs.

This article addresses a common challenge: rotating a horizontal image 90 degrees to make it vertical and then ensuring it floats correctly within your text. We will explore the CSS techniques required for this task and demonstrate how to effectively implement it.
Understanding Image Rotation and Floating in CSS
It’s quite straightforward to rotate an image using CSS. By applying the transform: rotate(90deg); property to your image, you can change its orientation. However, when you apply rotation, you may notice that floating the image using float: right; doesn’t behave as expected on mobile devices. This can lead to further complications, e…]]></summary>

The big problem? CONTEXT SWITCHING.
Here's what studies say about context switching:
According to the American Psychological Association, switching tasks can cost up to 40% of your productive time.
A study by Gloria Mark, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, found that it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to regain focus after an interruption.
According to psychologist Gerald Weinberg, each extra task you switch between eats up 20–80% of your productivity:
For agile teams, this means:
So, how can you fix this?
Set up 'no interruption' time blocks in your team's schedule.
Prioritize tasks ruthlessly.
Try the Pomodoro Technique.
Get better at async communication.

Artificial intelligence, capable of replicating the unique timbres and resonant qualities of human speech, promises innovation—but brings with it profound ethical challenges. Where voice actors once saw stable creative livelihoods, they now confront serious questions about consent, identity, ownership, and even the meaning of artistic integrity itself.
Together, let’s step carefully into this nuanced landscape—where the human voice and machine capability meet, mix, and inevitably conflict.
For voice performers, their instrument isn’t merely technical or professional. It's deeply personal: a distinctive signature inseparable from their identity. Unlike written words or musical notes, a voice embodies a person's emo…]]></summary>

In modern Python development, managing dependencies efficiently is crucial. If you're using the uv tool for dependency management, you might encounter a situation where you want to keep your Git-based dependencies up to date whenever changes are made in the repository. This article will help you figure out how to configure uv to automatically perform a git pull for your dependencies, ensuring your virtual environment reflects the latest code.
Understanding the Issue
The problem arises when you add a Git repository as a dependency in your project using the uv add command. After making commits in the Git repository of the dependency, you might expect that running uv sync will pull the changes and update the files in your current virtual environment (usually located in .venv).

Like many in the game dev scene, I found myself constantly switching between Trello for tasks, Notion for docs, Google Drive for assets, Discord for team chat, and itch.io for visibility. It worked, sort of. But it was messy and inefficient.
So I started building Jolyo, a platform that brings all these essentials together in one place, with game creators in mind.

Git isn’t just a version control system—it’s a content-addressable key-value store with an elegant and powerful object model. Understanding this model enables advanced usage, more efficient workflows, and better debugging.
Git stores everything in its .git/objects/ directory using SHA-1 hashes as keys and compressed content as values.
echo "Hello Git" | git hash-object -w --stdin

This command stores a blob (file content) and returns its SHA-1 hash.
Git’s internal model revolves around four object types:

Stores raw file content (not filename).

However, one of their bigger downsides is the lack of accurate parse error reporting. Let's take a look. Suppose you want to parse records of this format: 1 Bob ie an ID number followed by one or more spaces, followed by an alphabetic word (a name). Here's a basic Angstrom parser for this:
open Angstrom

type person = { id : int; name : string; }

let sp = skip_many1 (char ' ')
let word = take_while1 (function 'A' .. 'Z' |'a'..'z' -> true | _ -> false)
let num = take_while1 (function '0'..'9' -> true | _ -> false)

Instead of loading all elements of a page on initial load, lazy loading allows the browser to only load elements that are visible to the user, saving bandwidth and speeding up page load times.
As users increasingly rely on mobile devices and sometimes slower internet connections, site performance becomes crucial for user experience. One of the easiest ways to improve performance is by using lazy loading for images or other elements that are not immediately visible on the page.
One way to implement lazy loading is by using the Intersection Observer API, which provides an efficient way to detect when elements come into the user's viewport.

When most developers think of Git, version control comes to mind. But beneath its porcelain surface lies a powerful, content-addressable file system designed with immutability, integrity, and efficiency in mind. This post peels back the layers to explore Git as a content management system, powered by cryptographic hashing and a robust object model.
At the core of Git is content-addressability—a paradigm where content is identified and retrieved using a SHA-1 hash, not a filename.
“If two pieces of content are the same, Git ensures they are stored once—immutably and efficiently.”
This design guarantees:
Uniqueness: Identical content results in identical hashes.
Integrity: Any mutation alters the hash and creates a new object.

One common use case is the contenteditable attribute, which allows users to edit text directly in a block element. In this article, we'll address a specific challenge: how to change the color of certain characters while still allowing users to type freely in a contenteditable div.
Understanding the Problem
The issue arises from the way you are manipulating the inner HTML of the contenteditable div. When you use innerHTML to replace characters with styled <span> elements, it effectively refreshes the entire content of the div, causing the cursor position to reset and leading to a frustrating user experience. This can also prevent users from typing, as they may lose their current input context.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of databases, ensuring data integrity and consistency is paramount. This is where ACID principles come into play. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, and these principles are foundational to any SQL database operation. Let's explore each principle and provide examples to illustrate how they work in practice.
What Are the ACID Principles?
Atomicity
Atomicity ensures that a series of database operations either fully complete or do not happen at all. This means that if one operation in the transaction fails, all previous operations are rolled back to maintain the state before the transaction began.
For example, consider a banking application where we need to transfer funds from one account to another. Both deduction from the sender's account and add…]]></summary>

In this article, we explore why the operator+= in C++ can accept brace-enclosed initializer lists while operator+ cannot. Understanding this issue is crucial for C++ developers, especially when dealing with operator overloading in modern C++.
The Issue Explained
When working with C++11 and later, initializer lists are a powerful feature that allows for more natural syntax when initializing collections. However, when you try to use these lists with overloaded operators, things don't always go as expected.
The code snippet shared shows two operator overloads defined for a struct AddInitializerList: one for operator+= and another for operator+.

Short covering above $105,000 could trigger a Bitcoin price rally to new highs.

Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $101,000 on May 8, reaching its highest level in over three months. The 4.6% daily BTC price gain triggered $205 million in liquidations of bearish futures positions and eroded the value of nearly every put (sell) option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I took over a project for a client recently, I discovered they were spending nearly $1,000 monthly on AWS infrastructure despite having fewer than 5 active users. This is how I fixed it.
The Problem
Poorly designed Flask backend
Everything running in development mode on expensive AWS EC2 instances
A client who had just laid off their team and needed an MVP launched
The Solution
Purchased two high-performance dedicated servers from Hetzner
Self-hosted Coolify as a Platform-as-a-Service solution
Containerized all application components
Implemented CICD with Github for streamlined deployments.
Migrated everything away from AWS
For those unfamiliar, Coolify is an open-source alternative to Netlify or Heroku that can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure.
The Results
80% reduction in monthly infrastructure costs (from ~$1,000 to ~$<200)
More stable environment with proper containerization
Simplified deployment process
Full control without vendor lock-in
Key Takeaway
Before automatically choosing the most popular cloud provider, consider alternatives like Hetzner combined with self-hosted PaaS solutions like Coolify. For many early-stage startups, this approach provides the right balance of developer experience and cost-efficiency.
Sometimes the best technical solution isn't the most expensive one.
Upcoming
Self-host Coolify on your own infrastructure
Host your own services like analytics, project management tools, interactive forms like Formspree, and much more.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
If you're developing a Flutter application, you may encounter the ProviderNotFoundException error, as described in the sample you provided. This error indicates that the BuildContext used does not have access to the Provider you're trying to access, which can be particularly tricky when managing state across multiple screens or routes in your Flutter app.
Understanding the ProviderNotFoundException
The ProviderNotFoundException occurs when a widget tries to read a provider that hasn't been set up in its ancestor widget tree. This commonly happens in several scenarios:
Hot Reload Issues: After adding a new provider, if you perform a hot reload instead of a hot restart, the application state may not fully recognize the new provider.
Incorrect Widget Hierarchy: If your provider i…]]></summary>

I started my journey into the world of crypto with a lot of doubts. I thought:
"If anything, I’d invest in ETH, not Bitcoin."
But even then, I was concerned about the environmental impact.
Reading more, I discovered that Ethereum had transitioned to a more sustainable consensus mechanism — Proof of Stake (PoS) — unlike Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW). That helped ease my conscience a bit.
But that was just the first hurdle.
I set up my wallet and opened an account on a crypto exchange. That part was fairly smooth — I'm a software engineer, so I know my way around tech.
Still, I found myself uneasy about usability and safety. Crypto addresses are long, unreadable strings, and one wrong character could mean losing your funds fo…]]></summary>

If you're writing a simple text editor in C and encountering issues with your text disappearing when using the Backspace key at the beginning of a line, you're not alone. Many newcomers face unexpected behavior in their text manipulation functions. This article will dive into why this happens, particularly focusing on how Backspace interacts with your cursor position and text storage.
Understanding the Issue
In your C text editor code, when you press the Backspace key (ASCII 8), you're performing different operations depending on the cursor's current position. If the cursor is at the beginning of a line (cursor_x = 0), the function tries to merge the current line with the preceding line using strcat. Though this is an intended feature, it inadvertently leads to the upper line …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you know you can create dynamic routes in Next.js with just four lines of code?
As a freelancer working on front-end projects to pay the bills (thanks, American healthcare system), I recently discovered how to create dynamic routes in Next.js without any extra complications.
The Problem
I was tasked with creating a list of dashboards for Annual Performance Reviews (APR). Each APR has a unique name, and each one needs its own route, like: 
http://localhost:3000/apr/[ReviewType]
With a large dataset containing various types of APRs, manually creating each route by making individual folders inside the app directory wasn’t feasible:
-- app


Manually replacing review[index].type with the actual review types from my data would be tedious and inefficient.
The Solution
I simplified the structure by creating a single folder: 
-- app


Using square brackets in a folder name creates what Next.js calls a Dynamic Segment. With a Dynamic Segment, you can access all the parameters using the useRouter hook.
In my case, I didn’t need to use the hook because I already had the review types, and the slugs in the URL matched those types. The solution was straightforward: 
const reviewType = reviewsType.find((rt) => rt.slug === params.reviewType);
The {params} are the props in the page.jsx file of my Dynamic Route. If the reviewType from the URL matches the slug type, it’s a valid reviewType, and I can create the slug.
It’s that simple. Later, I'll call the Links with their href destination to generate the user’s click in the sidebar component: 
reviewsType.map((rt) => <Link href={/apr/${rt.slug}}> {rt.title} </Link>);
Conclusion
Next.js routing is incredibly powerful and easy to use. I’m excited to continue exploring all of Next.js’s capabilities and preparing a course for developers like me. If you’re proficient in web development but new to Next.js, join our community learning sessions. Live sessions and recordings will be available!

If enough requests arrive, even legitimate-looking ones, the backend will scale automatically and incur that cost — and the account owner will receive the bill.
This is not an exception. It is the intended behavior.

Several public cases illustrate how cloud billing can be exploited or spiral out of control:
  $100K in 24 hours via Firebase – A WebGL hosting app saw a sudden traffic spike and was billed over $100,000. The cloud service scaled perfectly. No failure occurred — other than financial.
  One public file in Firebase = $98K – A single shared file led to massive egress usage and a near six-figure bill.

The bill, sponsored by Senator Bill Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis and Angela Alsobrooks, received last-minute pushback from Democrats, who took aim at the bill and raised concerns about US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures.
To address the concerns of Senate Democrats, the bill had already been amended to include stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers for further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.
The GENIUS Act was seen as a bipartisan effort to increase regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States. The focus of the bill, stablecoins used for payments, was looked at as extending dollar dominance internationally and straying away from more controversial crypto topics.
After the procedure failed, Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats, saying, “Democrats have been accommodated every step of the way […] frankly, I just don’t get it.”

Choosing the right state management pattern can drastically impact maintainability, performance, and developer experience. Whether you're building a small dashboard or a sprawling enterprise SPA, this guide walks through modern and effective shared state management patterns in React.
Before introducing tools like Redux or Zustand, ask:
Is this state needed by many components?
Does it need to persist across navigation?
Should it be cached, memoized, or reactive?
If the answer is no, local state via useState or useReducer is usually enough:
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

Premature global state can overcomplicate things.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
When working with data in Python, especially using the Pandas library, you often need to filter DataFrames based on specific conditions—like dates in your case. However, dynamically generating filter conditions can sometimes be tricky. If you've noticed that your dynamically created filter condition is yielding an empty DataFrame, don’t worry; you’re not alone in this struggle. Let's break down your issue and solve it step by step!
Understanding the Dynamic Filtering Issue
The issue arises from logical operations in your loop. When you create a filter condition dynamically, you must ensure that the logical operators are applied correctly. In your case, using & for element-wise AND operation is correct; however, the parentheses and precedence in evaluating the filter might be c…]]></summary>

Last week I released v1.14 of Rails Designer's UI Components. With that release came a fully-customizable Calendar Component, built with ViewComponent and designed with Tailwind CSS.
Since that release I got two times the question via email about recurring events. Does that work? And indeed it does. The Calendar Component simply accepts an events array/collection. And while this kind of functionality is out-of-scope of a UI component (and the support for it), I am currently working on something that just happens to need this kind of feature. It is not at all too difficult to start (the tricky bits start when hundreds of thousands of events are created 😬). So what else can I do then to share how I would approach this in an article?

What starts as a couple of Vue components can easily evolve into a hundred interconnected files, each with their own state logic, side effects, and styling concerns. To prevent tech debt and burnout, let’s talk about how to design Vue.js projects for maintainability.
A well-organized src/ directory can make or break a large Vue application. The common pitfall is stuffing everything into a components/ folder. Instead, group files by domain or feature:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Layer 2s have been a great blockchain success story. They’ve reduced congestion on the Ethereum mainnet, driving down gas fees while preserving security.
But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees. 
“People in the Ethereum Foundation [the nonprofit that supports the Ethereum ecosystem] will tell you that, ‘Yes, we effed up by being too ivory tower.’ I have heard that multiple times,” said David Hoffman, an owner at Bankless, during a panel discussion at the …]]></summary>

Six months ago, I was lazy, unfocused, and overwhelmed.
I’d scroll mindlessly on my phone, work beyond healthy hours, skip workouts, and constantly put off things I knew were good for me. I didn’t need a fancy productivity system — I needed a push. Something simple. Visual. Relentless.
That’s when I built Days Without – Habit Tracker.
I wasn’t aiming to reinvent productivity apps. I built Days Without for myself — because I genuinely needed help. I was tired of breaking promises to myself like “I’ll start tomorrow” or “just 10 more minutes on Instagram.”
I needed a streak counter. A clear, visual reminder of how long I’ve stuck to something. Something lightweight and shame-free, but still motivating.
With Days Without, I start…]]></summary>

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that evolved from Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike traditional development approaches that focus on implementation details, BDD focuses on the behavior of the system from the user’s perspective.
BDD encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders through a shared language that everyone can understand. This approach bridges the gap between technical and business teams by using natural language descriptions of requirements that can also serve as tests.

According to attorney Aaron Brogan, the bill stipulates a 100% income tax deduction for any capital gains income because the Missouri tax code does not explicitly distinguish between capital gains and income tax.

This specific issue seems to arise post-update to One UI 7.0 and Android 15, leaving many users wondering why their app layout is affected, especially if it was functioning well before the update.
Understanding the Problem
The main cause of this issue appears to be related to how the new system UI interacts with Flutter’s rendering mechanism. With the update to One UI 7.0, some changes might have impacted how safe areas and overlays are managed. The SafeArea widget is designed to prevent UI elements from overlapping with system UI elements such as the status bar and navigation bar. Howeve…]]></summary>

This project tries to make technology accessible to many more people. Today, a lot of developers are good in programming & technology but not many are proficient in English. This becomes a barrier for them to use technology.
Using Amazon Q Developer, I have demonstrated a simple use of Amazon Q to generate documentation in regional languages like Hindi.
Having documentation in familiar, non-English, local languages will make technology accessible to many more people, thus becoming more inclusive. Adoption of Amazon Q will also increase.

https://github.com/msr2610/neometroapi
Here is how I used Amazon Q Developer:
Open new chat in Amazon Q Developer
Give a new "/dev" command and provide following prompt:
a) From Java code file (Neocontroller.java), pick up all routes
After this, Amazon Q Developer correctly generates a markdown file with description for each route in Hindi. 
Paste this file in a Docusaurus project and you have documentation of API (or your application screens) in non-English, regional language !

Since then, I’ve been applying to jobs, following leads, and doing what I can to stay afloat, even diving deeper into Rust, building side projects like daemons and SDKs to keep growing. But there’s one thing I kept thinking about, a project I’ve poured months of love into: Potatoe Squeezy.

See how to define physical tools or specific items in your system with serial numbers. You can also link tools to Business Central records like fixed assets, items, or resources, and even mark some tools as “required” so inspectors must enter a serial number during testing.
Learn how to assign physical tools to individual test steps within your inspection templates. This session shows how to open a checklist, pick a test, and select the tools for that specific measurement. Required tools get flagged if left blank, so nothing gets missed during the inspection process.
See how users can mark tools as used, enter serial numbers (especially for required tools), and get visual feedback—like red highlights when a tool ID is missing, helping maintain traceability and compliance.

If you're diving into JavaScript, you've probably come across array methods like slice() and splice() and thought... "Wait, what’s the difference?" You’re not alone! These two often confuse beginners — and even experienced devs sometimes need a refresher.
In this article, we’ll break down slice(), splice(), and some other important array methods like push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() in JavaScript. Let’s spice things up and get slicing!
slice() – Non-destructive Copy


Purpose: Extract a portion of an array without modifying the original.
Syntax:
array.slice(start, end);

start: The index where the extraction begins.
end (optional): The index where extraction ends (not included).
Example:
const fruits = ['🍎', '🍌', '🍓', '🍇'…]]></summary>

It's 3 AM. Your phone buzzes aggressively with an alert notification:
DatasourceNoData | 𝗙𝗜𝗥𝗜𝗡𝗚
Half-asleep, you grab your laptop, VPN into your infrastructure, and... everything's fine. No pods are crashing, no services are down, and CPU/memory usage across the cluster is normal. You've just been woken up by a false alert caused by a temporary blip in your monitoring system.
If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. Many Kubernetes operators and SREs face this exact challenge: how do you create robust monitoring alerts that catch real issues but don't wake you up for temporary glitches?

در این مثال، اگر عرض صفحه نمایش کمتر از 768 پیکسل باشه، رنگ پس زمینه و حاشیه های کلاس "container" تغییر می کنن. این قابلیت به طراح ها کمک می کنه تا تجربه کاربری بهتری رو فراهم کنن و مطمئن بشن که وب سایت در هر دستگاهی به خوبی نمایش داده می شه.

Has been way to long since I created a hobby/side project, so I decided to create a simple web app for tracking points in the board game Kill Team from Games Workshop. It's called Kill Team Sidekick.
It's a SPA PWA built in Svelte and TypeScript. It's compiled statically now but can be changed to have a back end, should I need it for future features. First time building in Svelte and I'm pleasantly surprised. Uses a Material UI as a base for the design. Hosted on AWS.
If you have any suggestions, comments or feedback then please share. I'm always open to hear what others think.
Very happy with the results. I'm in love with PWA's and, unpopular opinion, I (still) think it's the future of smart phone apps.]]></summary>

One common requirement is the need to specify default template parameters when using template templates. If you have a function that utilizes a template template parameter, you may want to provide default types for those parameters, particularly when dealing with standard containers like std::unordered_map.
Understanding Template Template Parameters
Before we dive into the solution, let’s clarify what template template parameters are. A template template parameter is a template that takes other templates as parameters. For example, when you declare template <template <typename K, typename V> typename Map>, you are saying that Map itself is a template that accepts two type pa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky will probably be allowed to travel for his daughter’s wedding regardless of the outcome of his May 8 sentencing hearing.
In a May 8 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl approved an application for Mashinsky to travel from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, between May 26 and May 29 for his daughter’s wedding. The approval was available on the public docket on May 8, but later appeared to have been removed.
Judge Koeltl will determine in a May 8 hearing whether Mashinsky serves prison time following a plea deal with prosecutors.
The former Celsius CEO appeared ready to go to trial in 2024 until his lawyers lost a motion to have his charges dismissed. He pleaded guilty to commodities fraud and a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the price of the platform’s native token, CEL.
Mashinsky has been free on a $40-million bond since July 2023, with travel outside certain areas requiring court approval, such as the roughly 900-mile (1,500-kilometer) distance between New York and Memphis. As of May 8, it’s unclear if he will be expected to surrender to authorities.

But when the goal is to find the maximum sum of any path, including those that may start and end at any node, we need a careful approach to handle different types of path combinations.
The main idea is to use depth-first search (DFS) and, at each node, calculate:
The best path that can be used to extend to the parent (choose either left or right subtree).
The best complete path that can split at the current node (includes both left and right subtrees).
We track a global variable res to store the maximum sum seen so far.
Here’s the breakdown:
For each node, recursively calculate the maximum sum path from the left and right subtrees.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: A Drexel University study dug into data from Portland, Oregon—tracking over 36,000 trees planted between 1990–2020—and found that mothers living within 100 meters of newly planted trees tend to have heavier, healthier babies. After controlling for factors like income, education and BMI, researchers saw each new tree bump birthweight by about 2.3 grams; hanging out near ten or more trees equated to a roughly 50-gram gain, plus lower risks of pre-term and small-for-gestational-age births.
What’s cool is that this goes beyond just big old parks: even new saplings make a difference, hinting that planting trees is a simple, low-cost public-health win. Established trees also helped buffer road-density effects (think less noise and pollution), and the team thinks part of the benefit comes from the stress-busting “soft fascination” of green surroundings. The authors call for randomized trials, but treating tree-planting as a natural experiment already makes a strong case that more greenery = healthier starts to life.]]></summary>

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is a key aspect of programming that facilitates communication between different processes. One common method for IPC is using message queues, which allow processes to send and receive messages in a structured way. However, as you dive into IPC programming, you may encounter errors such as msgget() returning No such file or directory. In this article, we will explore why this error occurs and how to resolve it.
What Causes the Error?
Before we delve into the solution, it’s crucial to understand the source of the error. The function ftok() is used to generate a unique key for the message queue based on a pathname and a project identifier. If the pathname provided to ftok() does not exist, or the process does…]]></summary>

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

This leads us to the discussion of Tail Call Optimization (TCO). This optimization allows a function to call another function, or itself, without requiring a new stack frame, effectively reducing overhead and memory usage. While many functional languages utilize TCO to enhance performance, it raises an important question: does Ruby implement tail call optimization?
Understanding Tail Call Optimization (TCO)
TCO is key in functional programming for several reasons. When a function calls another or itself as its last action, traditional languages allocate a new stack frame for each call, which can lead to stack overflow or excessive memory use. TCO allows the programming language to reuse …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I'm super excited to share a small but satisfying project I completed today: a Google homepage clone built using only HTML and CSS. 🎉
🚀 Why I Did This
As someone who's on a journey to become a better front-end developer, I thought recreating iconic websites would be a great way to practice. And what better place to start than with one of the cleanest and most minimalist designs on the internet—Google’s homepage! 🔍✨
🛠️ What I Used
HTML for the structure 🧱
CSS for styling and layout 🎨
No JavaScript this time (keeping it simple!) ⚙️
🎯 Key Features
Centered Google logo 🖼️
Search input box with shadow 🔳
Two classic buttons: "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" 🎲
Responsive design for smaller screens 📱
Clean and minimal layout, just like the real deal ✅
How to use Flexbox to center elements perfectly
Creating a minimalistic UI with clean CSS
The power of spacing and alignment in good design
Small touches like hover effects and shadows really enhance the UI ✨
📌 What’s Next?
I plan to continue this mini-series by cloning other popular websites to sharpen my front-end skills. Maybe next up: Netflix or Instagram Login Page? Stay tuned! 📺📸
Thanks for reading! Let me know your thoughts or if you've tried something like this. Would love to connect and grow with the dev community. 💬❤️]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tinybird just announced Explorations, a new conversational UI feature in Tinybird to explore and interact with your data using natural language. Instead of writing complex SQL queries or manually building dashboards, you just ask questions of your data and get answers.
You type simple, natural-language questions directly into the interface.
It translates your questions into contextualized SQL queries automatically.
The result is displayed visually as tables and charts.





  
  
  Why is it useful?


Data is often large, messy, and unstructured. You have to spend a lot of time studying the schema or SELECT * … LIMIT 1 to figure out its shape. Then you have to constantly check the SQL reference and iterate your queries to get things right. When data is complex, this is a huge time drain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 increased its hashrate by 79% during the first quarter of the year.
According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US by trading volume, has agreed to acquire Deribit, one of the world’s biggest crypto derivatives trading platforms.
Coinbase Global will acquire Deribit for about $2.9 billion, the exchange announced on May 8.
The acquisition will allow Coinbase to expand into the profitable crypto derivatives market and continue scaling the platform’s global growth, Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s vice president of institutional product, said in the announcement.
“With Deribit’s strong presence and professional client base, Coinbase is making its most substantial move yet to accelerate our international growth strategy,” he said.
Source: Coinbase
Deal follows reports of Dubai regulatory steps
The $2.9 billion deal includes $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase Class A common stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.
“This transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by year-end,” the announcement said.
Previous reports in March suggested that Coinbase and Deribit had alerted regulators in Dubai about the potential deal, as Deribit holds a license in Dubai, which would need to be transferred to Coinbase if the deal is successful.
The reports also previously suggested that a deal with Coinbase could value Deribit at between $4 billion and $5 billion.
Cointelegraph approached Deribit for comment regarding the deal but did not receive a response by the time of publication.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) might've been cool in 2010. But today, it feels like managing a modern Mac environment with a rotary phone. No logging, no alerts, clunky performance, and good luck if your team’s outside your local network.
I hit a breaking point as a DevOps engineer supporting hybrid teams using Macs for testing and builds. I needed real-time access, reliable performance, and automation hooks. So I did what most of us do when we’re fed up—I built a workaround, failed at it, and then finally found a smarter way.
ARD is stuck in the past. It assumes you're on the same network. It’s slow over VPN, doesn’t scale, and worst of all—it asks for manual approvals and fails silently when permissions aren’t set right.
I tried workarounds:

Specifically, we will explore how to properly invoke a Flow from a use case class without requiring .invoke(), ensuring that we can seamlessly handle streaming data.
Understanding the Flow in Kotlin
Flows are a powerful component of Kotlin's Coroutines that allow you to work with asynchronous data streams. They are cold, meaning they don't start emitting values until they are collected. Therefore, it's essential to understand how to properly invoke and collect from these Flows in your ViewModel.
Your Use Case and ViewModel Code

After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…]]></summary>

For years, I’ve seen students from small towns like mine—Bihar—struggle to find organized, reliable study material for Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), especially for Class 12th. Whether it's past year papers, chapter-wise tests, proper notes, or even just motivation—resources are scattered, outdated, or behind a paywall.
That’s why I decided to do something about it.
I’m building a free, open-source platform where students can find:

for loop, something felt... heavy.
squares = []
for _ in range(10):
    squares.append(_ * _)

Wait... I wasn’t even using the variable for anything besides its own value.
👀 The Realization
squares = [ _ * _ for _ in range(10) ]

That’s it? That’s legal?
.append(). No unnecessary scaffolding.
✅ Cleaner
🧐 Why it works:
Want to filter as well?
evens = [ _ for _ in range(20) if _ % 2 == 0 ]

Compare that to the old-fashioned way, and it’s no contest.
🚫 Never Again...
for loops for simple list building.

And so do the languages, with which programmers express their intentions to a computer. But it is my impression, that the development in this space becomes more and more like searching for a local minimum, in a space constrained by previously adopted abstractions, and the limitations that come from them. There is nothing wrong with that, but what interests me is - can we have revolutionary progress, instead of evolutionary? If it is possible, it would take questioning the assumptions made until this point, challenging our very viewpoint. So, let us engage in some critical thinking.

🎙️ I recently attended a really eye-opening talk called “Meta Concerns in ML Security and Privacy” by a professor from the University of Waterloo. It wasn’t your usual technical deep dive—it focused more on the big picture of how we can keep machine learning (ML) systems safe in the long run.
🌟 Why This Talk Was So Interesting
What really stuck with me was this:
🔑 What I Learned
🤖It’s tricky to prove who actually “owns” a trained model. Techniques like watermarking (hiding info inside the model) or fingerprinting (adding unique traits) might help, but they’re not perfect and can be hard to verify.
👀 Different Attackers = Different Problems
⚠️ Too Many Defenses Can Backfire
🧩 No One-Size-Fits-All Fix
🛠️ Amulet Toolkit
💭 My Final Thoughts
If you’re working on anything with AI or ML, I’ll leave you with this question:
“Are we solving the right problems—or just the easy ones?” 🤔
Real security isn’t about reacting to problems—it’s about being ready before they even happen. 🧠👣🚀]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Choosing the right virtual platforms for meetings is no longer just an operational decision—it’s a strategic one. The tools you select can either empower your team or lead to disengagement, inefficiency, and missed opportunities. As companies continue to refine their digital collaboration strategies, understanding what makes or breaks these platforms is essential—especially when it comes to high-impact formats like the 1 on 1 meeting agenda.
The Rise of Virtual Meeting Platforms in a Remote-First World
Must-Have Features That Drive Effective Virtual Collaboration
1. Reliable Audio and Video Quality
2. Integrated Agenda and Note-Taking Tools
3. Scheduling Automation and Time Zone Management
4. Breakout Rooms and Small Group Features
5. Security and Privacy Controls
The Human Element: **Why 1-on-1 Meetings Matter More Than Ever

As the work-from-anywhere trend continues, several innovations are shaping the next generation of meeting platforms:
AI-Powered Meeting Summaries: Tools like Otter.ai and Fireflies use AI to transcribe meetings and highlight key decisions or action items—ideal for leaders managing multiple direct reports.
Mood and Engagement Trackers: Newer platforms are experimenting with passive feedback tools, like mood indicators and micro-pulse surveys during meetings, to help managers better read the virtual room.
Asynchronous Video and Audio: Not every conversation needs to be live. Apps like Loom and Claap allow users to share quick video updates, freeing up calendars and reducing meeting fatigue.
Customization for Culture Fit: From branded meeting rooms to icebreaker prompts and shared playlists, platforms are focusing on building human connection in the virtual space.
Final Thoughts
1 on 1 meeting agenda, backed by a reliable and intuitive platform, empowers managers to build stronger relationships, drive performance, and retain top talent. In a world where face-to-face interactions are rare, your meeting platform is your culture—make sure it works for you, not against you.]]></summary>

This article will provide insights into why these problems occur and share effective solutions to ensure your images display correctly across all devices.
Why Do Images Lose Quality on Mobile?
Many developers face issues where images look fine on desktop but appear stretched or pixelated on mobile devices. This typically results from how browsers interpret image resolution in relation to device screens. Here are some common reasons:
Fixed Dimensions: Setting fixed dimensions for images in your HTML or CSS might work well on larger screens but could distort the images on smaller screens due to scaling.
Viewport Settings: If your viewpo…]]></summary>

You start out super motivated, binge tutorials, build your first button... and then a few days (or weeks) in, you're exhausted. The passion fades. Everything feels overwhelming. And suddenly, Netflix is looking real tempting.
Yeah, I’ve been there.
The good news? It doesn’t have to be that way. You can stay consistent, make real progress, and still have a life — no burnout required. Here's how I manage to keep going (and actually enjoy it) on my own coding journey.
Keep Your Goals Simple and Honest


Don’t try to conquer JavaScript, React, and Next.js all in one week. That’s the fastest way to crash.
Instead, break things down:
Today: Learn how querySelector works
Tomorrow: Try building a mini calculator

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently reflecting on the long-term path I want to take as a developer and would love to hear some real opinions.
Between JavaScript and Java, which one do you think is more worth specializing in, and why?
I'm thinking both in terms of career opportunities and what the job market actually demands — both here in Morocco and internationally. I know each has its own ecosystem and strengths, but I'm curious about which one you believe is more future-proof or in demand right now.
If you've worked with one or both, or have insights from your experience or your region, I’d really appreciate your input.

With GPT-4o, more cognitively shallow tasks are becoming candidates for automation.

In particular, repetitive coding patterns — where inputs and rules are well-defined — can be partially handled by LLMs.
Code generation isn't fully autonomous yet.

But when interfaces and data specs are clearly described, it becomes possible to automate part of the implementation and testing process using structured prompts.
This doesn’t eliminate the need for human judgment.

But even if only a predictable subset of code( about 50% of code ) can be automated, the potential productivity gain is worth exploring.
JavaFactory is an IntelliJ plugin built to test this idea.

Engraving custom text on a 3D model is an intriguing task for many Blender users, especially when dealing with curved surfaces like eyeglass temples. In this article, we will explore how to ensure your custom text (like a name) gets engraved cleanly and efficiently on a curved STL mesh. We'll also troubleshoot the common issues you may face, including unsightly artifacts, improper engraving, and modification difficulties.
Understanding the Problem
When you're trying to engrave text on a curved surface, multiple factors can affect the final outcome. In your case, the goal is to replace an existing embossed watermark on an eyeglass temple mesh with your own custom text. When we use Boolean operations to achieve this, we primarily encounter issues related to the geometry of the c…]]></summary>

Each environment needs a setup to run JS code and convert it to machine instructions. This setup is the JavaScript Runtime Environment. Here, we’ll explore what it is and its core components, preparing for a deeper look at JS execution in future articles.
A runtime environment is the system that lets JavaScript code run and interact with its platform. It centers on a JavaScript engine, which parses, compiles, and executes code, turning JS into bytecode or machine code, often via Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation (more on that later!). But the engine isn’t enough. JS is single-threaded, handling one task at a time.…]]></summary>

The traditional inference model, pioneered by companies like OpenAI, revolves around providers offering one or a few large language models (LLMs) with 100% uptime and swift responses. This approach simplifies GPU management since all users share the same LLM, ensuring even load distribution.
However, this convenience comes at a cost:
Users are typically charged based on arbitrary, non-transparent metrics like token count.
The selection of LLMs is sparse, they are usually censored and your data is being trained on. 😕
An alternative is the serverless model, where you rent a GPU instance and install any LLM you want with specialization and features tailored to your needs. This approach offers:

In this article, we’ll explore how to create such a layout that also fills the entire viewport height, minus the header, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Understanding the Layout Needs
When creating a web layout, a common issue developers face is how to effectively use CSS for responsive designs. Specifically, for your layout, you want:
A fixed-width navigation pane (100px wide).
A fluid body that occupies the remaining space.
Both sections to fill the full viewport height, excluding the header.

With Laravel 12, the syntax for defining accessors and mutators has been updated to make it more concise and intuitive.
In this article, we’ll explore how to format dates using accessors and mutators with the new syntax introduced in Laravel 12.
Accessors: Modify how an attribute is retrieved from the database.


Mutators: Modify how an attribute is stored in the database.
For example, you can use an accessor to format a date when retrieving it and a mutator to ensure the date is stored in a specific format.

Try to guess what will be printed to console.
Answer

Some explanation:
Parent is parsed and rendered, without useEffect,
Child, when there is no more nested components is turn of async hooks
useEffect from children to parents.

But the size of the infrastructure grew and this approach couldn't scale. Chef and Puppet popularized the idea of Infrastructure-as-Code: engineers would define the state of the machine(s) in text files, stored in Git–hence the name. A global node would read these files to create a registry. Then, a local agent on each machine would check the desired state at regular intervals, and reconcile the current state with the registry.
The first generation of IaC managed the state of existing machines but assumed the machine was already there. The migration to the Cloud created another issue: how do you create the machine in the first place? Another IaC tool appeared in the fo…]]></summary>

Scalability is a critical factor in modern web development. As applications grow, they must handle increasing traffic, data, and user demands without compromising performance. Node.js, with its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, is an excellent choice for building scalable applications. In this guide, we'll explore best practices for scaling Node.js applications, covering architecture, performance optimization, and deployment strategies.
Why Node.js for Scalability?
Node.js is built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event loop to handle asynchronous operations efficiently. This makes it ideal for I/O-heavy applications like APIs, real-time services, and microservices. Key advantages include:

Account verification is used primarily to confirm that the information defining the account is accurate and represents a real person, company, or other organization. It’s an important step for combating fraud, especially with accounts that deal with any financial transactions. It’s also a helpful tool for removing bot and spam accounts, which can otherwise waste resources and introduce security vulnerabilities.
In many account verification systems, the process is something like this: a user inputs their information into a form, the system creates an unverified account based on that form, and then the account is verified - often with an automated email or SMS sent to the email address or number the user provided on sign-up.

The error we're handling today is a C++ compilation error:
error: use of deleted function X

In C++, the error occurs when you try to invoke a function that has been explicitly marked as deleted or implicitly deleted by the compiler. This error commonly arises in relation to special member functions such as constructors, copy constructors, assignment operators etc. Functions can be explicitly deleted by the programmer to prevent certain operations or they can be implicitly deleted when certain conditions make them invalid (e.g. if a class member is non-copyable).
Fixing depends on the situation in which the error occurred. Below you find some examples of such situations.
In C++ every function can be explicitly deleted, for example:

With help of AI, Manual testers will shift from normal validation tasks to identifying the edge cases and evaluating software from real world prespective.


There will be a growing synergy between manual testers and AI. Testers will contribute to training and refining AI models, ensuring they align with actual user needs.


AI will help manual testers to more efficient by offering insights through data analysis,  defect predication and test prioritization.


The manual tester key areas are exploratory testing where unexpected issues may come. UI and accessibility testing which requires manual testers to assess user-friendliness and domain specific testing where industry knowledge is critical.


Also the manual testers will need to upskill in areas like data analysis,AI collaboration and communications.

Compliance and Regulatory Requirements
Expiration of SSL certificates assists organizations in meeting the company's legal and other requirements, such as regulatory compliance and standards.

Boost the right gigs. Optimize my profile.
But over time, I realized something deeper was off, not just with the platform, but with the entire freelance ecosystem.
If you go to Upwork, at first, it looks like jobs are popping up all the time. Feels like opportunity, right?
But most of these jobs are low-paying, low-quality, or outright spammy.
It's getting disheartening.
During the pandemic, I managed to land some gigs after just a couple of proposals (and I was a total noob who had just graduated). I even got a long-term client without having to pay a cent.
I actually managed to land a full-time job as a PHP Developer and then I decided to focus only on it after one year.

As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing. From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight.
And if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily. It’s a fair question: Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC?
The short answer: Yes, but it won’t be worth it.

Calculating inventory levels in SQL can be tricky, especially when you need to derive values based on previous rows. In your case, we want to compute a new column, Avail_to_fill, which will be the difference between the Onhand quantity and the Qty ordered for each item. This calculation should depend on the preceding row's result.
Understanding the Problem
The table you provided has several columns: ORDER#, Date, Item, Qty, Onhand, and Avl Fill. The requirement here is to create a new column that shows the available inventory (Onhand minus Qty) line by line and restarts the calculation whenever a new Item is encountered. This behavior can be achieved using Oracle SQL's analytic functions and a common table expression (CTE) for structured queries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're adjusting your schema or moving platforms, you're doing database migration. Whether small or large, migrations help keep your app in sync with changing requirements. This post gives you practical examples and a walkthrough of tools that simplify the process.
1.Schema Migration
Change structure to support new features.
Example:
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_login TIMESTAMP;

Use tools like Flyway or Django ORM to track these in code.
2.Data Migration
Needed when changing storage engines, consolidating databases, or upgrading versions.
Example:
INSERT INTO new_customers SELECT * FROM legacy_customers;

Run these in batches or use a managed service for large datasets.
Add indexes for speed
Create constraints for safety
Normalize tables for better structure
Example:
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

Flyway: Write raw SQL, versioned
Liquibase: Use XML/JSON changelogs
Django: Auto-migrations with Python models
AWS/GCP DMS: Ideal for cloud-native migrations
Updating your schema, moving data, or shifting databases entirely.
Define scope, create backups, test in staging, automate changes.
Not for every change, but yes for version control, rollback, and CI/CD pipelines.
Loss of data integrity, broken constraints, or downtime. Avoid with dry runs and monitoring.
Migrations are part of growing your application the right way. Whether adjusting models or moving cloud platforms, a structured approach with the right tools keeps your data safe.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's digital landscape, software developers face a significant challenge: convincing users that their applications are safe to download and use. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, users have become increasingly cautious about what they install on their devices. This is where code signing emerges as a crucial practice for developers looking to build trust and increase download rates.
Code signing is a security practice that involves applying a digital signature to software or executable files. This signature is an electronic proof that the code comes from a specific publisher and hasn't been tampered with since it was signed.
Think of it like a wax seal on a letter in medieval times—it guaranteed the letter came from the sender and hadn't been opened along the way. Similarly…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Is a Shadow API?


A shadow API is an application programming interface that is created or used without explicit approval from the organization’s IT or security teams. Shadow APIs can emerge from various sources, including developers experimenting with new features, legacy systems that are no longer officially supported but still in use, or services integrated outside of formal IT channels. 
This is part of a series of articles about API security
Unlike official APIs, shadow APIs lack oversight and governance, making them invisible to the security measures typically applied to known and documented APIs. They operate under the radar of standard security and monitoring practices. Because these APIs were not introduced through sanctioned processes, they are excluded from inventory or documentation efforts. 
As a result, shadow APIs present significant risks. They are not subjected to regular security assessments, patches, and compliance checks that would normally be part of an API’s lifecycle management in a secure software development environment.

Like any well-architected system, the solution required robust observability — the ability to track operational behavior, diagnose issues, and maintain visibility across all components. Naturally, Azure Monitor was the go-to choice.
One of the core components of the solution was a custom plugin for Power Platform. To capture application-level telemetry from the plugin, the obvious approach was to use a telemetry client that integrates with Azure Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor. By default, Application Insights allows unauthenticated data ingestion — which makes it a potential target for abuse. To address this, the instance was c…]]></summary>

But behind that simple click lies a complex system working in real-time to deliver seamless, high-quality video.
Video streaming isn't just file downloading — it's a dynamic process involving segmented delivery, adaptive bitrate logic, and encryption.
In this post, we'll explore the inner workings of video streaming
Streaming platforms don’t send one large .mp4 file.

Instead, the video is broken into small segments, typically 2 to 10 seconds long.
This segmented approach enables:
Partial and on-demand loading

Faster seeking

Real-time quality switching
Depending on the protocol:
HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) uses .m3u8 manifest and .ts segments

Quickly searching posts by title.

Handling JSON in Scala can be challenging, especially when dealing with nested JSON strings. In this article, we explore how to effectively decode a JSON object using Circe, a popular library in the Scala ecosystem. Specifically, we want to extract data from a JSON structure where one of the fields is a string that represents another JSON object. This approach is necessary to ensure that we parse and extract information correctly, allowing us to work seamlessly with complex data structures.
Understanding the JSON Structure
The JSON object we receive looks like this:
{"key": "value", "embedded": "{\"foo\": \"bar\"}"}

In this case, the embedded field is a JSON string rather than a direct JSON object. This means that simple decoding techniques may not suffice, and we need to hav…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Java 8 revolutionized how developers write and think about Java code by introducing functional programming concepts. At the heart of this transformation are Lambda Expressions, Functional Interfaces, and the Streams API. These features together promote a more expressive, concise, and readable way to write code that is powerful, efficient, and scalable.
In this comprehensive article, we will dive deep into each of these features, understand the underlying theory, and then walk through practical examples with detailed, line-by-line explanations.
Before Java 8, Java was strictly an object-oriented programming language. Functional programming concepts like passing behavior (not just data) as arguments were difficult and verbose. Java 8 brought in a hybrid model, enabling functional programming…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there! If you've ever built a React app and found it difficult to make your layout look good on both desktop and mobile, you're not alone. Good news? Material UI (aka MUI) makes it easy to create responsive design with its powerful Grid system. Let’s see how you can create a completely responsive layout using MUI Grid, step by step, with code you can copy and customize.

MUI's Grid is based on top of CSS Flexbox, and it works on a 12-column layout system. It means you can divide your layout into sections without much stress, and control different section's behaviour on different screen sizes. Now you don't have to write separate CSS media queries all over the place.

Trump said in a May 7 Truth Social post that a “major trade deal” with a “big, and highly respected, country” would be announced on May 8, which The New York Times reported would be the UK, citing three people familiar with the plans.
Bitcoin inches toward $100,000
When Trump published his post, Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at around $97,759 and has since crept up closer to the psychological $100,000 price level to trade at $99,140 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data.

Base64 encoding turns them into secure ASCII strings compatible with virtually any transmission medium.

Creating visually engaging web content often leads developers to seek ways to draw attention to specific text. One such effect is blinking text, which was once achieved using the deprecated <blink> tag. However, as web standards evolved, the <blink> tag fell out of favor, leaving developers wondering: Is there a standards compliant way of making text blink? In this article, we'll explore modern methods that achieve a similar effect without relying on deprecated elements.
Why the <blink> Tag Was Abandoned
Web standards have changed significantly since the days of the <blink> tag. Introduced in the early HTML specifications, it was intended to help highlight important text. However, as web design principles have matured, the <blink> tag was found to be problematic. Here’s why:

In this post, we’ll break down the four major services you’ll be working with most: Boards, Repos, Pipelines, and Artifacts — and explain how they fit together in a real DevOps lifecycle.
Azure DevOps is a suite of services from Microsoft that supports the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC). It includes tools for planning, version control, CI/CD, package management, and more — all integrated under one roof.
The four core services we’ll focus on are:
Azure Boards – Track work items like epics, user stories, bugs, and tasks

Picture this: It's 3 AM, I'm bleary-eyed, surrounded by empty coffee mugs, and I've just realized I forgot to water my plants. Again. For the third time this week. My succulents are giving me the silent treatment, and I swear my cactus just flipped me off.
That's when it hit me – I'm a programmer, for crying out loud! If I can make computers dance, surely I can make my life a little less... chaotic?
So, fueled by caffeine and the fear of becoming a plant murderer, I embarked on a quest to automate my life using nothing but Python. Spoiler alert: It worked. And it only took 100 lines of code. (Okay, 103 if you count comments, but who's counting?)

Creating a functional and visually appealing navbar is an essential part of web development, especially when using React. In this article, we will explore how to design a navbar where links change colors upon clicking—switching between white and yellow. We will use plain CSS along with React's state management to achieve this effect. This approach is simple enough to accommodate beginners yet effective for creating a clean user interface.
Why Use a Clickable Navbar?
A dynamic navbar enhances user experience by providing visual feedback. When users click a link and it changes color, they instantly understand which page they are on. Additionally, it helps in navigation clarity, improving overall site usability.

PostgreSQL provides a rich variety of index types. Each index type is based on specific data structures and principles, and is suitable for different application scenarios. The following will provide a detailed introduction to these nine main index types.
The B - Tree (balanced multi-way search tree) is a self-balanced tree structure. Each node in it can have multiple child nodes (multi-way). Usually, a B - Tree node contains multiple key-value pairs and pointers to child nodes. For example, an m-order B - Tree node can have at most m child nodes, and at least ⌈m/2⌉ child nodes (except for the root node).

This article outlines a theming strategy I came up with, which I believe is a clean and scalable approach built around those tools. It enables easy support for light/dark modes and beyond (daylight, retro, etc.) with minimal complexity.
tailwind.config.js Isn't Enough for Theming


Traditionally, developers define colors like primary, accent, or background directly in tailwind.config.js:
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    colors: {

A common issue developers face is accessing the selected choice directly from the ParamSpec. Let's dive into how to do this effectively.
Understanding the DropDown and Connect Closure
When you create a DropDown in GTK, you define the choices it contains. In your example, you have created a DropDown with two options:
let choix = [&quot;Choice 1&quot;,&quot;Choice 2&quot;];
let drop_down2 = gtk::DropDown::from_strings(&amp;choix);

Here, choix is an array containing the two options. The DropDown will display these choices in the user interface. To respond to user interaction, you set up a closure that will be executed whenever the selected choice changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the vast universe of software development, Visual Studio Code has emerged as a key tool—an unexpected bridge connecting worlds that once seemed incompatible. It has become a lifeline for developers coming from the GNU/Linux ecosystem, desperately seeking a way to write desktop applications, something they thought was lost in their environment.
Its versatility allows for development in C#, C++, and FPC Pascal, avoiding alternatives like Lazarus, and offering a more modern and robust option. Personally, I’ve found myself using it as an alternative to Visual Studio 2022, since developing a .NET 6, 7, or 8 application on Linux is financially more viable for my business than doing so on Windows.
But here’s the question: Why does Visual Studio Code feel like an orphaned and underappreciated sibling compared to Visual Studio 2022?
Both serve incredible purposes. Visual Studio 2022 is the enterprise-grade powerhouse, while VS Code is the agile alternative—the gateway for many developers coming from GNU/Linux, looking to explore Windows and its tools, or simply wanting to use .NET Core on Linux. That in itself is a massive achievement, a step forward in software evolution.
Because in the end, bluntly speaking, Linux is great... but if it doesn’t pay the bills, what can I do? As developers, we need to produce high-quality software using high-quality tools. That’s why Visual Studio Code becomes the logical and efficient choice—a path that allows us to keep programming in diverse environments while maintaining productivity and financial sustainability.
Ultimately, VS Code isn’t just a code editor… it’s the bridge that unites worlds that once seemed irreconcilable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[之前写的后台的控制程序，我采用的都是用VC或者是C#写完之后然后采用AlwaysUp或者是nssm把自己写的后台程序再给做成一个Windows的服务程序。但后来想了想为什么不自己直接写一个Windows的服务程序呢。所以就开始了写服务程序的历程。
首先大致的说一下C#语言写一个Windwos服务程序的方法。说实话C#想写一个Windows服务程序相对的要简单的多。因为C#已经都给准备好了。就在创建项目的选择Windows服务项目就可以了。然后再添加一个服务安装的组件，改一下相关的配置，如：服务名、启动类型、启动权限或者叫启动时的用户。这些信息就可以了。在写代码的时候只要在开始的里面写上服务启动时需要做的工作，在结束里面写上服务停止时需要收尾的工作就大功告成了。
下面主要是说一下采用VC写Windows服务程序。这个我个人觉得相对来说有几个坑需要避。
第一个坑就是如果你从网上查的话都会说用VC写Windows服务程序的入口主函数是ServiceMain()这个函数。而实际并不是，实际上的程序入口还是从main()这个函数开始的。只不过在这个函数中我们不能做太多的事情，必须要尽快的调用StartServiceCtrlDispatcher()这函数来启动ServiceMain()函数。而且ServiceMain()这个函数的名字也并不一定就是这个，可以自定义。只不过你在网上查的人都会采用这个函数名而已。并非VC语言的规定或者约束。这个函数也只不过是在调用StartServiceCtrlDispatcher()函数的时候的一个参数而已叫什么名字并不重要。
第二坑就是服务状态的变换问题，只有你有ServiceMain()函数中调用了SetServiceStatus()函数来告诉Windows操作系统你的服务程序是开始启动了还时正在运行之中还是正在停止之中才可以。在这方面我从网上查了好长时间没有一个写的清楚的。我开始的时候以为这个函数没什么大用于是把相关的代码给删掉了，结果就会发生服务程序的状态无法改变。比如你在启动服务的时候没有及时的状态改成正在运行的话那么Windows的服务控制台就会一直启动这个服务直到启动超时而报错最后服务的状态就会卡在启动状态无法将服务停止或者删除。如果你能将服务状态进入到正在运行状态，但在发出停止服务的时候如果不能将服务的状修改成停止的话那么Windows也会一直停止这个服务直到停止超时而报错。而且这个服务的状态也会卡在停止的状态无法改变。
第三个坑就是在ServiceMain()函数中在用SetServiceStatus()函数把服务的状态修改成“正在运行”的状态之后必须要调用WaitForSingleObject()函数把这个服务的主线程给卡住然就是是一直等待发出服务停止的信号。所以在真正的主线程中你是无法再做其它的任何的工作的。故如果要想写好一个完整的Windwos服务程序就必须在ServiceMain()函数调用WaitForSingleObject()函数之前将你想做的事情都给加载完毕之后再调用WaitForSingleObject()函数将主线程卡住一直等待停止服务的指令。当停止服务的指令来临的时候再调用SetServiceStatus()函数把服务的状态修改成已经停止。
第四个这个不算是坑了这个算是一个常识。就是服务程序的调试问题。如果想调试Windows服务程序那么就只能采用“附加到进程”的方式。即先从Windows的服务管理器中启动服务，然后从Visual Studio的“调试”菜单中选择“附加到进程”的选项然后再选择自己程序的那个进程就可以了。
总结一下，那就是不论是VC写Windows服务程序还是C#写Windwos服务程序，都会有一个开始服务的初始化函数。而初始化函数中不能有死循环，但一般的服务程序又必须要用死循环，所以一个完整的Windwos服务程序一定是一个多线程的，在初始化的时候就启动其它的想要加载的死循环的线程。还会有一个程序的销毁函数，同样在销毁函数中也不能有无法完成的循环。最后就是Windwos服务程序的调试必须采用附加到进程的方式来进行。]]></summary>

It is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created and remains fixed throughout its lifetime. Arrays are used to organize data efficiently and can be defined and initialized in various ways.
Array - Group of similar datatypes
Why do you use an array?
Arrays are handy when you want to work with multiple values of the same data type. Instead of declaring individual variables for each value, you can group them together in an array, making your code more concise and easier to manage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Dart and stylesheets, particularly those using SCSS/Sass, you might encounter a common issue: the 'Undefined mixin' error. This problem often arises when importing mixins and functions from Bootstrap or any other library. In this article, we'll explore why this error happens and provide a comprehensive solution to fix it.
Understanding the Undefined Mixin Error
The 'Undefined mixin' error in SCSS usually indicates that the compiler cannot find a specific mixin or function that you are trying to use in your stylesheet. In your case, you're trying to utilize a media-breakpoint-down(md) mixin that is part of Bootstrap's SCSS library. The correct order of imports is crucial since Sass relies on the definitions being available in the scope when they're used.

When working with dates in programming, breaking them down into their fundamental components is often the first step in any meaningful manipulation. Most languages provide straightforward functions for this purpose, typically offering the ability to extract the year, month, and day from a date object.
// Extract components from a date
currentDate := time.Now()
year := currentDate.Year()    // Returns the year as an integer (e.g., 2025)
month := currentDate.Month()  // Returns the month as a time.Month (e.g., March)
day := currentDate.Day()      // Returns the day of month as an integer (e.g., 19)

CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows us to create complex web layouts with ease. It enables us to define both rows and columns and provide control over how content is placed within the layout. This is particularly useful for our scenario where we want to create a flexible column layout for different sizes of elements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Bash scripts, managing file paths and filenames can sometimes lead to unexpected sorting behavior. If you're trying to sort an array of complete filenames and want them sorted by just the filename while retaining the full paths, you're not alone in this challenge. In this article, we'll explore a solution that allows you to achieve exactly that.
Why the Issue Occurs
The confusion often arises from how the sort command works in conjunction with the full paths of files. When you try to sort by default, it considers the whole string, which includes the path. This results in sorting that does not reflect the ordering of the filenames, as seen in your request where sort outputs filenames based on their directory path rather than the filename itself.

The SSLCertVerificationError signifies that Python's request to verify the SSL certificate of the server has failed.

Explanation:
If you want somebody not to access specific function through object you can do it by applying the @staticmethod. 
And do not pass 'self' because it will create connection with other attribute.
But if you seen closely general_description is accessible through object and class also. So the question arises does this statement defy us.
Well answer is, Yes, it does.
Here is analogy:
You will kept your screwdriver, hammer or nickel in toolbox, so that somebody want to access it he/she will look for toolbox.


If you travel through airplane doesn't which model of airplane you travel the manual of that plane will remain same like how to tie seatbelt.



Same as goes for static method you just access static method function through class not by object and it doesn't defy its meaning.

When styling buttons with CSS, achieving a seamless hover effect is crucial for a great user experience. The problem arises when you have a hover effect that causes a noticeable flicker when you release the mouse button. This occurs because the button transitions back to its default state before returning to the hover state, creating an undesirable visual effect. In this article, we'll explore why this flicker happens and provide a solution to prevent it.
Why Does the Flicker Happen?
The flickering effect you noticed is common when using CSS transitions for hover states. Here's a breakdown of what occurs:

Avoid overload ambiguity at compile time
Let’s walk through how this works, when to use it, and how to avoid introducing confusion.
When adding a new overload to a public API, especially one that overlaps in parameter shape, you risk:

The orphan rule in Rust restricts you from implementing conversions like impl From<Foo1Error> for BarError across distinct crates, leading to cluttered code due to multiple map_err calls.
Understanding the Problem
In Rust, error handling is often a source of complexity when integrating external crates, particularly when each crate has its own error type. When you have to return a unified error type, like tonic::Status in this case, you may find yourself writing numerous utility functions to map errors from individual crates to a common error type.

But dig a little deeper, and something else almost always comes up:
Cargo.
Rust’s package manager and build tool isn’t just “nice to have.”
Now imagine Rust without it:
No standard project layout.
No dependency management.
No easy testing or publishing.
No cargo build, cargo test, or cargo run.
Just a complex, opinionated systems language... with zero guidance or tooling.
It would be a beautiful disaster—full of promise, but hard to harness.
Shell is ancient, universal, and indispensable.
Despite its power, shell scripting is stuck in the dark ages:
Scripts are ad-hoc and fragile.
Logic is duplicated everywhere.

Two crypto firms, Arbitrum and the Solana Foundation, are reportedly vying to become partners in the project. Tokenization is the process of turning real-world assets, like stocks, real estate, or commodities, into digital tokens that can be traded on a blockchain.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug.

Starting in C# 13, the language lifts one of its long-standing restrictions: the inability to use ref struct types, ref variables, or unsafe contexts in iterator (yield) or async methods.
This evolution is critical for developers working with performance-sensitive data, particularly through types like:
System.Span<T>
System.ReadOnlySpan<T>
Custom ref struct types

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[^ in Object Initializers


The ^ operator (read as "from the end") has been part of C# since version 8, allowing developers to easily access elements from the end of collections:
int last = myArray[^1]; // Last element

However, until C# 13, you couldn’t use ^ inside object initializers. This restriction has now been lifted, giving developers more expressive and compact ways to initialize collections directly.
Let’s explore how this change improves array initialization syntax and simplifies common patterns.
Prior to C# 13:

countdown.buffer[^1] = 0; // Valid

But you could not write:

};

Now, this syntax is fully supported.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In modern C#, method groups — collections of methods with the same name but different signatures — are frequently used in scenarios like:
Passing methods as delegates
LINQ projections
Action<>, Func<> assignments
Method references in event subscriptions
C# 13+ introduces an important enhancement in how the compiler handles these method groups by optimizing the resolution of a natural type (i.e., an expected delegate type) for a method group.
Let’s explore what changed, how it affects overload resolution, and what it means for you as a C# expert.
A method group is a set of method overloads identified by a shared name:
void Log(string message) { ... }
void Log(string message, LogLevel level) { ... }

Calling Log without parentheses creates a method group, which the compiler tries to match to…]]></summary>

ETH price could recover if the Pectra upgrade leads to a surge in DApp and Ethereum network activity. 

Ethereum successfully implemented a key network upgrade on May 7, but Ether (ETH) price and its derivatives metrics showed little response to the upgrade. The lackluster response surprised traders and led analysts to question whether ETH still has a real chance of climbing 22% to retake the $2,200 level.

For example, many graph algorithms and machine learning operations scale as O(n²) or worse with data size. A seemingly modest 10x increase in data can suddenly demand 100x or 1000x more computation.

So what's interesting about the above example, at least to me is it actually runs with javascript disabled!?! So only built in the browser commands will work, but I think this is cool. Really primitive elements that add a better UX to the user can now run in environments without javascript. Also this pattern has better Accessibility out of the box.
You can also write your own custom js events and handlers...
Creating custom commands

The journey of speech recognition technology started as early as the 1950s, predominantly focusing on isolated word recognition. Early systems, such as IBM's "Shoebox," recognized a mere 16 words. The evolution accelerated with the advent of hidden Markov models (HMM) in the 1980s, which allowed for continuous speech recognition. The 1990s saw the introduction of statistically based systems, leveraging vast amounts of data to improve accuracy.

Cointelegraph reached out to Coinbase but was unable to get a response by the time of publication.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not long ago, “AI in SaaS” felt like a buzzword, a chatbot here, some automation there. But in 2025, it’s clear:
I recently made a quick YouTube Short that summarizes this shift in just 60 seconds. But I wanted to share a bit more context with the dev.to community, because many of us are building this future.
Here’s what’s really changing:
AI handles what used to be the boring, manual work, form filling, task assignment, ticket tagging, report generation. Not only is it faster, but it actually lets teams focus on solving real problems.
AI isn’t just reacting anymore, it’s learning. We’re seeing apps that adjust to each user: what they click, when they drop off, which features they ignore. AI then reshapes the experience in real time. Feels like magic (but it's models).
Whether it’s predicting churn, forecasting demand, or recommending next steps, smart SaaS tools are becoming proactive. This gives users (and product teams) a serious advantage.
At ClickIT, we’ve been working with startups and mid-size companies to integrate this kind of AI into their SaaS platforms. It’s wild how quickly things evolve once AI becomes part of your architecture, especially when the goal is to scale fast without losing control.
Here’s the video I mentioned, just 60 seconds, made to spark ideas:
How AI Is Revolutionizing SaaS in 2025
Are you already integrating AI into your product?
If not ❌ — What’s holding you back?


And if yes ✅ — What has surprised you the most?



Would love to hear how other devs, founders, and engineers here are approaching the AI shift in SaaS.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Day 23 of the 30 Days of Linux Challenge!

Today we’re entering the world of automation using one of the most powerful tools available in the Red Hat ecosystem: Ansible.
Ansible lets you automate repetitive tasks — like updating systems, installing packages, configuring files, and managing entire server fleets — using simple, human-readable YAML files.
What is Ansible?
Install Ansible on Red Hat Linux
Configure Local Inventory
Run Ad-Hoc Commands
Write Your First Playbook
Run the Playbook
Try It Yourself
Why This Matters
Ansible is a declarative automation engine:
Uses YAML playbooks

Connects over SSH (agentless)
Scales from single node to 1000s of systems
Works perfectly with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and more
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms

Verify version:
ansible --version

Configure Local Inventory
Create an inventory file:
mkdir ~/ansible
Add this to target your own machine:
localhost ansible_connection=local
Test connection:
ansible localhost -m ping -i hosts

Expected result:
json
List all users:
ansible localhost -m command -a "whoami" -i hosts

Install a package:
ansible localhost -m dnf -a "name=htop state=present" -i hosts --become
Write Your First Playbook
Example playbook:
yaml
name: Basic Setup Playbook
hosts: localhost
become: true
tasks:
- name: Ensure NTP is installed
  dnf:
    name: chrony
    state: present

- name: Start and enable NTP service
  service:
    name: chronyd
    state: started
    enabled: true


ansible-playbook -i hosts setup.yml
This will:
Install htop and chrony
Start and enable the chronyd time service

🧪 Practice tasks:
Install another package using a playbook (e.g. git, tree)
Use Ansible to start or restart a service
Create a user with the user module
Run an ad-hoc uptime or df -h check across multiple hosts
With Ansible, you can:
✅ Eliminate repetitive manual tasks
Whether you’re a sysadmin or DevOps engineer, Ansible is your command center for intelligent automation.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Swapping variables is one of the most basic procedures that are done in programming.
The first approach -and usually the most used by far- is to swap using a third variable, commonly named temporal variable. I'm sure you have seen it already.
void swap(int* a, int* b) {
    int temp = *b
    *b = *a
    *a = temp
}

Yeah, that's a lot of pointers for explaining a swap. Blame C, not me 😒.
Either way the process is the same in all languages:
The value of variable b is stored in a temporal variable
The value of variable a is stored in b
The value stored in the temporal variable is moved to a
I don't think it is necessary to say that the same process can be done replacing a with b and b with a

This is a common concern for developers who want stable environments for their applications.
Understanding Pyenv and Homebrew
pyenv is a popular tool for managing multiple Python versions on your machine without affecting the system’s default Python installation. By setting a Python version with pyenv global 3.11.9, you're informing the system to use Python 3.11.9 whenever a Python command is executed.

Bitcoin’s realized capitalization hit a record $890 billion, reflecting strong investor conviction as long-term and short-term holders increased allocations. 

Large Bitcoin holders with over 1,000 BTC have accumulated significantly since March 2025, reflecting the Q1 2024 trend. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025. The surge also marks the metric’s third consecutive week of record-breaking growth.

APIs have become the lifeblood of modern digital ecosystems. Ensuring scalability, fairness, and resilience is no longer optional—it’s fundamental. Traditional rate limiting techniques offer a static shield against abuse and overload, but they can fall short when faced with dynamic, ever-shifting workloads. Inspired by the adaptive system design strategies from Alex Xu’s acclaimed System Design Interview series, this article explores a powerful, nuanced alternative: building adaptive rate limiters using AIMD (Additive Increase, Multiplicative Decrease). We delve into how AIMD works, why Redis is an ideal backend, and provide a full C# implementation to empower developers building the next generation of cloud-native APIs.

Understanding this will not only enhance the readability of your console output but will also aid significantly in debugging issues and analyzing data patterns.

Unlike LangChain’s Python-centric abstraction, SynTeam templates run entirely within the LLM context, allowing you to:
Design execution flows without writing code
Assign responsibility explicitly to each processing block
Keep your logic transparent and reproducible inside the LLM session itself

  Problem:


You are given an n x n square matrix. Write a function is_toeplitz(matrix) that checks whether the matrix is a Toeplitz matrix.
A Toeplitz matrix is one where every descending diagonal from top-left to bottom-right (↘️) contains the same elements.
Consider this matrix:
6 7 8
4 6 7
1 4 6

The diagonals are:
[1],
[4, 4],
[6, 6, 6],
[7, 7],
[8]
All elements in each diagonal are equal — so this is a Toeplitz matrix ✅.
To check if a matrix is Toeplitz:
Loop through each element in the matrix (excluding the last row and column).
For each element, compare it with the one diagonally down-right from it.
If any of those pairs don’t match, return False.
If the loop completes without mismatches, return True.
from typing import List

def is_toeplitz(matrix: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    n = len(matrix)

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i + 1 < n and j + 1 < n:
                if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i + 1][j + 1]:
                    return False

    return True

matrix = [

O Observer é um padrão de projeto comportamental que define uma relação de dependência entre objetos, onde um objeto (o sujeito) notifica automaticamente outros objetos (os observadores) sempre que seu estado muda. Ele é muito útil quando várias partes do sistema precisam reagir a mudanças em um mesmo ponto.
Esse padrão promove o desacoplamento entre quem emite o evento e quem reage a ele, permitindo que novos observadores sejam adicionados ou removidos em tempo de execução, sem alterar o sujeito.
Em resumo, o Observer estabelece um mecanismo de notificação automática, garantindo que todos os interessados estejam atualizados sempre que algo importante acontece.
As classes que devem reagir a mudanças se inscrevem no sujeito responsável por emitir essas mudanças.
A classe principal recebe os observadores via o método addObserver(), registrando as implementações interessadas em ser notificadas.
O método newStockData() executa a ação principal e, em seguida, notifica todos os observadores inscritos, permitindo que eles executem suas responsabilidades de forma independente.
Assim caso surja uma demanda de adicionar uma nova açãoao newStockData, você não precisaria modificar a classe]]></summary>

In this tutorial, we will explore how to effectively join the AccountingEntity and PeriodEntity when using Entity Framework Core in C#. The aim is to filter AccountingEntity based on a Group parameter while ensuring the Period property is properly initialized from the Periods table. This is a common scenario when dealing with related database tables in a fixed schema situation.
Understanding the Relationship
We are working with two tables: periods and accounting. The primary key in the periods table is a combination of group and id, while the accounting table has periodid that corresponds to id in periods. The relationship between these tables is established by matching accounting.periodid with periods.id, although no foreign key is defined in the schema.

While there are plenty of ready-made templates and tools available, I wanted to challenge myself to build one from scratch. It was a great opportunity to practice core HTML skills and see how structure and content come together in a real-world project.
💡 The objective was simple: design a clean, professional, and structured resume that highlights my background, experience, and skills. I used semantic HTML elements like , , , and  to make the document easy to read and accessible.
🛠️ Key takeaways from this project:
Strengthened my understanding of HTML semantics and layout.
Realized how effective clean structure can be in making content user-friendly.
Gained confidence to move forward with styling (CSS) and possibly hosting it online.
📄 Why this matters: Creating your resume in HTML is not just about having a digital copy—it's a hands-on way to practice front-end skills, personalize your portfolio, and show recruiters or peers your commitment to learning and self-improvement.
🚀 Next steps:
Apply CSS to enhance visual appeal.
Make the layout responsive for mobile devices.
Host it online and maybe even link it to a personal portfolio.
🔗 Final thoughts: If you're a beginner or intermediate developer, I highly recommend trying this out. It’s a simple but impactful way to sharpen your skills while building something meaningful and uniquely yours.

A regular expression (also “regexp”, or just “reg”) consists of a pattern and optional flags. In short, it is the method of matching strings to a pattern.
Two syntaxes can be used to create a regular expression.
const regexp = new RegExp("pattern","flags");

OR
const regexp = /pattern/; //without flags
const regexp = /pattern/flags; 

Regex should be written within forward-slashes /..../. These slashes play the same role as quotes in strings.
The main difference between the syntaxes is that when the regular expression remains constant, use a pattern with a slash for better performance, but if the regular expression is changing, or you d…]]></summary>

        break;
    } else {
        System.out.println("Not occur");
    }

}
sc.close();

}
}
Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) (Worst case: checks all elements).

Space Complexity: O(1) (No extra space needed).

When to Use Linear Search?
✔ Small datasets.
Simple but inefficient for large datasets.

Works on any list (sorted or unsorted).

Easy to implement in Java.

For faster searches, consider Binary Search (O(log n)) if the list is sorted. 🚀]]></summary>

A bad connection strategy can lead to memory leaks, crashes, or endless retry loops.
In this blog, I’ll show you how I built a resilient Redis integration in Express.js using ioredis, lazy loading, and a circuit breaker with opossum.

At first, I used the classic approach:
const redis = new Redis(); // 🤷‍♂️ at the top level

But I quickly ran into issues:
Connection errors on startup if Redis wasn’t ready.
Too many retry attempts without a proper limit.
No fallback strategy during Redis downtime.
So, I rebuilt the entire integration with three key ideas:
✅ Lazy Loading
instead of connecting at startup, I created a singleton getter that initializes Redis on first use:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Functional programming has gained traction in modern development due to its ability to produce more predictable, modular, and testable code. In this post, we explore four fundamental principles: immutability, function composition, pure functions, and arrow functions.
Immutability means that once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of mutating data, we return new versions with the desired updates.
✅ Why is it useful?
Prevents unpredictable side effects
Easier debugging and testing
Ideal for concurrent environments (like React or Redux)
❌ Mutable example:
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
user.age = 26; // Mutation

✅ Immutable example:
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
const updatedUser = { ...user, age: 26 }; // New copy with changes

We’re entering the post-smartphone era. Not with a bang, but through quiet disruption. And it’s already on your body.

The Rise of the Wearable Web
I wear a smartwatch that tracks my health, receives notifications, and lets me respond instantly.
Samsung just launched a smart ring — one more layer of ambient computing wrapped around our daily lives.
And of course, I can speak to an AI assistant and get intelligent, contextual responses without touching a screen.
This is no longer sci-fi — this is now.

A New Hub: The Invisible Puck
Imagine:
A tiny 5G/6G puck lives in your backpack
Your glasses are your screen
Your ring is your security token
Your watch handles notifications and health
Voice becomes your primary interface
AI becomes your operating system
No more swiping. No more “app folders”. No more trying to type with your thumb while walking.
Screens Are Becoming Optional
Even today, I can ask my glasses to play a song, call someone, or answer a question — all without touching a smartphone. I don’t need a “phone” to live connected. I just need smart inputs, wearable endpoints, and a cloud intelligence layer.
What This Means
App developers will have to rethink interaction: conversational, contextual, multi-device.
Privacy, identity, and edge computing will take centre stage — because the phone as a walled garden will be gone.
We’ll be more present — or at least, less distracted by rectangles.

The Debate Begins
Will we embrace ambient computing — or push back against losing physical control?
One thing’s clear: the era of staring at your hand all day is giving way to something new.
So here’s the question:
Would you give up your phone if you could wear the web instead?]]></summary>

One such error, as you've described, occurs when the expected dimensions of your model's output do not match the shape of the provided labels (targets) during training. Let's explore this issue further and provide solutions to resolve it.
Understanding the Error
The error message you received states: Error when checking target: expected dense_Dense2 to have 2 dimension(s) but got array with shape 2,5,2. This indicates that the output layer of your model was expecting a different shape for its targets than what it received. In simpler terms, the model's structure is out of sync with your training data's shape.
Why This Happens

But sometimes, I need to tap into the power of AWS for testing, dev work, or hybrid projects. In this post, I’m spilling the beans on how I bridged my home network with two AWS regions (ap-south-1 and us-east-1) using Tailscale, EC2, and VPC Peering. The result? A secure, low-latency network that feels like magic. Let’s dive in!
My home lab is my sandbox for coding, experimenting, and breaking things (gently). But when I need AWS’s managed services—like serverless functions or storage—I don’t want to deal with public IPs or clunky SSH setups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a lot of noise on "MCP (Model Context Protocol)" and as someone at the forefront of technology we have no choice but to follow it up. Often, despite the initial waryneess the AI hype drains my energy, some careful study turns out to generate useful insights.
MCP is a protocol, but the majority of the protocol work is already done when OpenAI annouced tool use for ChatGPT. What matters now is the standardization process of the publisher of MCP, i.e. Anthropic (Creator of Claude models and tools). In addition to the publications, MCP offers server/client implementations for C#, Python, JavaScript - and that can speed up and streamline the development process.
Whenever an experienced developers sees the tool use API (e.g. from OpenAI), they will immediately think of automatic code generation and streamline and tool definition process, and develop custom tooling to define those tools and serve those tools. MCP offers a ready-to-use (language-of-your-choice) implementation for a stated server.
But here is a critical observation: does MCP has anything to do with AI/LLM at all? It's reinforcing what should have already been done: making systems reflective and accessible from an outside system. Here is a pun: it requires existing systems to be more reasonable (also see Forbes article on GEO).
Traditionally, when a software is developed if the original developer doesn't expose useful APIs then power users have no obvious way of automating it, except through the more hacky GUI automation route. Now with the pressure of AI, vendors have to expose useful interface. LLM with its natural language nature makes it easiser for them to pick, compared to picking a more specific scripting language (or rest API), especially when the MCP server/client framework is stated and uses JsonRPC.

TDD = Test-Driven Development

BDD = Behavior-Driven Development
BDD is all about the following mindset: Do not test code. Test behavior.
So it's a shift of the testing mindset. This is why in BDD, we also introduced new terms:
Test suites become specifications,
Test cases become scenarios,
We don't test code, we verify behavior.
Let's make this clear by an example.
If you are not familiar with Java, look in the repo files for other languages (I've added: Java, Python, JavaScript, C#, Ruby, Go).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ollama makes it easy to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your own computer. This simple guide will show you how to install Ollama, run your first model, and use it in a Python script.
 Download the installer from  ollama.ai

 Open the downloaded file and drag Ollama to your Applications folder
 Open Ollama from your Applications
 Download the installer from  ollama.ai

 Run the .exe file and follow the installation wizard
 Ollama will start automatically when installation completes
 Just run this




curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

Ollama is also available as a Docker container:
docker pull ollama/ollama  
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama

Let’s try Llama 3.2 1B, a compact but capable model:
ollama run llama3.2:1b

The first time you run this command, Ollama will download the model. Once it’s ready, you’ll see a prompt where you can start chatting:
>>> Why is the sky blue?  
The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, the shorter blue wavelengths of light are scattered more by air molecules than the longer red wavelengths. This scattered blue light comes to us from all directions in the sky, making the sky appear blue during the day.

To exit the Ollama terminal, you can:
  Type  /bye  and press Enter
  Press Ctrl+D (on macOS/Linux)
  Press Ctrl+C twice
Here are some useful commands to get you started:
### List all your downloaded models  
ollama list

### Download a model without running it  
ollama pull llama3.2:1b

### Remove a model you no longer need  
ollama rm llama3.2:1b

### Get information about a model  
ollama info llama3.2:1b

Once you’re comfortable with the basics, you can try the Ollama Python library to integrate it in your Python applications. Check this article  Using Ollama with Python: A Simple Guide.
Enjoy the freedom of running AI locally with Ollama!]]></summary>

If your child has ever asked this, it’s the perfect time to introduce them to HTML—the language behind every website. In this beginner-friendly guide, we’ll explore why HTML is a great first programming language for kids and how to teach it in a fun, engaging way.
Unlike abstract coding concepts, HTML lets kids see immediate results—change a tag, refresh the browser, and voilà! The page updates.
HTML teaches:
Structure (how headings, paragraphs, and images fit together)
Problem-solving (debugging missing closing tags)
Kids can build:
Personal fan pages (for games, sports, or hobbies)
Interactive stories with links and images
Simple games (like quizzes)
After HTML, kids can easily learn:

In my journey through C++17, I stumbled upon the std::byte type and discovered some perplexing behavior that left me scratching my head. The main question is whether this behavior is intended by the C++ standards or if it's a quirk due to the compiler or operating system I am using.
Understanding std::byte
The std::byte type introduced in C++17 is designed to encapsulate the idea of a byte without its conventional mathematical interpretations. Unlike integers, std::byte doesn't implicitly convert to numeric types, which can lead to some interesting outcomes when performing operations with it. In the example I encountered, I defined a std::byte variable and used std::to_integer to convert it to different integer types.
The Code Example

Are you looking to enhance your AM Charts 4 bar chart with stacked columns? In this guide, I'll walk you through adding a series of stacked bars behind existing line and column series to make your data visualization more effective. Creating stacked bars can be tricky, especially with the requirements of filling the entire width of the chart. Let's dive into the issue and provide a comprehensive solution.
Understanding the Problem
Before we start coding, let’s discuss the challenges: the new stacked bars may all be overlapping each other, and they don't seem to fill the chart width as intended. This can result from how your series and data properties are set.

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Safeheron, a digital asset infrastructure provider based in Singapore, has introduced an open-source Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) framework. This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

XRP price is up 2% on May 7, buoyed by US-China trade talk optimism, with key support at $2.08 critical for sustained recovery.

Whale accumulation signals XRP price strength.

XRP price must hold above $1.83–$2.00 support to continue upside, analysts say.

XRP (XRP) price displayed strength on May 7, rising 2% over the last 24 hours after news of possible US-China trade talks flipped investor sentiment. 
XRP price remains above $2.00 at the time of writing, as several analysts highlight the key support levels the asset should hold for a sustainable recovery to new all-time highs.

Hugo 是最受欢迎的开源静态网站生成器之一。用户可以使用 Hugo 来快速搭建自己的网站。
在mac上面，可以使用以下命令来安装hugo:
brew install hugo


安装完之后可以使用 hugo version 来查看是否安装好:

安装完 hugo 之后，就可以使用 hugo 来搭建自己的blog网站了。
hugo new site my-blog 来创建一个名为 my-blog 的网站。

cd my-blog
git init

在创建好网站之后，需要选择一个theme。这里有很多主题可供选择：hugo themes
git submodule add https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even.git themes/even


themes/even/exampleSite/config.toml 拷贝到当前目录，并覆盖 hugo.toml
cp themes/even/exampleSite/config.toml hugo.toml

当配置好主题之后，就可以创建自己的blog了。
hugo new content content/post/my-first-post.md 即可创建一篇blog。
content/post/ 下面会出现一个新的md文件。

当前面的配置好之后，就可以使用 hugo server 来启动一个hugo server。


draft,在hugo server 模式下并不会显示draft的blog。
hugo server -D。

以上就可以完成了blog网站的搭建了。

Your goal is to ensure that MATLAB can interact with your function without errors, particularly the one stating 'function is undefined for arguments of type "double".' In this article, we'll explore how to properly set up the FUN parameter in lsqcurvefit and ensure your data is fit appropriately.
Understanding lsqcurvefit


lsqcurvefit is designed to solve curve fitting problems by minimizing the sum of squares of nonlinear functions. It requires several inputs, including an initial guess for the parameters, the data points you want to fit, and a function that calculates the model predictions.…]]></summary>

  Habit #1: Educate yourself outside of work


If you’re not learning outside of work, you’re falling behind.
Even if you have the best employer in the world, your education is your responsibility.
So, at least once every 2–4 weeks:
Pick up books like The Pragmatic Programmer, Effective TypeScript, or Advanced React


Read blog posts from experts like Matt Pocock (Total TypeScript), Josh Comeau (joshwcomeau.com), Kent C. Dodds (Epic React), etc.


Watch courses to review your basics (Udemy, FrontendMasters, etc.)

Meet the HTTP proxy — a powerful intermediary that stands between your device and the internet. At its core, an HTTP proxy processes and forwards your HTTP requests, essentially acting as a gateway. Instead of your browser connecting directly to a website, the proxy server does the job on your behalf, masking your IP address and offering a range of added benefits.
To really grasp what an HTTP proxy does, you need to understand its building blocks. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the standard protocol for transferring data online — everything from browsing websites to interacting with web applications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When dealing with variable length arrays (VLAs) in C, a common concern arises regarding the lifetime of such arrays when a function call is made after their declaration. According to the C17 final draft document N2176, the lifetime of an object, including a VLA, extends from its declaration until the program execution leaves the scope of that declaration. This statement often leads to questions about whether calling a function immediately after declaring a VLA results in ending its lifetime.
To clarify, let's first understand what a variable length array is and its properties. A VLA is a type of array in C where the size is determined at runtime rather than at compile-time. This feature makes VLAs quite flexible for situations where the size of data is not known until the program runs.

Anyway later on whenever I used to get time I used to ask AI tools to help me teach rust and write a BST specifically. I used Gemini and ChatGPT and both gave solutions as well. I could understand their code but still couldn't understand how they got there. They used Rc, RefCell etc. which I understand theoretically but never understood when and how to use it properly.

Remember that old external hard drive you bought, thinking, "This will last me forever!"? Or the frantic "disk space low" warnings that send you scrambling to delete precious files? We've all been there. In the digital age, data is exploding – from your cat photos and application logs to massive datasets for machine learning and critical business backups. The traditional ways of storing this data just don't scale efficiently or cost-effectively.
What if you had a storage solution that was virtually infinite, incredibly durable, accessible from anywhere, and could adapt its cost based on how you use your data? That's the promise of cloud object storage, and Amazon S3 is the undisputed king of this domain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This tutorial was originally published on IBM Developer by Markus Eisele
Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java stack tailored for GraalVM and OpenJDK HotSpot. Quarkus offers incredibly fast boot times, low RSS memory consumption, and a fantastic developer experience with features like live coding.
This quick start guide gets you up and running with Quarkus on macOS, including necessary tools. You will build a basic database application using Quarkus, Java 17, PostgreSQL, and Hibernate ORM Panache. While Hibernate ORM is the standard, powerful Jakarta Persistence implementation capable of complex mappings, it doesn't always make the most common tasks trivial. Hibernate ORM with Panache is Quarkus's solution to this, focusing specifically on making your data entities and repositories simple, straightforward, and fun to write by reducing boilerplate code for common persistence operations.
We'll use standard macOS tools and package managers where possible. These are the essential tools you'll need to complete this tutorial:
- Podman
- SDKMAN
- Java 17
- Quarkus CLI
- Maven
Optionally, you can also install a code editor.
Quarkus integrates seamlessly with containers, especially for development services like databases and other sytems. Podman is a daemonless container engine alternative to Docker.
On Mac, each Podman machine is backed by a virtual machine. Once installed, the podman command can be run directly from the Unix shell in Terminal, where it remotely communicates with the podman service running in the Machine VM. It is almost transparent in usage to Docker and easy to use for development.
Install Podman. Find the latest Podman release on the GitHub Release page, and download the binary for your system architecture. At the time of writing, the latest release was v5.4.1. Install either the unversal pkg installer or the arm or amd version.

First up is the default Unity script templates that furnished with new installs. While in the beginning it can be valuable to see the Start and Update methods with comments telling you when they are called, I no longer need that to be my starting point for every MonoBehaviour script I create.
Of course, that's not the only template you'll see in Unity, and we can change all of them to be whatever we want. Here's how I do it.
On Windows, you should be able to find all the script templates at C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.0.43f1\Editor\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates.

A global database that no one owns.
Immutable — once a record is added, it can't be changed.
Updated via code (smart contracts), not people or banks.
Built for trustless transactions. No middlemen needed.
No need to trust a CEO, just trust the code.

Of course, the way we work has changed. We need fewer people focused solely on typing out code without understanding the bigger picture. Instead, we need more people who can design systems, think at a higher level about components, understand system architecture, follow programming best practices, and still be able to fix deep issues in AI-generated code.

Misconfigured Amazon S3 buckets are a leading cause of accidental data exposure in the cloud, resulting in regulatory fines, reputational damage, and costly data breaches. In this lab, we will look at a scenario that uses AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager Automation to automatically detect and remediate Amazon S3 buckets when Public Access Block settings are disabled.
If Block Public Access is disabled on a bucket, either accidentally or unauthorized, AWS will automatically detect the non-compliant configuration and restore the secure settings.
An AWS account with an IAM user that has AdministratorAccess.
First, we create a non-compliant S3 bucket. (Since this lab tests for missing Block Public Access settings, start by deliberately misconfiguring a bucket):

Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) improves how AI models find and generate relevant information, making responses more accurate and useful.

The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

Introduction
What is the find Command?
Core find Commands
Real-World Scenario: find Command
Conclusion
Let's Connect

Welcome back to Day 14 of this practical Linux challenge! Today, we are diving into one of the most useful Linux commands: find.
This command helps you search for files and folders fast, flexible, and powerful.

find Command?


The find command is used to look for files and directories in your system based on conditions like:
Name
Size
File type
Date modified
User ownership
And more...
This is especially useful in production environments where systems grow large and messy fast.

find Commands


Basic Syntax for find is
find [path] [condition] [action]

# Example 

find /home -name "file.txt"    - # This searches for file.txt inside the /home directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AWS Lambda is a go-to service for building scalable, event-driven applications — but with great (serverless) power comes great responsibility.
Here are some practical security best practices to keep your Lambda functions secure in 2025:
✅ 1. Use the Principle of Least Privilege
Create dedicated IAM roles for each Lambda function.
Grant only the permissions required for that function to operate.
Use IAM policies with explicit allow/deny for tighter control.
🔐 2. Secure Environment Variables
Instead:
Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store to securely manage credentials, API keys, and tokens.
Access them during function runtime using IAM roles.
🌐 3. VPC Integration for Sensitive Resources
Place it inside a VPC for better network isolation.
Use private subnets with minimal internet exposure.
Attach VPC endpoints for secure AWS service access.
📊 4. Monitor and Log Everything
Amazon CloudWatch Logs for tracking function output and errors.
CloudWatch Metrics to monitor:
Invocation counts
Duration
Throttles and errors
Optionally, integrate with AWS X-Ray for tracing.
📦 5. Enable Versioning and Aliases
Use Lambda versioning to avoid overwriting stable code.
Use aliases (like dev, prod) to route traffic between versions easily.
Helps in rollbacks and gradual deployments.
🚀 Get Started
Start applying these best practices today to make your AWS Lambda functions secure, resilient, and production-ready in 2025.]]></summary>

Part 1
Part 2
Here I will show why this library is actually isomorphic. I'm going to incorporate that sign-in and sign-up examples into a simple Node.js application.

The goal of CI/CD isn’t just “automatic deployments.” It’s about building confidence in your deployments and being ready when things go wrong. Set up your pipeline to be predictable, repeatable, and easy to debug — because someday, it will break.
✅ Automate to recover, not just to deploy.
Don't Cache Config Before .env Is Ready

We have repeatedly emphasized the importance and necessity of software testing during development and real-life runtime cycles. Path testing, a key process in the testing procedure, is often used in designing test cases. It is a structural testing technique that uses the program’s source code to identify every possible executable path. This helps detect errors and bugs along defined program routes. In this article, we will explore a specific approach to path testing known as the Basis Path Test and its nuances.
Basis path testing often referred to as structured testing, is a white box testing method (testing the software’s internal programming, structure, etc.) used to design test cases. It is performed based on the control-flow graph or log…]]></summary>

You might be looking for ways to implement a grid layout while ensuring that each row is visually distinct by having full row borders, rather than just borders around individual cells. In this article, we will explore how to achieve this effectively.
Understanding the Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout is a powerful tool that enables developers to create complex web layouts with ease. The problem you've encountered arises when attempting to give a clear separation between rows using borders without affecting the individual cells. Instead of applying borders to each cell, we need a different approach to make the entire row's border visibly distinct.

Furthermore, the automatic certificate creation in SafeLine WAF, requires port 80 to be free on the NAS. Make sure that the port is not used by any other application, otherwise certificate generation will fail with the error that port 80 is already in use.

As infrastructure has evolved from monoliths to microservices spread across multiple clouds, our approach to monitoring and maintaining these systems needs to evolve too.
Enter AI in IT monitoring - a fundamental shift in how we detect, diagnose, and resolve issues. Let's dive into why traditional approaches are falling short and how AIOps is changing the game.
Modern infrastructure has pushed traditional monitoring approaches beyond their breaking point. Here's why:
Traditional Monitoring Approach:
1. Set static thresholds for metrics
2. Generate alert when threshold crossed

I get that some people are worried AI will take their jobs. Honestly, I don’t think that’s the right question. It’s less about “Will AI replace me?” and more about “How can I use AI to level up and stay ahead?”

When integrating Google OAuth for authentication in your application, you might encounter various errors. One common issue is the ERROR 403: Google disallowed user agent, especially if your code works perfectly on Android but fails on iPhone. This error message usually indicates that Google is rejecting the request due to the user agent string that your app is sending. Let's explore why this happens and how to fix it.
Understanding the Issue
The ERROR 403: Google disallowed user agent typically occurs when Google’s servers identify an untrusted or unsupported user agent accessing their OAuth service. User agents represent the application type, operating system, vendor, and version of the browser, and if the string does not match Google's expectations or security policies, the …]]></summary>

Go is a compiled language with built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels.
Whether it's handling multiple HTTP requests or processing data-heavy tasks, Go offers consistent and high performance with minimal memory overhead. Its lightweight concurrency model is often simpler and more efficient than JavaScript’s event loop and async/await system.
Go is statically typed, which helps catch errors early during compilation.

Roblox's scripting ecosystem has exploded in recent years — and so has the need for tools that empower developers to understand, test, and interact with Lua-based environments. At DeltaDevs, we created Delta Executor, a performance-first, cross-platform executor tailored for Roblox scripts on Android and iOS.
Many tools in the Roblox ecosystem are outdated, unsupported, or overly complex for mobile users. Delta Executor solves that with:
Script execution that’s stable across devices
A secure framework with memory-safe design
Keyless access for paid users (and fair key-based access for free users)
Smooth compatibility across Android, iOS, and emulators for PC
We built it from the ground up to handle the latest anti-cheat systems Roblox introduced in 2025. Here’s how we bypassed them.
-- Delta Executor Example
print("Hello from Delta Executor on Mobile!")

You can load, run, and debug scripts just like this on mobile devices using our tool. Full support for popular script libraries and obfuscation is built in.
While built for mobile-first use, Delta Executor also runs on Windows using emulators like BlueStacks or LDPlayer.
Want to see how it works? Visit our Executor Overview Page.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In tech, we’re wired for growth—more velocity, more releases, more impact, more headcount.
But lately, I’ve been asking myself: Where does it stop?
I’ve led high-performing teams, shipped at scale, climbed the ladder. But with each new role, I noticed a pattern—what looked like “success” on paper often came with hidden trade-offs: less time with family, more stress, fewer pauses to reflect.
We’re told to aim for the next title, the bigger compensation package, the unicorn IPO—as if each step up will quiet the internal noise. But it doesn’t.
Even at the top, many feel like they’re still chasing something just out of reach.
And here’s the kicker: when wealth and power concentrate, whether in tech or society, others get squeezed. I’ve seen brilliant engineers burn out, not because they weren’t good enough—but because the system kept telling them they had to want more.
But what if the real clarity doesn’t come from achieving more—but from needing less?
Less chaos.
I’ve found meaning in simpler things—mentoring a junior dev, walking outside between meetings, unplugging for dinner with my kids. These aren’t productivity hacks. They’re sanity savers.
Because underneath the frameworks and sprint goals, we’re just part of something bigger—organic, changing, deeply human.
The atoms in our bodies? They were once stars. Literally.
We are nature. And like nature, we’re not meant to scale infinitely.
So here’s a quiet question I’m sitting with—and maybe you should, too:
🔍 Is your pursuit of “more” giving you peace—or quietly taking it away?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[📍 Problem description
You have two applications:
App 1 → deployed on Server A, port 80
App 2 → deployed on Server B, port 80
When you try to configure both behind SafeLine WAF, you get the error:
Duplicate applications detected on port 80: *


The reason for this error is:
SafeLine allows only one listener on port 80 on the frontend.
⸻


  
  
  ✅ How to solve it


Since SafeLine currently does not support path-based routing, the only supported solution is domain-based routing.
⸻


  
  
  Use different domain names (recommended)


For example:
App 1 → app1.example.com → Server A:80
App 2 → app2.example.com → Server B:80
In SafeLine:
Configure one listener on port 80
Set routing rules based on the Host header (domain name) to forward traffic to the correct backend server.
This way, SafeLine knows exactly which application the request is meant for.
⸻


  
  
  ⚠️ Why you can’t use multiple port 80 listeners or path-based routing



SafeLine can only bind to port 80 once on the frontend.
Multiple port 80 listeners will always result in a duplicate port error.
Path-based routing (/app1, /app2) is currently not supported in SafeLine.
⸻

🚀 Summary recommendation
✅ Use different domain names and set up Host-based routing in SafeLine.
⸻

{"Games": {"key1": "value1", "key2": value2,"key3":value3}}

Now we need to transform the lower layer into a set of multiple layers.
{"Games":{"AllGames":[{"key1":["value1"]},{"key2":["value2"]},{"key3":["value3"]}]}}

SQL itself does not support multi-layer data, making it more difficult to express multi-layer sets, and the indirectly implemented code is very complex. SPL naturally supports multi-layer data and multi-layer sets:
Try.DEMO


A2: Take the lower-layer data (one record), change the type to a set of records, and then transpose it to a two-layer sequence. […] represents a set, function E can convert a set of records into a two-dimensional sequence, and @ p represents transposition during conversion.


new(new(…:AllGames):Games) Add two layers of record types on top of a multi-layer set to construct the target table sequence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to the final part of our SafeLine WAF series!
So far, you have set up SafeLine and configured it for your environment. Now, it’s time to test your protection, finalize your Docker installation if necessary, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. This will help you maintain a robust and reliable WAF deployment.
You can test the protection effectiveness either manually or automatically.
Access your website using the parameters configured in SafeLine WAF:
Open your browser and visit:
http://<IP or domain>:<port>/

The default protocol is HTTP; check the SSL option to use HTTPS.
The hostname can be either the SafeLine IP or your website domain (make sure the domain resolves to SafeLine).
The port is the one you configured in SafeLine for the site.
If your website is not accessible, please refer to the Configuration Issues section.

Try these URLs to simulate attacks and confirm SafeLine blocks them:
SQL Injection:
http://<IP or domain>:<port>/?id=1%20AND%201=1

XSS Attack:
http://<IP or domain>:<port>/?html=<script>alert(1)</script>



If SafeLine blocks these, you’ll see the attack prevented in your browser and logged in the dashboard. ✅

sudo yum update

If you get errors like “Could not resolve host” or mirrorlist failures, add Alibaba Cloud repo:
curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo http://mirrors.aliyun.com/repo/Centos-7.repo

sudo yum install -y yum-utils

sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo http://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

sudo yum -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

sudo systemctl start docker

If you get x509 certificate errors when pulling images, it’s likely a system time or certificate issue.
Check your system time:
date

If it’s wrong, sync time with:
sudo yum -y install ntpdate

sudo ntpdate cn.pool.ntp.org]]></summary>

The Hello World Container
Docker offers a lightweight "hello-world" image specifically designed to test Docker installations. This minimal container confirms that:
• The Docker client can connect to the Docker daemon.
1.Let's run this test container with the following command:
docker run hello-world


• Check if the hello-world image exists locally
This message confirms that your Docker installation is working correctly.
After running the hello-world container, let's check the list of containers on your system. The container we just ran has already exited, but we can still see it in the list of all containers.
2.To see all containers (including stopped ones), run:
docker ps -a


The -a flag shows all containers, including those that have stopped. Without this flag, docker ps would only show running containers.
STATUS column shows "Exited (0)", which means the container completed its task and exited with a status code of 0 (indicating success).
The hello-world image was downloaded to your local machine. Let's verify this by listing all Docker images:




docker images


This confirms that the hello-world image is stored locally on your system.

When developing a camera app in Swift, you may encounter issues with the startRecording function, such as lagging or crashing. These problems can result from various factors related to resource management, threading, and memory. In this article, we will explore why these issues might occur and how to effectively resolve them.
Understanding the Problem
The primary issue you are facing when pressing the record button is the lag followed by a crash. This occurs because the camera app attempts to perform heavy processing operations on the main thread, leading to unresponsiveness. Furthermore, the crash arises from improper handling of the GPU resources, resulting in a NSInternalInconsistencyException message about framebuffer overreleasing.…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Despite the $1.4 billion lost in the recent Bybit hack, crypto companies have not changed their approach to cybersecurity, according to Hacken CEO Dyma Budorin. 
In an interview with Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event in Dubai, Budorin said the industry continues to rely on limited measures such as bug bounties and penetration tests, rather than implementing comprehensive, layered security strategies:
“Most of the projects think, ‘Okay, we did pentests. That’s enough. Maybe bug bounty. That’s enough.’ It’s not enough.”
He said that crypto companies must go beyond these isolated security measures and adopt more layered approaches similar to those of traditional industries. These include supply-chain security, operational security and blockchain-specific security assessments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's fast-paced tech world, speed matters. But quality matters even more. No one wants to launch a product full of bugs or deliver a user experience that doesn't live up to expectations. That's where quality assurance (QA) comes in - not as a final check, but as an ongoing, strategic process that ensures everything runs smoothly from the start.
One of the biggest mistakes companies make is putting off QA until later. By then, fixing issues becomes expensive and time-consuming. A robust QA process starts right from the planning stage.
QA shouldn't be an island. Developers, designers, project managers, and QA engineers should work as a team. Communication is key. Clear documentation, shared expectations, and open feedback loops help avoid misunderstandings and missed bugs.
You can't fix what you don't track. That's why a well-defined test plan is essential. It sets expectations, outlines goals, and defines what success looks like.
Manual testing has its place, especially when it comes to exploratory testing or checking visual and UX elements. But automation is the backbone of a scalable QA process.
Smoke tests
Regression tests
API testing
Cross-browser checks
Tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright can help speed up the process. Don't overdo it with automation, though - maintaining flaky tests can slow down your team more than it helps.
Pro tip: CI/CD integration
Hook automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline. That way, every time new code is pushed out, it's tested instantly. Faster feedback = fewer issues in production.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omit and Pick are some of the most loved utility types in TypeScript. They let you create new types by excluding or selecting specific properties from an existing type.
union types, their behavior can be misleading - and in some cases, break your type expectations
type Employee = {
 id: string
 name: string
 job_name: string
}
type Customer = {
 id: string
 name: string
 company: string
}
type Person = Employee | Customer

❌ Problem: Using Omit Directly
type PersonWithoutId = Omit<Person, 'id'>

🧨 Actual Result:
type PersonWithoutId = {
 name: string
}

Only name survives. The fields job_name and company are lost.
Why?
not distributive over union types. It collapses the union into a common structure, then removes the property - resulting in a simplified, lossy type.
✅ Solution:
DistributiveOmit
We can fix this by explicitly distributing Omit across each union member:
type DistributiveOmit<T, K extends PropertyKey> = T extends any
 ? Omit<T, K>
 : never

type PersonWithoutId = DistributiveOmit<Person, 'id'>

✅ Expected Result:
type PersonWithoutId =
 | { name: string; job_name: string }
 | { name: string; company: string }

🧪 Same Fix for Pick
type DistributivePick<T, K extends keyof T> = T extends any
 ? Pick<T, K>
 : never

type BasicaPerson = DistributivePick<Person, 'id' | 'name'>

In modern web development, automating tasks can save time and reduce errors. If you're looking to dynamically import all images from a specific folder in a JavaScript project, especially in frameworks like Vue.js, you're in the right place! This article delves into how to facilitate the automatic import of images using the require.context method.
Why This Issue Occurs
When you're dealing with a large number of images, maintaining and updating the image list in your code can become tedious. Manually adding image paths defeats the purpose of efficiency and can lead to mistakes. This need for automation becomes especially apparent when working with dynamically loaded content, where images are regularly updated. Thus, using require.context can simplify the process, allowing you to…]]></summary>

CI/CD stands for:
Continuous Integration (CI) – Automating the build and test process every time code is committed.
Continuous Delivery (CD) – Automating the release of that tested code to staging or production.
In simple terms:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s be honest - managing database changes can sometimes feel like juggling fire. You’ve got multiple developers making updates, environments to manage, rollbacks to worry about, and let’s not forget those late-night “It worked on dev!” surprises.
But guess what? There's a tool that can help you stay ahead of the chaos. It’s called Liquibase, and it's like having a helpful assistant who always remembers what changes were made, who made them, and when. Today, we're going to break it down - what Liquibase is, how it works (especially with YAML), why it's useful, and how it's being used in real projects like mux-sql.
So grab your favourite cup of coffee ☕️, and let’s dive in!
Liquibase is an open-source database change management tool. Think of it as version control, but for your database.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the smoldering forges of Old Valyria, where data flows like wildfire and downtime is the true enemy, there sits a sovereign of steel and silicon—the MSP40. Forged in the fires of precision and armored against chaos, this managed Ethernet switch defends the Seven Realms of Industry 4.0 with the ruthlessness of Tywin Lannister and the foresight of Bran the Broken. Let us declare why this switch claims the Iron Throne of industrial IoT.

Chapter 1: The Forge of Dragonstone
MSP40 is no mere ironborn gadget. Tempered in the Foundries of Valyrian Steel, it wields powers unseen since the Age of Heroes:
Dragonflame Resilience: Operates from -40°C to +85°C—hotter than Drogon’s breath, colder than the Night King’s touch.
Why it shatters the old order:
Legacy Switches: As reliable as Joffrey’s promises—crumbling under pressure.
Chapter 2: The War of Five Ports
The Battle of Blackwater Bay (Smart Factories):
MSP40 commands robotic arms with the precision of Arya’s Needle, slashing downtime like Lannister soldiers. “Chaos isn’t a pit. It’s a 40% productivity gain,” it whispers.
The Siege of Winterfell (Power Grids):
Guards substations against EMP storms, steadfast as Brienne’s oath. “The North remembers… surge protection.”
The Red Wedding (Traffic Systems):
Halts data collisions at smart intersections, sparing cities from King’s Landing-level gridlock. “The network sends its regards.”

The Words of House MSP40
Ports: 12 channels of fury—8 RJ45 knights and 4 SFP dragons.
The Dragons of Innovation
The Dark Threats Beyond the Wall
Legacy Switches: Bloat like Robert Baratheon’s reign, guzzling budgets and sanity.
The Prophecy of the Prince That Was Plugged In
Epilogue: Winter is Here (And It’s Buffering)
the MSP40 is to court chaos—a realm of molten slag and screaming CFOs. The night is dark and full of packet loss.

Movement Labs made the announcement in a May 7 X post, stating it had “terminated Rushi Manche.” The project said it “will continue under a different leadership.” The post also alludes to upcoming governance changes.
The termination follows Movement Labs announcing Manche’s suspension earlier this month, explaining that the “decision was made in light of ongoing events.” It also comes after Coinbase’s recent decision to suspend the Movement Network (MOVE) token, citing its failure to meet its listing standards.

The practice of tracking and managing changes to datasets through time receives insufficient attention despite the focus on selecting the correct algorithms and adjusting hyperparameters. Data versioning practice is a critical management system that succeeds or fails an entire ML project.
Reproducibility and Traceability
Machine learning functions best when researchers maintain the ability to reproduce their outcomes. Model result reproducibility transforms into a random guessing process when you fail to version your data. When you retrain your model, it should deliver uniform results after each dataset variation.

However, you may notice that the compiler output doesn’t display all the messages you expect, and it seems like Scala is deduplicating these messages, even when they are unique.
Understanding the Issue
The issue arises from the way Scala's compiler optimization handles logging messages. When using quotes.reflect.report.info, the compiler may decide to suppress logging information that it considers duplicate. This can lead to frustration, especially when you rely on descriptive debugging information to trace issues within your macros or templates.

When printing web pages, different browsers behave differently and utilize media queries in varying ways. You may have encountered a situation where your stylesheets work beautifully in Internet Explorer, applying the desired styles while printing, but you face challenges in Google Chrome. This can be frustrating, especially if your layout includes essential modifications like removing headers and footers to create a more print-friendly output. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind these inconsistencies and present effective solutions to ensure your print styles are applied correctly in Chrome.

Blockchain security firm CertiK said in a May 6 post to X that the 100 Ether (ETH), worth $182,783 at current prices, was moved from a different address initially used in the exploit but can be traced back to the hacker.  
In March 2022, the exploiter took advantage of a “built-in callback function” in the ERC677 token standard and allowed them to drain the platform’s lending pool through a reentrancy attack, according to CertiK.

Large Bitcoin holders have accumulated 81,338 BTC over the past six weeks, showing confidence in a future price uptrend.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.
The contrasting behavior between Bitcoin (BTC) whales and retail investors often signals that Bitcoin may be heading toward another upward trend, Santiment said in a May 6 X post.

If you haven't seen the movie, here's the gist: Remy is an incredible chef with all the know-how, but he's a rat, so no kitchen access. Linguini is a kitchen worker with full access but little cooking skill. Together, they form a symbiotic relationship: Remy hides under Linguini's hat and guides him on what tools to use and when. 
If a customer orders fries, Linguini might freeze, but Remy scopes out the kitchen, sees what's available, and gives step-by-step instructions: 
"Grab a knife and a cutting board. Now slice the potato." 
Then, Linguini executes the plan.
Agentic systems work similarly. You have three core components:

Are you working with multiple instances of TaskListView in your SwiftUI application and encountering a challenge with task state synchronization? If marking a task as complete or incomplete in one instance doesn’t reflect in another dynamically, you’re not alone. This article discusses how to maintain synchronized state across instances of TaskListView, enhancing your SwiftUI app's user experience.
Understanding the Problem
When you have multiple instances of TaskListView, it’s essential to ensure that they can communicate with each other and reflect the same state changes in real-time. The common approach is to maintain a centralized state that allows both instances to read from and write to the same source. This is particularly crucial in applications where real-time data up…]]></summary>

There are 4 main types of hosting, depending on your needs, budget, and technical skills:
What it is: Multiple websites share the same server and resources.
Best for: Beginners, small websites, blogs.
Pros: Cheap, easy to use.
Cons: Limited performance, less control, security risk from other users.
Examples: Hostinger, Bluehost, GoDaddy, Namecheap
What it is: A physical server divided into virtual servers. You get dedicated resources.
Best for: Developers, small-to-medium apps, testing environments.
Pros: More control, better performance than shared.
Cons: Needs basic sysadmin knowledge (SSH, Linux, Docker).
Examples: DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzner, Vultr
What it is: You get the whole physical server just for your app.
Best for: Large apps, enterprise workloads, high-traffic systems.
Pros: Full control, top performance.
Cons: Expensive, requires advanced knowledge to manage.
Examples: OVH, Liquid Web, IBM Cloud Bare Metal
What it is: On-demand infrastructure with autoscaling, storage, and other services.
Best for: Scalable apps, modern deployments, CI/CD workflows.
Pros: Scales easily, pay-as-you-go, supports containers/microservices.
Cons: Learning curve, can be costly over time if not optimized.
Examples:
Cloud providers: AWS (EC2, ECS, Lightsail), Azure, Google Cloud
PaaS: Render, Railway, Heroku, Vercel (frontend), Netlify (frontend)
Some hosts specialize in Docker/Kubernetes:
For Docker Compose: VPS (DigitalOcean, Hetzner)
For Kubernetes: AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE, or K3s on your VPS

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Implementing a JavaScript plugin system using Rust with Deno can be an exciting challenge. This guide explores how to set up such a system that can integrate JavaScript execution alongside Rust's efficiency while leveraging Deno's secure permission model and web APIs.
Understanding Deno and its Permission Model
Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that offers robust security through permissions. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser-controlled environment with controls over which files and network access is available. This makes it an ideal candidate for implementing a plugin system where different scripts can be executed with varying levels of control.
Setting Up Your Rust Project with Deno
To get started, you need to create a new Rust project.…]]></summary>

*My post explains variable assignment in Python.
You can unpack the iterable which has zero or more values to one or more variables as shown below:
*The number of variables must match the number of values unless a variable uses *.
v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1, 2]

v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1]
# ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)

v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1, 2, 3]
# ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)

*The one or more values with one or more commas(,) are a tuple.
v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1, 2]
v1, v2, v3 = range(0, 3)
v1, v2, v3 = 0, 1, 2 # Tuple
v1, v2, v3 = (0, 1, 2)

print(v1, v2, v3) # 0 1 2

*By default, only keys are assigned to variables from a dictrionary same as using keys().
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}.keys()

print(v1, v2, v3) # name age gender

*values() can get only the values from a dictionary.
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}.values()

print(v1, v2, v3) # John 36 Male

*items() can get both the keys and values from a dictionary.
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}.items()

print(v1, v2, v3)
# ('name', 'John') ('age', 36) ('gender', 'Male')

print(v1[0], v1[1], v2[0], v2[1], v3[0], v3[1])

Vendor lock-in refers to a situation where an organization becomes overly dependent on a specific vendor's products or services, making switching to alternatives costly, time-consuming, or technically difficult. Over the years, many companies have experienced frustration when trying to move away from large vendors like IBM, Microsoft, or Oracle due to contractual constraints, proprietary technologies, and sudden pricing changes. A recent example is VMware's acquisition by Broadcom, followed by significant pricing changes that disrupted many businesses.

If you’ve ever encountered the no main manifest attribute error while trying to run a JAR file in Java, you’re not alone. This common issue arises when the JAR file lacks the necessary metadata to specify the entry point of your application. This article will guide you through understanding this error, configuring your pom.xml file correctly, and successfully packaging your Java application into a runnable JAR file.
Understanding the Error
When you package a Java application into a JAR file, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) looks for a specific entry in the JAR's manifest file to understand where the main class is located. If this entry is missing, Java throws the no main manifest attribute error. This typically happens when the maven-jar-plugin isn't correctly configured in…]]></summary>

The Python code style guide is not set in stone. It evolves continuously with the development of the language. Some old conventions are gradually phased out, and new ones keep emerging. At the same time, many projects have their own coding style guides. When there are conflicts, the project-specific guides should be followed first. However, there is an important principle to keep in mind: "The stupid persistence in consistency is the monster of ignorance", which is a profound insight from Guido. Since code is often read more frequently than it is written, the core goal of the style guide is to improve code readability and keep all kinds of Python code consistent. As PEP20 says, "Readability counts".

With over 99% of votes in favor of the proposal already, the airdrop will distribute a small amount of USD1 to eligible holders of the WLFI token, according to the May 6 proposal in the WLFI governance forum.
“Testing the airdrop mechanism in a live setting is a necessary step to ensure smart contract functionality and readiness. This distribution also serves as a meaningful way to thank our earliest supporters and introduce them to USD1,” the proposal states.

But modern CSS offers something better — the power of clamp().
Still, using clamp() across different layout properties (like spacing, widths, typography) isn't always intuitive.
So let’s simplify it.
clamp()?


Here’s what the right tool can help you with:
✅ Boost productivity

✅ Cut down on trial-and-error

✅ Write cleaner, scalable CSS

✅ Build fluid layouts with fewer breakpoints

✅ Preview and optimize shorthand styles (padding, margin, etc.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I need to find a suitable foundational library for video processing. FFMpegCore works for one-shot things but despite a fluent API, its interface is still too command line like.
Here is what I found out:




OpenCvSharp
LibVLCSharp
FFMediaToolkit




Frames
✅ decode / encode
✅ (via callbacks)
❓


Audio
❌
✅ decode / encode / mux
❓


Extra libs
~5 MB/platform
+7 MB
+7 MB


Licence
Apache‑2.0
LGPLv2.1
MIT


Platforms
Win / mac / Linux / Arm
Win / mac / Linux / iOS / Android
Win / mac / Linux



LibVLCSharp seems more focused on directly displaying things (e.g. in Xamarine and WPF) instead of low-level API based processing; FFMediaToolkit, on the other hand, still depends on FFMPEG and can't avoid licensing issue. Eventually, I had to go with separate video + audio processing in favor of OpenCvSharp (it's Apache-2.0 by the way).
Notice OpenCVSharp has some advantage over EmguCV for custom dev:




OpenCvSharp
Emgu.CV




Licence
Apache-2.0 (fully permissive)
GPL v3 or commercial licence


Interop model
Pure P/Invoke (no C++/CLI), works on any .NET core runtime
Historically C++/CLI wrapper (needs Windows for full feature set), .NET Standard P/Invoke layer added later



NuGet size (native)
4–6 MB per RID (modular runtime packages)
30 MB + for the “opencv‑world” monolith, or 90 MB for emgucv‑runtime‑ubuntu



GPU (CUDA) support
Provided in separate OpenCvSharp4.runtime.dnn package
Official CUDA builds, but Windows‑only binaries unless you compile yourself


API surface
~1:1 with OpenCV C++ names (easy to port C++ samples)
Thicker .NET façade (e.g. Image<Bgr, byte> types), extra helpers


Cross‑platform stability
Actively tested on Windows / Linux / macOS / arm64
Windows the main focus; Linux/macOS possible with libopencv from distro or big runtime package


Learning curve
If you know OpenCV C++ you feel at home
Higher‑level abstractions can be friendlier for newcomers


Commercial support
Community‑driven
Paid licences & support available from Emgu CV, Inc.]]></summary>

Understanding memory allocation in Rust, especially heap allocation, is crucial for writing efficient and safe programs. A common point of confusion arises when working with stack and heap memory, as illustrated by discussions in the Rust community. There has been notable inquiry surrounding issues like stack overflow errors, which are often linked to how Rust manages memory. In this article, we will explore how Rust handles heap allocation and clarify why it behaves the way it does.
What is Heap Allocation in Rust?
Heap allocation in Rust occurs when we need to allocate memory dynamically, which is often necessary for larger data that cannot fit on the stack. The Rust programming language helps manage memory through a system of ownership, borrowing, and its smart pointers lik…]]></summary>

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun livestream.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building components in Ruby using the Phlex library, developers often want the flexibility to use yield multiple times within a single component. The question arises: “Is it possible for a Phlex component to yield more than once?” In this blog post, we will explore this concept, the workings of the Phlex library, and provide a solution to achieve the desired functionality without modifying the method signatures.
Understanding Phlex Components
Phlex is a powerful library for creating HTML components in Ruby. It allows developers to craft reusable components easily while leveraging the power of Ruby's block syntax. The yield statement in Ruby is often used to pass control from a method back to a block that is supplied at the point of the method call.

Sure, we’ve moved beyond FTP dumps and cron jobs—hopefully. But even now, in 2025, it’s shocking how often integration is an afterthought. We default to old habits: point-to-point connections, fragile middleware setups, and hand-rolled glue code. It feels productive… until everything breaks.
If you’ve ever untangled a mess of connectors, patched together five tools to talk to each other, or babysat a brittle pipeline at 2 a.m.—you know what I mean.
The Problem Isn’t That We Don’t Care—It’s That We Start in the Wrong Place

I often randomly test the hyperlinks and they all worked, but I just realize that I only test the longest hyperlinks, because I think they are the ones more prone to hallucinations. I didn't find any hallucinations.
But yesterday I clicked some of the simpler links of r/Conservative summaries and I got 30% of them not working. I panicked because I thought the hallucination caught me off guard, but then I realized all the links were real, but they each got an additional ";" attached to them, which was redundant.
The links themselves were correct but the semicolons I used to declare the end of line was wrongly identified as part of the URLs. The fix was simple. I removed all redundant semicolons from all my current and previous output documents.
I am really surprised of this bug because it affected so many links but it evaded my "random" sampling for so long, because I didn't test the rendered URL links very thoroughly, and I thought very long and complex links were at higher risks of hallucination, so I tested those a lot. Weird enough, those never had problems, but the shorter, simpler links did. I am very sorry for the potential confusion it might have created.]]></summary>

Foreground services allow your application to perform long-running operations while the user is aware of what it is doing. These services are typically used for tasks that need to keep running even if the app is not actively in foreground.

Today, we live in a world of microservices, APIs, and distributed everything. The architecture is elegant. The orchestration is powerful. But testing? That’s where things get tricky.
As a quality engineering leader, I’ve seen firsthand how this complexity tests more than just code—it tests our assumptions about ownership, accountability, and what “done” really means.
In a microservices ecosystem, a single user journey might hit a dozen services. Each is built, deployed, and owned by a different team. And while unit tests may pass with flying colors, it’s the integration points—those fragile handshakes between services—that often…]]></summary>

In Java, managing complex key structures dynamically is a common challenge, especially when dealing with API response times and performance issues. In your scenario, you're saving keys in a map formatted like Krishna/thota/date/x/y/z while supporting wildcard characters (*) to match various entries. However, this approach leads to performance overhead due to the necessity of comparing strings, which can be inefficient when handling over a million records. We’ll explore better data structures and solutions to enhance performance while allowing for the flexibility you need for matching.
Understanding the Performance Issue

Yet, as those early fans grew alongside the medium itself, uncomplicated childhood memories gave way to reflective curiosity. With maturity comes the realisation that even playful narratives can unwittingly reveal complex truths—sometimes challenging, always intriguing.
Among Spyro's cast, no group invites this reconsideration quite like the Gnorcs. Originally depicted as brutish, green-skinned adversaries to vanquish without second thought, today they stir conversation far beyond simple nostalgia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most teams spend hours documenting everything.
Notion workspaces. Confluence pages. GitHub wikis. You name it.
But here’s what happens:
☑️New hires still get stuck.  ☑️Devs still ask questions that are, “Somewhere in the docs” and crucial context gets lost.
This is the Documentation Paradox: The more you write, the harder it gets to find, trust, and maintain what actually matters.
Conventional wisdom says, “Async teams need tons of docs!”
But I’ll say: More docs often mean less clarity.
Here’s why:
First, there's the maintenance burden.
Every line of documentation is a liability that needs updating as your codebase evolves.
How many teams actually do that?
Second, comprehensive documentation creates a false sense of security.
Teams believe they're covered because it's in the docs somewhere.
What you should do is treat documentation as a conversation, not an artifact.
Use tools that make updating docs as easy as sending a message.
Encourage annotations and questions directly in the documentation.
And remember the 20/80 rule: 20% of your features generate 80% of questions. Focus your efforts there.
The goal isn't to have everything documented – it's to have the right documentation that actually helps your team move faster.
This is why every Rally session lives forever inside Jira
No more sorting through old Slack threads.
Every discussion stays tied to the task, so your team’s knowledge grows with the work—not in a dusty folder.]]></summary>

In this article, we'll explore how to convert strings while following the two scenarios provided in your request: changing capitalization and formatting string cases to appear more human-friendly.
Understanding the Humanization Process
When we discuss 'humanizing' a string, we're typically referring to text transformation that makes it easier for humans to read or understand. This can involve adjusting capitalization, changing the case, or formatting text to look more polished and readable. Unlike Ruby, where the humanize function applies well-defined transformations, C# requires us to craft our own methods.

When working with Rust and Diesel, you may encounter various issues, especially when performing count queries. In this article, we'll examine a specific error that arises from executing a count query using Diesel with PostgreSQL. The error message states, 'the trait bound i32: FromSql<BigInt, Pg> is not satisfied'. This indicates a type mismatch in your query resolution.
Understanding the Error
The error is primarily triggered because the Diesel ORM expects a specific data type from the SQL count result. Typically, when using the count function in a SQL query, the result is of type BigInt in PostgreSQL, which corresponds to i64 in Rust. However, your code attempts to return the result as an i32, leading to the compile error.

Why is This Query Problematic?

Las capas de cascada (cascade layers) en CSS han sido introducidas para resolver uno de los problemas más complejos y persistentes en la escritura de estilos: los conflictos de especificidad. En este artículo exploraremos cuál es exactamente ese problema y cómo la regla @layer nos ofrece una solución eficaz y moderna.
La regla @layer permite declarar estas capas de cascada, que funcionan de forma análoga a las capas en editores gráficos como Photoshop o GIMP: cada capa es un grupo independiente, pero en lugar de imágenes, gestionamos reglas CSS.
El objetivo principal es claro:
Organizar mejor el código.


Evitar los problemas clásicos de especificidad.


Reducir la necesidad de usar !important o sobreescribir selectores complejos.

A aplicação guarda o endereço em memória e não o valor em si. Importantes casos são as arrays e os objetos. Exemplos Arrays, Objetos, Classes, String.
Os tipos primitivos são predefinidos (já definidos) em Java. Tipos não primitivos são criados pelo programador e não são definidos.
Tipos não primitivos podem ser usados para chamar métodos para realizar determinadas operações, enquanto tipos primitivos não podem.
Um tipo primitivo sempre tem um valor, enquanto os tipos não primitivos podem ser null.
Um tipo primitivo começa com uma letra minúscula, enquanto os tipos não primitivos começam com uma letra maiúscula.

In this article, we will talk about a rather unusual topic, information about which for some reason I did not find, although it is quite useful in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries for creating user interfaces, because, in some cases, applying the concept can help speed up work with the DOM several times.
The name is conditional, but the essence is important.
The term "usual state" refers to data that is saved directly due to the state managers, or due to the internal functionality of the framework or library. An example of the state in Vue.js:
createApp({
  setup() {
    return {
      count:ref(0);
    };
  },
  template: `<div>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is seeking permission from the court to drop an appeal against prediction market Kalshi. The move could allow the platform to offer political event contracts to users without contest.
In a May 5 filing in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for the CFTC filed an unopposed motion for voluntary dismissal, suggesting an agreement with Kalshi. The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.
Motion to dismiss appeal filed by the CFTC on May 5. Source: Courtlistener

  Demystifying HTTP for Web Developers, Part 2



In Part 1 of this series, we traced the full journey of an HTTP request — from typing a URL in the browser, through DNS resolution and TCP handshakes, all the way to receiving the server’s response. But understanding the path a request travels is only half the story. To truly master HTTP, we now need to dissect the payload that actually moves across the wire: the HTTP request itself.
Every interaction between a web client and a server begins with a carefully structured message — the request. It may look simple on the surface, but every line, header, and byte in that request carries meaning. If you’re building serious web applications, APIs, or even debugging flaky integrations, you can’t a…]]></summary>

Incorporating an MP3 audio player into a PHP script is a great way to enhance user experience on your website. Capturing playback time is particularly useful for tracking how long users engage with audio content. This article will guide you through the process of capturing the current playback value from an audio player implemented with HTML and integrating it into your PHP backend.
Understanding the Issue
You may be using an audio player in your PHP application and want to log how long the audio has been played by the user. This task usually involves a communication between the frontend (JavaScript) and the backend (PHP).

Ever doomscroll your way into developer rage? Yeah, me too.
So yesterday I was minding my own business (aka avoiding Jira) when I stumbled upon a blog where some dude proudly declared:
“Just finished 100 Days CSS Challenge!! 🥳🔥💯”
Cool flex, bro. But when I clicked in, expecting juicy breakdowns, clever hacks, or at least some trauma bonding... all I got was:
copy-paste StackOverflow energy, and I felt like I’d just been catfished by a portfolio piece.
So naturally, I did what any mentally unwell developer would do — I challenged myself to do 100 Days CSS in 10 Days.
Because why suffer slowly when you can suffer FAST?

When developing an iOS application using Flutter, you might come across the need to obfuscate your Dart code. Obfuscation can help protect your code from reverse engineering, making your app more secure. In this article, we'll address how to properly configure the extra_gen_snapshot_options_or_none flag in your Flutter project, particularly focusing on the iOS setup.
Why Obfuscate Dart Code?
Obfuscation of Dart code increases the protection of your intellectual property by making the source code harder to read and understand. This is especially crucial for apps that might handle sensitive data or proprietary algorithms. As Flutter's official documentation suggests, adding the right flags during the build process is vital.

The concerns about performance are valid; loading too many files can slow down your website significantly. So, can you simply combine all your CSS selectors into one general file? Let’s dive into this topic and explore the best approach to optimize your WordPress site.
Why Too Many CSS Files Can Slow Down Your Website
Having multiple CSS files means that the browser has to make many requests to the server to load all those stylesheets. Each request adds latency, which impacts your page load speed. From an SEO perspective, page speed is crucial as it affects user experience and, consequently, your search engine ranking. Thus, it’s essential to eliminate excess CSS files.

While the consensus points to no change in interest rates, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins could see gains if the US Treasury is compelled to inject liquidity to stave off an economic recession.

At least in my experiment, Codestral's performance is, frankly, disappointing. While it produces code that follows a certain architecture, the code quality is low. In fact, it even generates a statement of the form a = foo() where a has a different type from what foo() returns. Read on for more details.

Stay with TypeScript if:



You're web-focused (Angular/React)
Your team knows TS well
You need Node.js compatibility
Choose Dart if:



Cross-platform is your goal
Dev productivity is crucial
You want single-codebase apps
Pro Tip:

Try Dart for your next internal tool before committing to big projects.
Not for web apps, but it's leading for mobile/desktop.
No, but Flutter Web is now production-ready.
Focused on WASM, not competing with Dart.
Server-side (though improving).

As artificial intelligence (AI) grows smarter, cybercriminals are weaponizing it to launch sneaky, personalized phishing attacks. But here’s the big question: Can these AI tricks fool even cybersecurity pros? Let’s break it down.
What Makes AI-Powered Phishing Different?

Hover effects are a popular way to enhance user experience on websites, allowing crucial information to be revealed contextually. If you want to display a hidden description when a user hovers over an image, you are in the right place. In this article, we’ll cover how to effectively show a hidden description using CSS, addressing common issues you may encounter along the way.
Understanding the Issue
It can be frustrating to see that your hidden description is not appearing as expected when hovering over an image. This often happens due to incorrect CSS properties, improper HTML structure, or because of conflicts with JavaScript functionalities you may have implemented. The CSS code provided in the query seems close to the solution but needs a few adjustments.

Data shows Bitcoin bulls opening margin long positions from $94,400.

A $189 million increase in Bitcoin futures open interest and a 15% increase in trading volume show sustained buying interest.

BTC momentum tends to slow before FOMC meetings and then turns volatile afterward. The same could happen following this week’s Federal Reserve statements.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market. A similar cluster was observed at the end of April, which pushed BTC prices to $97,500.

In today's digital age, the financial world is undergoing a significant transformation. One of the most groundbreaking developments is asset tokenization, which involves converting real-world assets like real estate, stocks, or commodities into digital tokens on a blockchain. This process offers numerous benefits, including increased liquidity, faster transactions, and broader access to investment opportunities.
However, with these advancements come challenges, particularly in ensuring that these digital transactions comply with existing laws and regulations. This is where smart contracts come into play.

However, while cloud computing brings speed and flexibility, managing cloud costs can often feel like a challenge. This is where understanding the benefits of cloud TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) becomes crucial. 
Cloud TCO, or Total Cost of Ownership in the cloud, refers to the complete financial estimate of running cloud infrastructure over time. It doesn't just include your monthly cloud bill but also covers hidden costs like software licenses, data transfers, storage, maintenance, labor, and downtime.

The need to pivot object keys arises when you have a table with a column storing semi-structured data types like objects. In our case, we have a table objects_to_pivot where the attributes column contains various object keys that might not be consistent across rows.

EventTarget is the foundation of the browser’s event system.
addEventListener, removeEventListener, and dispatchEvent.
Many core Web APIs including DOM elements like <button>, <div>, <input>, as well as document and window inherit from EventTarget.

When we attach an event handler to a DOM element—like in the picture above—we’re actually subscribing to that element through one of its event channels.
In this case:
The button is the publisher (or emitter)
The callback function passed to addEventListener is the subscriber (or listener)
So when a user clicks the button, the button emits a 'click' event, and all registered listeners for that event type are notified and executed.

O Decorator é um padrão de projeto estrutural que permite adicionar comportamentos adicionais a um objeto de forma dinâmica.

Isso possibilita adicionar ou remover comportamentos com facilidade, mantendo o código mais flexível e desacoplado.
Em resumo, o Decorator cria uma cadeia de responsabilidades onde cada classe pode adicionar sua funcionalidade à sequência, sem afetar as outras.

TypeScript has quickly become a favorite tool for developers building scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications. At its core, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript—it builds upon JavaScript by introducing static typing, as well as other modern programming concepts that make your code safer and easier to manage. Static typing means that developers can explicitly define the types of data (like string, number, or boolean) their variables and functions work with, catching potential errors during development instead of at runtime.

TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript designed to add type safety and developer-friendly features to JavaScript code. A "superset" means that TypeScript builds on JavaScript by adding new functionalities, while still allowing you to write plain JavaScript. One of its most powerful features is the introduction of types (a system to define constraints on the structure of your data). This is immensely beneficial when working in large projects to detect errors at compile time, ensuring your codebase is reliable and maintainable.

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript. This means that it builds on top of JavaScript by adding an optional type system (a way to define and enforce the kinds of data being used in your code). TypeScript is a powerful language designed to catch errors early during development, making your JavaScript codebases more robust and maintainable.
In TypeScript, "types" play a central role. A type defines the shape of data, specifying what kind of data will be stored, its expected structure, and the operations you can perform on it. For example, string, number, boolean, and object are common types used in TypeScript. Types ensure that your code only operates on the data it was designed to handle; if it doesn’t match t…]]></summary>

In recent years, the world of finance has seen significant advancements, especially with the introduction of blockchain technology. One of the most exciting developments in this space is the concept of tokenization, particularly the tokenization of U.S. equities (stocks). But what exactly does tokenization mean, and why is it so important for U.S. equities? 
What is Tokenization?
Tokenization refers to the process of converting ownership of an asset, such as stocks, real estate, or artwork, into a digital token on a blockchain. This token represents ownership or a portion of ownership of the underlying asset. In the case of U.S. equities, tokenization means turning traditional company shares into digital tokens that are recorded on a blockchain ledger.

I recently launched VidSabio, a platform that transforms ordinary videos into structured, interactive learning experiences — automatically. 🎥➡️📚
But this didn’t come together overnight.
At first, I thought a single LLM could handle everything: analyze the video, transcribe it, generate quizzes, build a course. Easy, right?
Wrong.
It turned out the real breakthrough came when I stopped looking for one model to do it all — and instead built a pipeline of specialized steps, each powered by the best tool for that specific task.
Here’s the high-level breakdown of how it works:
User uploads a video
Video is processed through a multi-step pipeline:
Frame extraction (FFmpeg)
Audio transcription (Google Speech-to-Text)
Visual analysis (Gemini / GPT-4 Vision)
Content summarization + topic generation (Gemini Pro)
Course structure generation (GPT-4)
Interactivity injection (quizzes, accordions, etc.)


Final course can be edited and exported as SCORM or HTML
This is all built using Vue 3, Firebase, and various LLMs (OpenAI + Gemini) stitched together through Cloud Functions.
By distributing the heavy lifting across multiple LLMs and APIs, I was able to:
Improve accuracy
Scale more efficiently
Debug and retry isolated steps
Customize outputs based on step-level feedback
Frontend: Vue 3 + Tailwind
Backend: Firebase Functions + Firestore + Storage
AI: GPT-4.1, Gemini Pro, Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text
Analytics: PostHog
Export: SCORM, HTML
Here's a stylized diagram of the flow:
(Insert your HappyAlien-styled image here)
This was built with plenty of detours, dead ends, and "aha" moments. If you're building with LLMs, I encourage you to explore multi-model orchestration — it might be the key to your next breakthrough.

I just launched a side project I’ve been tinkering with:
GitVisualize
It lets you paste in any public GitHub repo URL, and it’ll generate a visual representation of that project using OpenAI’s gpt-image-1 model — all based on the repo’s README content.
Takes a GitHub repo URL
Pulls the README
Feeds it to an AI image model
Displays the generated image alongside project metadata
Adds it to a public gallery
You can even choose the image style you want:
Conceptual & Techy
Infographic
Abstract & Minimalist
Direct & Clear
It’s built with Vue 3 + Tailwind, uses Supabase for storage and data, and everything runs through a lightweight backend on Render.
I love browsing GitHub, and I wondered:
“What would this project look like if it were a picture?”
So I built GitVisualize as a fun experiment in combining AI, dev culture, and a bit of creativity. Some of the results are surprisingly expressive.
Frontend: Vue 3 + Tailwind
Backend: Node/Express (Render)
AI: OpenAI gpt-image-1


Storage/DB: Supabase
Design direction: Lighthearted “Happy Alien” aesthetic 🛸
➡️ https://gitvisualize-web.onrender.com/
Paste a repo, pick a style, and see what AI dreams up!
I’d love feedback, ideas, or feature suggestions.

Before we dive into coding, let's quickly explore why stream+json exists. Often, you need to send large arrays of JSON via APIs. You could send this large array from the server all at once, but when PHP receives it, PHP loads everything into memory.
While this method works, it can cause issues such as:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways:

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

Not sure if you’re in a bull or bear market? This guide breaks down how to spot the difference using price action, volume, sentiment and onchain data. Learn how to recognize market cycles, what signals to watch for and how to adjust your strategy for each phase so you can trade smarter.
Crypto markets can feel like emotional rollercoasters, prices soaring one month, then crashing the next. You're not alone if you’ve ever wondered whether you are in a bull or a bear market.
In the simplest terms:

A bull market is when prices keep going up, people are excited and there’s a general sense that the future is bright. Think back to late 2020 and early 2021; Bitcoin (BTC) climbed from around $10,000 to nearly $70,000. New projects were launching daily and it felt like everyone from your co…]]></summary>

The investigation was led by Heiner Garcia, a cyber threat intelligence expert at Telefónica and a blockchain security researcher. Garcia uncovered how North Korean operatives secured freelance work online even without using a VPN.
Garcia’s analysis linked the applicant to a network of GitHub accounts and fake Japanese identities believed to be associated with North Korean operations. In February, Garcia invited Cointelegraph to take part in a dummy job interview he had set up with a suspected Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) operative who called himself “Motoki.”…]]></summary>

In this article, we'll explore how to decrypt cookie values retrieved from Google Chrome using C#. If you've stumbled upon encrypted cookies in your code and need a way to decrypt these values effectively, you're in the right place. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the decryption process while using C#.
Understanding the Issue
When accessing cookies stored by Google Chrome, it is common to encounter encrypted values. The cookies are stored in a SQLite database, and the encrypted values can pose a challenge when you need to retrieve the actual data. Chrome uses a specific encryption mechanism that relies on Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) for Windows systems. Therefore, to decrypt the cookies, you must understand this encryption approach.

For instance, if you're using TypeScript and Vue.js, you might receive data in snake_case from an API but prefer to work with camelCase throughout your application. The good news is that you can easily transform this data without losing type safety. Let's delve into how you can achieve that with the help of interfaces and utility types in TypeScript.
Understanding the Problem
When you define an interface such as MergedReviewDetails, you structure your data according to your application's needs. An example of this could be:
export interface MergedReviewDetails {
  parentReview: Mmcid;
  childReviews: Mmcid[];
}

However, the API might return data with properties in snake_ca…]]></summary>

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …]]></summary>

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.
Uncertainty about practical applications
Blockchain offers some big promises: faster settlements, stronger security and better transparency. But actually applying those promises across banking, accounting and operations is still complicated.

Passing parameters from ASP.NET MVC page models to TypeScript functions can be tricky, especially when incorporating dynamic values such as token, url, and redirectUrl. In this guide, we will explore how to accomplish this effectively, ensuring that we maintain optimal coding practices.
Understanding the Basics
When working with TypeScript and ASP.NET MVC, it is crucial to understand how data flows between the server-side (C# code) and client-side (TypeScript/VBScript/JavaScript code). The Link.ts you provided defines an interface LinkConfig and an asynchronous function postData. This function needs to be called with correctly structured parameters that are passed from your Razor pages.

At IBM, I led the transformation of one such platform: the Cognitive Support Platform (CSP). Originally built as a monolithic, Salesforce-native application, it had outgrown its architecture. We rebuilt it from the ground up into a modular, event-driven, cloud-native system infused with AI.
The results were real and measurable:
✅ 70% increase in system availability
✅ 90%+ reduction in AI inference costs
✅ 80% improvement in platform security
✅ 70% boost in developer productivity
In this article, I’ll share the architectural strategies, DevOps patterns, and AI integration principles that made this transformation successful and scalable.

Tailgating, a subtle yet dangerous form of intrusion, happens when an unauthorized person gains access to a restricted area by following closely behind someone who is authorized.

Attackers often masquerade as employees, contractors, or delivery workers. They may carry packages, wear uniforms, or claim to have forgotten their access badge—all to lower suspicion.

In a May 6 joint hearing of the HFSC and House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Waters remained standing while addressing Republican leadership, saying she intended to block proceedings due to Donald Trump’s corruption, “ownership of crypto,” and oversight of government agencies. Digital asset subcommittee chair Bryan Steil, seemingly taking advantage of a loophole in committee rules, said Republican lawmakers would continue with the event as a “roundtable” rather than a hearing.
HFSC Chair French Hill urged lawmakers at the hearing to create a “lasting framework” on digital assets, but did not directly address any of Rep. Waters’ and Democrats’ concerns about Trump’s involvement with the crypto industry. He claimed Waters was making the hearing a partisan issue and shutting down discussion on a digital asset regulatory framework.

Unveiled by OpenAI in late April 2025, it empowers developers and creators to produce, manipulate, and refine visual content through simple text prompts or image inputs. This article dives deep into how GPT-Image‑1 works, exploring its architecture, capabilities, integrations, and the latest developments shaping its adoption and impact.
GPT-Image‑1 is the first dedicated image-centric model in OpenAI’s GPT lineup, released via the OpenAI API as a state‑of‑the‑art image generation system. Unlike specialized models such as DALL·E 2 or DALL·E 3, GPT‑Image‑1 is natively multimodal—it processes both text and im…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It was a regular evening debug session. My code was working, but something about it just felt off. I was looping over a list—like always.
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    value = my_list[i]
    # Do something with value and i

Nothing wrong, right?
Except... I was starting to hate reading my own code.
range(len(...)). Too much manual indexing.
👀 The Realization
for i, value in enumerate(my_list):
    # Do something with i and value

Wait... what?
No range(len(...))? No messy indexing?
✅ Cleaner
🧠 Why it works:
enumerate() is a built-in Python function that returns both the index and the value of items in an iterable—in one shot.
It’s like your loop suddenly gained superpowers.
💡 Bonus Tip:
for i, val in enumerate(my_list, start=1):
    print(f"Item {i}: {val}")

Perfect for user-facing counters. No more +1 hacks.
🚫 Never Again...
No more range(len(...)) unless I really need it.
Now, it’s all enumerate(), all day.
✨ Moral of the Story:
If you're reaching for range(len(...)), stop and ask yourself—
What would enumerate() do? 😎]]></summary>

In your case, you're able to access standard fields like E2 and Es easily:
farfield = getresult("monitor", "farfield");
E2 = farfield.E2;
Es = farfield.Es;

However, when it comes to the field "Ep vs angle", an error arises. This can happen due to the space in the field name, making direct access using dot notation invalid.
Understanding the Structure of the Farfield Object

When working with third-party SDKs that leverage Jetpack Compose, developers can often run into issues that only appear in the final APK. In this article, we will explore a specific case of a NoSuchMethodError that arises during navigation to a Compose-based screen of a third-party SDK. This problem can be particularly frustrating, as it does not occur when running the app straight from Android Studio, but instead manifests when generating a debug APK via the command line.
Understanding the Issue
The problem at hand is encapsulated by the error message:

You see cut-off arrays. Flattened hierarchies. Lost context.

And worst of all? Hidden bugs buried under “pretty” formatting.
That’s why I created SetPrint — a Python library that shows structure, not just values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asynchronous JavaScript can be tricky to grasp, especially for beginners. Concepts like Promises, Async/Await, and the fetch API often seem abstract — until you build something real with them.
In my latest YouTube video, I break down asynchronous JS in the simplest way possible and walk you through how to use it in a real-world project. And what better way to learn than by building something fun… like a Pokémon Fetch App!








  
  
  📌 What You'll Learn


✅ The difference between Promises and Async/Await

✅ How to use try...catch and finally for error handling

✅ Making real API requests with the fetch() method

✅ Applying everything by building a Pokémon project
00:00 – Introduction: What is Asynchronous JavaScript?


01:10 – Promises, Async/Await, try…catch, then…catch…finally


06:30 – API - Fetch


10:39 – Pokémon Project (Hands-on section)
If you're learning frontend development or JavaScript, mastering asynchronous code is non-negotiable. Whether you're handling user interactions, loading data from an API, or building full-stack apps — you need these concepts in your toolkit.
This video blends theory and practice, so you'll understand the "why" and "how" behind the code — not just copy-paste your way through.
In the final part of the video, you'll build a simple app that fetches Pokémon data from a public API. You’ll apply everything you’ve learned and see how it all works together.
Don't just read about async JavaScript — build it.

When working with Svelte and TypeScript, you might run into challenges regarding event typing. A common scenario involves handling input events from an <input> element and wanting to replace the generic any type with a more specific InputEvent. This article will explore how to accurately type the input event in Svelte using TypeScript, allowing you to harness the benefits of type checking while eliminating the use of any.
Understanding the Issue
You are currently using an input handler function that looks like this:
function emitChange(event: any) {
    const text = event.target.value;
    dispatch("changeContent", { text });
}

While this function works, it relies on the any type, which defeats the purpose of using TypeScript. In your attempt to switch to InputEvent, you enco…]]></summary>

If you’ve worked with Rails for any length of time, you’ve probably hit the wall when dealing with time-series data. I know I did. 
Your app starts off smooth—collecting metrics, logging events, tracking usage. But one day, your dashboards start lagging. Page load times creep past 10 seconds. Pagination stops helping. Background jobs queue up as yesterday’s data takes too long to process.
This isn’t a Rails problem. Or even a PostgreSQL problem. It’s a “using the wrong tool for the job” problem.
In this post, I’ll show you…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Functions are the heart of any programming language, and in TypeScript, they become even more powerful with type safety.
In my latest video, I walk you through how to write and use functions in TypeScript. Whether you're transitioning from JavaScript or just getting started with TS, this tutorial is designed to help you build a solid foundation.
📺 Watch the full tutorial on YouTube:









  
  
  🚀 What You'll Learn:


✅ Declaring functions with TypeScript

✅ Arrow functions vs traditional functions

✅ Typing function parameters and return values

✅ Optional and default parameters

✅ Clean code and best practices
JavaScript is flexible — sometimes too flexible. TypeScript introduces structure by enforcing types, reducing bugs and making your code easier to understand and maintain.
With TypeScript, functions can clearly define:
What kind of arguments they accept
What type of result they return
Whether certain parameters are required or optional
Here’s a quick example:
function greet(name: string = "Dev"): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}


`
This function:
Takes a name parameter of type string

Has a default value ("Dev")
Returns a string



And TypeScript will enforce all of that at compile-time!
Real-life function examples
Why arrow functions behave differently (especially with this)
Tips for writing scalable functions in a TypeScript project

This video is part of my ongoing TypeScript series. If you're serious about becoming a better web developer, learning TypeScript is non-negotiable.

React’s component-based architecture pairs seamlessly with Tailwind’s utility-first CSS framework, enabling rapid development without sacrificing quality. This combo shines in large-scale projects where consistency, performance, and maintainability are critical.
Key Benefits:
 Efficiency: Style directly in JSX, eliminating context-switching to separate CSS files.
📱 Responsive Design: Built-in responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) simplify adaptive layouts.
 Reusability: Encourages modular, reusable components for UI and styling.
 Maintainability: Tailwind’s purge feature ensures lean production CSS.
We’ll use Vite for a lightweight, fast build tool and configure Tailwind with a scalable structure.

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index turned negative for the first time in 15 days, indicating defensive short-term sentiment among US investors.

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

Before diving into the solution, it’s crucial to understand the limitations of traditional, manual NiFi flow deployment:
Human Errors: Copy-paste mistakes, missing components, or incorrect parameter settings are common in manual deployments.
Versioning Conflicts: Developers often work on different versions of a data flow, making it difficult to track or reconcile changes.
Environment Mismatches: Development, Staging, and Production environments may have different configurations. Manual NiFi data flow deployment makes it easy to overlook such nuances.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RDMA(Remote Direct Memory Access)는 네트워크를 통해 서버 간에 CPU 개입 없이 메모리를 직접 읽고 쓰는 기술이다. 주로 고성능 컴퓨팅(HPC), 대규모 데이터 처리, AI/ML 분산 학습 환경 등에서 낮은 지연 시간과 높은 대역폭을 제공하기 때문에 많이 사용한다. 
1. RDMA의 기본 개념
일반적인 네트워크 통신 방식에서는 데이터를 전송하려면 CPU가 메모리에서 데이터를 읽고, 네트워크 인터페이스 카드(NIC)로 복사한다. 
이 복사한 데이터를 네트워크를 통해 데이터를 보내고, 수신 측에서도 CPU가 데이터를 NIC에서 메모리로 복사한다. 이 과정에서 CPU, 커널, 복사 작업 등이 개입되어 지연(latency)과 CPU 오버헤드가 큰 현상이 발생한다. 
반면, RDMA는, CPU나 운영체제(OS) 커널의 개입 없이, 원격 시스템의 메모리에 직접 읽기(read) 또는 쓰기(write) 작업을 수행한다. 다시 말해, 데이터가 직접 메모리에서 메모리로 이동한다.
2. RDMA가 동작하는 방식
(1) 메모리 등록 (Memory Registration)
송신자와 수신자 모두 RDMA NIC(HCA: Host Channel Adapter)를 사용함.
RDMA를 사용하기 위해서는 사용할 메모리 영역을 등록(pinning)해야 함. 이 과정에서 해당 메모리는 물리 메모리에 고정되고 커널이 RDMA NIC에 메모리 주소를 알려줌. 
(2) Queue Pair 생성
RDMA 통신은 QP(Queue Pair)라는 구조를 통해 이루어짐. 
QP는 Send Queue와 Receive Queue로 구성…]]></summary>

From a simple calculator app to a complex search engine, how data is stored, managed, and accessed can significantly impact performance. That’s where data structures come in. If you’re new to programming or looking to strengthen your foundation, this Data Structures Tutorial will serve as a beginner’s guide to mastering the basics.

Before diving deeper, it’s important to answer the question: what is data structure? At its simplest, a data structure is a method of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. Think of it like the different types of containers you might use in your kitchen—jars, boxes, baskets. Each is suited for storing certain types of items, and choosing the right …]]></summary>

In the current landscape of new product development, the primary risk lies in the product's ability to gain a market fit rather than technological advancements. Entrepreneurs and investors have limited resources, including time and funding, to ensure the success of their products. To minimize waste, it is crucial to prioritize investment in strategies that address the most critical risks. Venture Capital (VC) evaluates potential startups with various methods, predominantly utilizing numerical indicators like engagement and revenue quality. However, for early-stage startups that may lack these indicators or face misleading data, VCs must rely on a blended approach of qualitative and quantitative proxies to understand the progress and direction of the product.

But between setting up CI/CD pipelines, configuring environments, and managing infrastructure, cloud deployment can easily become a time sink.
So what tools actually help streamline the cloud deployment process in 2025? 
Let's break it down, developer-to-developer.
Before jumping into tools, let’s talk real-world benefits.

Understanding the Conversion Process
When you have a number of seconds, the goal is to break it down into hours, minutes, and remaining seconds. For example, converting '685' seconds into '00:11:25' involves:
Calculating Hours: By dividing the total seconds by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).

Each day, the Scraper ventured out, gathering essential tools—brake pads, spark plugs, and oil filters—meticulously putting them in his storage room. This storage room, filled with parts, was like a database, organizing all the precious data he gathered from various sources.
For instance, one day, the Scraper found a batch of brake pads. He cataloged the details, from brand to condition, and stored it safely. This was like collecting the latest prices from websites, storing them in a file for future use.
The Backend Guy: The Toolbox Handler
Whenever the mechanic—the Frontend—needed a specific tool, they would call out, “I need a 10mm wrench!” The Backend Guy, standing by the toolbox, would find the correct tool and hand it over with precision. He didn't fix the car himself, but he made sure the mechanic had exactly what was needed at the right time.
Just like that, the Backend Guy managed the storage of all the data and ensured it was always ready when the Frontend needed it. When the mechanic asked for the current price of the Euro in Toman, the Backend would retrieve that data and send it in a neat package—a JSON response—ready to be used.
The Frontend Mechanic: The User Interface
When the mechanic needed a part, they'd shout, "I need a 10mm wrench!" The Backend Guy would respond, handing over the tool, and the Frontend Mechanic would get to work. The mechanic didn’t care how the part got there, as long as it was the right one.
In the same way, the Frontend Mechanic used the data provided by the Backend to create an amazing display for the car's dashboard. They made sure the car (or website) looked stunning, with neatly organized parts (like the prices) and a smooth-running engine (user interface). Whether it was showing prices in a nice table or providing a simple, user-friendly experience, the Frontend Mechanic made sure everything was visually appealing and functional.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has come a long way since its beginnings. What started as spinning up cloud resources has now grown into a full-blown ecosystem with a very engaged community. IaC on its own can add a lot of complexity to your processes and cause more issues, but combined with governance, compliance, security, deployment strategies, self-service, it easily becomes the fuel your delivery engine needs.
This year, IaCConf debuts as a virtual event by bringing together this community, and it’s shaping up to be one of the most relevant and practical events in the space.
Unlike broader DevOps/SRE or cloud-native events, IACConf is focused on the challenges and innovations around defining infrastructure as code. That means the content goes deeper, the conversations are more relevant, and the takeaways are directly applicable to your processes.
There will be sessions on:
Getting started with IaC
Managing IaC at scale across teams and environments (using OpenTofu, Terraform, Ansible, Crossplane, and others)
Platform Engineering and IaC
How IaC impacts your maturity
AI in IaC
And that’s just scratching the surface. Check out the full agenda here.
One of the things I appreciate most about this conference is that it’s not about product pitches or high-level fluff. Practitioners share what worked, what broke, and how they improved. Whether you are just starting out, are in the trenches, or shaping platform strategy, there’s something for you here.
On another note, I’m also excited to contribute to this year’s lineup with a session on Getting Started with IaC, together with my colleague Emin Alemdar. But honestly, I’m just as excited to learn and to connect with others working through the same challenges.
The event will be on Thu, May 15, 2025 @ 11:00am EDT, so don’t forget to register here.

Forms are fundamental in web applications as they enable users to input data. Whether you're collecting user information, comments, or other types of data, forms serve as the primary interface for user interactions. In Ruby on Rails, handling forms is made simple with built-in helpers that streamline the process and ensure your application remains secure.

When I first started learning Go (Golang), everything felt a little strange. Coming from the Python and JavaScript background😅😅., I expected to deal with new syntax, but I didn’t expect to get stuck on the very first line of every Go file:
package main
I remember asking myself:
"Why do we declare the package name before the start of any code?"
📦 What Is a Package in Go?
In Go, as well as other languages like Python, a package is a way to organize and reuse code. Every .go file must start by declaring which package it belongs to.
There are two kinds of packages you’ll encounter early on:
main: This package is special. It tells the Go compiler that this file is part of an executable program.
Library packages: These are packages meant to be imported into othe…]]></summary>

Once something changes, the detective detects the change and decides what action to take.

Let’s say you have a shopping cart on your website, and the price of the cart updates whenever an item is added or removed. You need Sherlock Holmes (MutationObserver) to catch these updates and notify you.

This breakdown outlines how MACD identified major market movements on the BTC/USDT weekly chart using data-driven signals.

Momentum Breakout – Early 2023


In early 2023, MACD moved above the signal line with an expanding histogram. This was not just a routine crossover; it indicated strong bullish momentum following BTC’s recovery from 2022 lows.

In a Cointelegraph interview at the Token20249 event in Dubai, OKX MENA CEO Rifad Mahasneh warned that while tokenization is promising, projects must “clearly demonstrate” the benefits of tokenizing specific assets. 
“In some cases, we’re tokenizing things that don’t need tokenization, but in some cases, we’re tokenizing things that actually give you real, everyday value, right? And if you can see that everyday value, then that is a promising project,” Mahasneh told Cointelegraph.

This brings us to an interesting question: Is it safe to transmute between two custom struct types, OuterA and OuterB, which only differ by their inner types — InnerA and InnerB? Let's explore what the repr(transparent) conveys and clarify the implications of transmuting types in Rust.
Understanding repr(transparent)


The #[repr(transparent)] attribute in Rust is used to indicate that a struct represents a single variant of a type that can be safely treated as equivalent to its single field. This is particularly useful for effectively working with opaque types or for implementing newtype patterns.

Most jurisdictions globally are researching, developing or implementing retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). If you see these as harmless move-with-the-times digital updates of old-fashioned paper money, look again. CBDCs potentially mean financial serfdom via a monetary panopticon where the authorities closely control every transaction. 
If you think this sounds paranoid, just consider the words of Augustin Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements — the central bank for the world’s central banks.

Why vertical though?
Vertical tabs are a great way to organize content on a webpage. They are easy to navigate and can be used to display different sections of content in a single view. They are also a great way to save space on a page and make it more visually appealing.]]></summary>

Let me introduce you to SafeLine — a self-hosted, open-source WAF built by security experts at Chaitin Tech, designed specifically for the developer and security community.

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security layer that protects web applications from malicious traffic. It typically sits in front of the application as a reverse proxy, monitoring and filtering HTTP/HTTPS requests in real time.
WAFs can block common attacks like:
SQL Injection (SQLi)
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Remote Code Execution (RCE)
Business logic abuse
Zero-day vulnerabilities
App-specific exploits (e.g., WordPress, Joomla, Drupal)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
When developing Angular applications, particularly with Angular Material, you might encounter issues regarding the mat-list and mat-divider components. Many developers wonder whether to use ngFor inside the mat-list or the mat-list-item and how to correctly place the mat-divider. Let’s delve into this topic to clarify which method is best.
Why This Issue Arises
The confusion around where to implement ngFor and the positioning of mat-divider often stems from how Angular handles component rendering. Using ngFor within the mat-list means that each item is rendered as part of the list itself; thus, the dividers are less likely to show correctly if their placement isn’t considered carefully. Conversely, applying ngFor to mat-list-item makes each list item independent and potentiall…]]></summary>

While companies focus heavily on selecting the right frameworks and models for their chatbots, they often underestimate what happens after development: the testing phase. According to recent surveys, nearly 90% of companies acknowledge they need stack upgrades to deploy AI agents—but even with those upgrades, manual UAT remains the silent killer of deployment timelines.

Instead of allowing direct communication, it processes and forwards requests on behalf of users. This not only hides internal network details from outsiders but also allows the firewall to thoroughly inspect data before it reaches its destination.
Unlike traditional firewalls that operate primarily at the network or transport layer, proxy firewalls operate at the application layer. They intercept requests, evaluate the content, and relay approved traffic. This additional layer of inspection allows for more granular control, helping detect threats embedded in seemingly legitimate requests—such as malware hidden in web traffic or email attachm…]]></summary>

Many developers encounter challenges when adapting their workflow to the mobile-first approach in Tailwind CSS, especially those who prefer a desktop-first design methodology. While Tailwind CSS v3 made this easier through global configuration options, the introduction of Tailwind CSS v4 has made some of these features feel less intuitive. In this article, we will explore how to effectively configure Tailwind CSS v4 to achieve a desktop-first layout while maintaining responsive design principles.

예를 들어, meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct에서 훈련(Training) 또는 추론(Inference)할 때, Tensor Type으로 BF16 이면 메모리 크기는 얼마이며, 몇 장의 GPU를 사용해야 하는가에 대해 묻는다면, 어떻게 답변을 해야 하는지 알아 볼 것이다
메모리 사용량 개략적 계산 = (모델 파라미터 * 2) +  파라미터의 2 - 3배 


BF16(bfloat16)은 FP16과 마찬가지로 16비트 정밀도를 사용하므로, 기본적으로 모델 파라미터*자체가 차지하는 메모리는 FP16 대비 큰 차이가 없음.
AdamW 와 같은 옵티마이저 상태나 그래디언트, 중간 활성화 (activations) 등으로 인해 실제 요구되는 메모리는 2~3배 가량 될 수 있음.
계산식: (16 * 2)  + (16GB * 2 or 16GB * 3) = 32GB + (32 or 48 )GB = 64 or 80 GB
BF16 타입으로 풀 파인튜닝(Full fine-tuning)시 



단일 GPU으로는 최소 40GB 이상, 안정적인 배치 크기 확보를 위해서는 A100/H100 80GB급이 1장이 권장

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have an ambitious technical idea that I hope to share with the community of developers and cybersecurity specialists:
Given the widespread prevalence of pornographic content online, and the difficulty of controlling it through traditional blocking or weak censorship tools, I've come up with a new system:
🔐 An "ethical operating system" (for smart devices – such as Android, iOS, and Windows) built from the ground up on the principle of:
"Completely blocking any type of pornographic content, whether visual or textual, whether on websites, apps, search engines, or social networks."
💡 Key features of the idea:
Its protection cannot be hacked or changed (such as the inability to install an alternative system).
It can be installed on children's devices, school devices, or even the devices of adults who want to protect themselves.
It doesn't rely solely on blocking a specific site, but rather on real-time content analysis.
A clean app store and a clean built-in search engine.
🧱 Technically:
Or as a distribution for children, schools, or conservative environments.
Or even as a layer of security added to existing systems (e.g., Android).
🎯 The goal is not to impose censorship, but rather to provide a safe, ethical, and educational alternative.
🤝 I'm looking for:
Interested programmers. Note that I'm only 16 years old. The goal is to find someone who will embrace this idea.
Suggestions for improving the idea.
Any technical or community support is possible.
Do you think this type of system could make a real difference?

Are you facing an issue where WorkflowExecutionInfo.memo is empty even after successfully calling upsertMemo in your TypeScript application? This can be frustrating, especially after seeing the memo correctly set in your workflow execution output. Let’s dive into why this issue might occur and how to address it effectively.
Understanding the Issue
The main problem stems from the timing and lifecycle of updating the memo in your workflow executions. When you call the upsertMemo method, it is crucial to ensure that the memo is set correctly and acknowledged before you attempt to retrieve it from the workflow executions.
In your code, the memo appears to be set successfully, as confirmed by the output of console.log. However, the memo is not persisted as expected when viewed thro…]]></summary>

In this article, we will delve into how wctomb works and explore alternative methods for converting surrogate characters to their UTF-8 equivalents.
Understanding wctomb


The wctomb function in C is designed to convert a wide character (of type wchar_t) to a multibyte character (typically in UTF-8 encoding). However, it has its limitations when it comes to surrogate pairs, which are a special way of encoding characters that are outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) in Unicode. These characters range from U+D800 to U+DFFF. When trying to convert these values using wctomb, you might encounter unexpected results.

Forged in the fires of precision and crowned with 1% accuracy, this current transformer rules the Seven Realms of energy monitoring with the ruthlessness of Tywin Lannister and the cunning of Littlefinger. Let us bend the knee to the unyielding guardian of amps and volts.

Chapter 1: The Forge of Dragonstone
TWCT-T-D55 is no mere ironborn gadget. Cast in the Foundries of Valyrian Steel, it wields powers lost to lesser sensors:
Dragonflame Precision: Measures 200A with 1% accuracy—sharper than Oathkeeper’s edge.
Why it shatters the old order:
Legacy CTs: Clumsy as Hodor, bumbling through phase shifts and kWh errors.
Chapter 2: The War of Five Circuits
The Battle of Blackwater Bay (Smart Factories):
TWCTs stalk energy vampires like Arya’s List, slashing waste with Needle-like precision. “Chaos isn’t a pit. It’s a $15k savings,” they whisper.
The Siege of Highgarden (Solar Farms):
Guards solar arrays against hail storms and incompetence, steadfast as Brienne’s oath. “No panel left behind.”
The Red Wedding (EV Chargers):
Halts faulty chargers mid-zap, sparing Teslas from becoming Dothraki funeral pyres. “The North remembers… proper grounding.”

The Words of House TWCT
Size: Slimmer than a Braavosi blade (55mm), deadlier than a Dornish spear.
The Dragons of Innovation
The Dark Threats Beyond the Wall
Legacy CTs: Bloat like Robert’s waistline, guzzling space and sanity.
The Prophecy of the Prince That Was Measured
The TWCT-T-D55 shall unite the grid.”
Epilogue: Winter is Here (And It’s Electrified)

These methods are essential for managing your custom element’s lifecycle, but the implementation can often be confusing, especially regarding TypeScript type definitions.
Understanding Custom Element Lifecycle Callbacks
Custom elements are part of the Web Components standard, allowing developers to create reusable components encapsulated in their own HTML tags. Each custom element undergoes various lifecycle events as it is created, added to the DOM, updated, or removed.
These lifecycle methods play a critical role:

The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. 
The proposal (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs.

The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.
Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.

Resumes don’t work.
They’re too noisy. You get flooded with titles, buzzwords, and irrelevant project summaries. So I distilled everything down to one single task. One prompt I can give to anyone — junior or architect — and instantly get a signal.
The task?
Write a library that calculates the sum of a vector of values.
That’s it. No extra requirements. The beauty is that it looks trivial — but the depth reveals itself as the candidate explores edge cases, generalization, scalability, performance, and design.
Most junior candidates start like this:

I am actively using Nix from my workstation setup to development environments, from Docker image builds to CI/CD pipelines, and even on production servers. One of the themes that comes up often is provisioning a codebase, a development environment and packaging configuration for a new project.
What I usually do is check one of my previous projects and copy the relevant parts of the flake.nix file or default.nix and shell.nix files to the new project. It does not require too much effort. At the end, N…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Backend development is the backbone of modern web applications. It manages server-side logic, data handling, authentication, and API communication.
In this post, we’ll explore backend dev using a JavaScript-first approach — with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as core tools.
Backend dev involves:
Managing servers
Handling databases
Writing business logic
Serving REST APIs
JavaScript (Node.js) – Great for full-stack JS
Python – Django, Flask
Java – Spring Boot
PHP/Ruby – Mature, flexible choices
SQL: PostgreSQL, MySQL
NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra
Use REST APIs to perform CRUD operations over HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Tools like Express.js make building APIs fast and flexible.
Express.js (Node)
Django (Python)
Spring (Java)
ORMs help abstract SQL:
Prisma (Node.js)
Hibernate (Java)
Django ORM (Python)
Middleware: Auth, logging, request validation
Authentication: JWT, sessions, OAuth
File Uploads: Multer for handling media
Third-party APIs: Stripe, SendGrid, Google Login
Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend keeps your codebase consistent and efficient. With Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB, you get speed, scalability, and simplicity.
Backend development is essential to building robust, secure, and performant applications. Whether you’re building APIs, managing databases, or integrating third-party services — the backend is where the real logic lives.

But as the system expanded to support more than 10 folders, it required deploying and maintaining an equal number of nearly identical Lambda functions, each wired to specific prefixes and jobs. The architecture became increasingly brittle and harder to manage. 
This post outlines how that structure was replaced using EventBridge, with prefix-based filtering and direct Glue job targets. No Lambda. No maintenance overhead.

Encapsulation is like a medicine capsule: the outer shell hides the complex ingredient inside, delivering only the intended effect to your body. You don't need to know the chemical makeup to benefit from it.
Encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers. Python primarily uses two types of access modifier.
Private: Accessible from anywhere.


Public: Accessible only within the class.



Similarly, in programming, encapsulation wraps data and methods in a class, exposing a simple, controlled interface while keeping the internal details private and secure.
Let say I want to make "model" attribute private so that nobody can manipulate the model name.
So make it private just add '__model'
So, question arise if we can't access attribute but we can access function which include the private attribute.
Think of like if we have attribute which you don't want get manipulated then make it private.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
If you're developing a MAUI application and are facing issues with the CarouselView control not displaying images from an ObservableCollection, you are not alone. This article will address why images may not show up in your CarouselView, even when the same image sources work perfectly with a standard Image control.
Understanding CarouselView in MAUI
The CarouselView in .NET MAUI is designed to display a collection of items in a swipeable format. Each item can be customized using a DataTemplate, which lets you define how each item appears. Typically, developers use ObservableCollection to bind dynamic data to CarouselView because it notifies the view of changes. However, while you may see indicators appear correctly, images may not load as expected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Objective-C, a primary programming language used for macOS and iOS development, has always been appreciated for its unique blend of C's efficiency and Smalltalk's dynamism. A critical feature that sets it apart from other languages is its support for **dynamic typing**. This allows for a flexible development process that enhances code modularity and adaptability. But what truly is the purpose of dynamic typing in Objective-C?

## What is Dynamic Typing?

Dynamic typing refers to the ability of a programming language to determine the type of an object at runtime, rather than during compile-time. This contrasts with static typing, where the type of an object is known and enforced during compilation. In Objective-C, this means you do not have to specify the class type of an object, providing …]]></summary>

The JIT compiler doesn't just make your builds faster—it fundamentally changes the way you write utility-first CSS. Once you try it, there’s no going back.
Let’s break down why it's a game-changer for modern frontend developers, and how to make the most of it.

JIT mode was introduced as a way to:
Compile only the CSS classes you actually use


Instantly reflect changes as you code


Drastically reduce build times and output file size


Enable dynamic class generation



Instead of scanning your entire project ahead of time, it compiles your CSS on-demand as you save files. That means faster feedbac…]]></summary>

The list of items in a shopping cart
State management is how we keep the UI in sync with the data — especially when multiple widgets care about the same data or when data changes over time.

If you're using Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 and noticing that your call to fieldClass.getDeclaredFields() returns an empty array, you're not alone. Many developers have encountered this issue when attempting to retrieve field information from classes in the Java Reflection API. The Java Reflection API is essential for inspecting classes at runtime, allowing developers to gather information about fields, methods, and constructors programmatically. However, certain security restrictions in JDK 17 can lead to unexpected behavior, including the inability to reflectively access declared fields in classes like Field.class from the java.lang.reflect package.

Imagine this:
You find a free online tool that promises to generate the perfect resume. You’re excited — until you hit the final screen:
“Enter your email address to download your resume.”
You pause.
You don’t want your inbox cluttered with endless promotional emails.
You just need that one quick download.
This is exactly where disposable email addresses come into play — a clever invention built for moments like this.
A disposable email address is a temporary, throwaway email you can use instead of your real one.
Think of it like a rental umbrella — perfect for a sudden rainstorm, but not something you’d rely on forever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine-tuning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task or dataset. Pre-trained models, especially large ones like GPT (from OpenAI) or BERT (from Google), are initially trained on massive datasets using general-purpose data. These models learn a broad understanding of language, patterns, or image features. However, for specialized tasks—like medical diagnosis, legal document analysis, or customer sentiment detection—fine-tuning helps the model learn domain-specific nuances.
The process involves continuing the training of the model with a smaller, task-specific dataset while adjusting the model’s weights slightly. This method allows the model to retain its general knowledge while becoming more effective in the target domain. Fine-tuning is far more efficient than training a model from scratch, saving both computational resources and time.
There are different levels of fine-tuning. Some approaches adjust only the final layers of the neural network (known as feature extraction), while others allow all layers to be updated (full fine-tuning). Techniques like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), are gaining popularity, especially for large language models, because they minimize the number of parameters updated.
Fine-tuning is used in a variety of real-world applications, including chatbots, image generation, fraud detection, and more. It’s especially powerful in scenarios where labeled data is limited but high-quality outputs are essential. With the growth of open-source and pre-trained foundation models, fine-tuning has become a key skill for AI practitioners.
To master techniques like fine-tuning, transfer learning, and prompt engineering, enrolling in a Generative AI certification course is highly recommended.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
We introduce a novel numerical method, ExpRoot+Log, for function approximation based on a hybrid linear basis consisting of exponential-square-root, polynomial, and logarithmic components. This method achieves high accuracy across smooth, discontinuous, and rapidly decaying functions while remaining simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient. We show that ExpRoot+Log outperforms classical approaches such as polynomials, splines, Fourier series, and even neural networks in key scenarios, offering a new universal baseline for practical approximation.
Introduction
Function approximation is fundamental to numerical analysis, physics, machine learning, and signal processing. Classical bases—polynomials, splines, and trigonometric functions—have known limitations, especially near discontinuities or exponential decays. While neural networks provide expressive power, they are complex, opaque, and computationally expensive.
We propose a new hybrid basis:

This composition handles:

All coefficients are learned linearly (e.g., via least-squares), ensuring ultra-fast performance and excellent stability.

Numerical Evaluation
We tested ExpRoot+Log against standard methods (polynomials, splines, Fourier) across six function types:
Sine
Exponential decay
Step function
Gaussian spike
Absolute value
Composite (piecewise mix)

ExpRoot+Log consistently achieved 1–4 orders of magnitude lower error than polynomials or Fourier bases.
Comparison with Classical Methods

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
When developing an application that requires seamless data exchange between C# and PHP, maintaining character integrity is crucial. If you've encountered issues where characters like 'é' appear as 'Ã©' after data transfer, you're likely facing a character encoding problem. This article will guide you through understanding character encoding and how to resolve these issues effectively.
Understanding Character Encoding Issues
Character encoding is essential for correctly displaying and processing text data. In your case, both the C# application and the PHP server are set to use UTF-8, but inconsistencies can arise during data transfers. This usually occurs when data is transformed in a way that misinterprets the byte sequences of special characters, leading to the corruption of …]]></summary>

And within 2 hours?
Most Job Posts Are Noise
Vague requirements
Tools thrown in without context
Unrealistic experience levels (10 years of Cypress? Sure.)
Zero clue what kind of thinking the role actually needs
I didn't want that. So I stripped it down and wrote it like I write tests: clear, intentional, and designed to reveal behavior.
I ended the post with a line that acted like a trapdoor:
“Want in? Send your resume and a short note on how you found your worst bug to hi@proudcloud.io.”
That was the test.
If you missed it, you failed silently.
The Best Testers Didn’t Just Apply. They Investigated.
But a smaller group took the time, wrote thoughtful bug stories, and sent real applications to the email provided. And those were the ones I called in for interviews.
Some of the best candidates I’ve ever spoken to came from that post.
Sound familiar?
This Isn’t Just About Hiring
The way you write a bug report.
The way you name a test.
The way you respond when something feels off, even if the build says "green."
QA is never just about tools. It's about how you think.
The Full Breakdown
What the full post looked like
How the interviews went
What our actual QA hiring process is like
And why I believe job posts are a mirror of team quality…
I wrote the full breakdown here:

When working with integration tests in .NET 8, especially when utilizing secrets such as clientId and clientSecret, many developers face issues of empty secret values during pipeline execution. This common problem typically arises in environments like Azure DevOps where secrets must be correctly configured and utilized in the pipeline.
Understanding the Problem
In your scenario, it seems the Azure DevOps pipeline does not recognize the secrets added to the library asset group, leading to the variables clientId and clientSecret being empty. This can happen due to various reasons such as misconfiguration of variable groups, permissions, or pipeline setup. Let’s break down the potential issues and guide you through resolving them.

Imagine walking into an engineering department three years from now. The highest-performing teams will be defined by the proprietary AI systems they've built, customized for their specific codebases, architectural patterns, and business domains. These teams will wield AI as a strategic differentiator, not merely consume it.
This is where our industry is clearly headed. As AI increasingly becomes the primary author of code across industries, the strategic advantage will shift from who can write the best code to who can best direct, customize, and optimize AI systems to write that code.
The best engineering teams won't achieve these results by simply adopting off-the-shelf AI coding tool…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked in several agile teams as both a developer and lead developer. One particular project sticks in my mind — a team of ten people, dozens of microservices, and a lot of GitLab repositories to manage.
During each sprint, we were juggling features across multiple repos. At the same time, we were responsible for reviewing each other’s code. Our typical flow was:
Open a merge request (MR) on GitLab
Move the related Jira ticket
Share the MR link in a Teams channel
Move on to the next story
When the workload was light, it was manageable. But in busy sprints, reviews piled up quickly. Large MRs got ignored, or rushed through. And tracking what was waiting, what was blocked, or what still needed input? A mess.
We experimented with several ideas:
Using GitLab labels like needs-review or blocked
Adding Jira tags
Rotating reviewer ownership by repo each sprint
They helped — but they didn’t solve the root problem: lack of visibility and timing.
Code reviews were often asynchronous and scattered. We were switching contexts constantly, jumping between repos, and forgetting which contributions needed our attention.
We didn’t need more tools — we needed a better way to surface and track reviews. Something that would:
Give us a unified view of MRs
Let us know what’s ready to merge, what’s waiting, and what’s blocked
Respect our flow, instead of interrupting it
That’s when I started working on a side project, aiming to solve this specific pain point.
That side project became Bellugo — a contribution tracker designed to help teams stay on top of reviews across repositories without the chaos.
It’s still a work in progress, but if this resonates with your team, I’d love for you to check out the landing page and maybe join the private beta waitlist.]]></summary>

In your HTML files, you may come across instances of empty <a> tags that serve as placeholders. For example:

When our team started building a new fintech application last year, we hit an unexpected bottleneck: testing time. With multiple user roles, complex verification flows, and strict security requirements, our QA cycles grew from days to weeks. This wasn't just frustrating—it was directly impacting our release velocity and team morale.
After several painful sprints, we implemented five changes to our testing approach that dramatically reduced our testing time without compromising quality. I'm sharing these because they've been game-changers for us, and they might help your team too.
One of our biggest time sinks was manually creating test users with different permission levels. We solved this with an automated provisioning system.

As developers, we all face the hidden challenge that rarely gets discussed in coding tutorials: generating and managing test user data at scale. This becomes particularly problematic when building applications requiring email verification, multi-user testing, or complex authentication flows. After struggling with this issue on several projects, I've discovered some effective approaches worth sharing.
If you've ever found yourself creating multiple Gmail accounts just to test a simple registration flow, you know the pain I'm talking about. Let me break down the key challenges:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🎯 Learning Goals



What are the characteristics of Singly Linked Lists?
What are its time complexities?
ListNode?



Has a value and a next pointer



next is a reference to another ListNode






Order in memory may not be contiguous (unlike arrays which are)
Simple while loop with a current pointer can be used:
cur = ListNode1
while cur:
    cur = cur.next

⌚ Time complexity is O(n) , where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
Now if the Linked List is circular (i.e. last node points back to first) traversing like this would cause an infinite loop.
It would be helpful if we’re keeping track of the head and the tail of the linked list using pointers
Advantage over array is that inserting is always O(1) even if we insert in middle.
Let’s say we wanna add at the end or tail :
tail.next = NewListNode
tail = NewListNode
# or this line 'tail = tail.next', both are correct

⌚ Time complexity is O(1) 
Removing any node is constant time ASSUMING we have a pointer to the previous node.
Let’s say we wanna remove the second node:
head.next = head.next.next
# Just set the next pointer of head to the one after the deleted node

Can be assumed that garbage collection will take place for the deleted node
⌚ Time complexity is O(1) 
For both of these operations, the caveat is if we don’t have a reference to the node at the desired position (head or tail), the time will still be O(n)



Operation
Big-O




Reading/ Access
O(n)


Traversal/ Search
O(n)


Insertion
O(1)*


Deletion
O(1)*



*Assumes you have a reference to the node at the position (if not it is O(n) )

A schematic diagram is a graphical representation of an electronic circuit.

It shows how components like resistors, capacitors, ICs, and connectors are connected on the board.
Helps in diagnosing hardware issues
Saves time in troubleshooting
Improves your understanding of board-level repair
GND (Ground): Usually marked with a downward triangle


VCC / VBAT: Main power lines


Resistor (R), Capacitor (C), Inductor (L)


U, Q, D labels: Indicate ICs, transistors, diodes
Start from the battery input, trace the voltage line, check for filters or protection ICs, and identify where the current flow might be interrupted.
Use a multimeter alongside the schematic to test continuity and voltage levels on each section of the board.

In this article, we will explore how to write a SELECT SQL query in Oracle 19c to identify the latest account numbers from specific groups based on the previous account numbers. This technique can be beneficial when managing hierarchical data structures where records are interconnected through identifiers. By utilizing SQL, we can efficiently retrieve the latest entries for each group from a dataset.
Understanding the Data Structure
The given dataset consists of two columns: Account Number and Previous Number. The Account Number represents the current identifier, while the Previous Number indicates the preceding account number in the group hierarchy. With this structure, we can determine the latest account number for each defined group.
To visualize the dataset:

Every morning, we grab our phones and open a weather app. But ever since I started my 30-day Linux challenge, I’ve been doing it differently.
terminal. Yes, the terminal!
if you need an umbrella. 
🔹 What You’ll Learn:
Check the weather using curl and wttr.in

Customize output
Add an alias for quick access
🔹 Step-by-Step Tutorial (With Code Blocks)
Let’s get into how you can check the weather right from your Linux terminal. No weather apps, no browser — just pure terminal magic. 🧙‍♂️⚡
✅ Step 1: Open Your Terminal
You can open it by pressing:

✅ Step 2: Use curl with wttr.in
This command shows you the weather forecast in your current city using the terminal:

✅ Step 3: Check Weather for a Specific City
Want to check the weather in Delhi, UK, or USA? Just add the city name:


✅ Step 4: Customize the Output

🎯 Metric Units (Celsius)

🧼 No ASCII Graphics (Plain Output)

✅ Step 5: Create a Weather Shortcut (Alias)
Want to type weather instead of writing the full command every time?
.bashrc or .zshrc file. In my Case, I'm using .zshrc file. 
Edit your .zshrc file with nano ~/.zshrc.

Add the alias to .zshrc with alias weather="curl wttr.in"

Save and exit the editor




Press Ctrl + X to exit.
Press Y to confirm changes.
Press Enter to save the file.

To write something in the terminal or display text, you can use commands like:
echo: For printing messages.
cat >: To write multiple lines into a file.
nano: For directly editing files in the terminal.
tee: For displaying text and saving it to a file simultaneously.
These simple commands let you write, edit, and manage text efficiently from the terminal.

I found it little difficult to run CPP project in vs code always, we need to do lot of configuration, setting to debug the code.
Prerequisite
Make sure that CPP compiler already installed in your machine, I will use gcc but you can use any other compiler of your choice
VS Code should be installed in your machine.
(optional) Install plugin "C/C++ Extension Pack" , this will install C/C++ extension and CMAKE (We don't need CMAKE for now, I will write seperate tutorial to build project using CMAKE)
I am going to follow below folder structure for my project and will follow same in rest of tutorial to write configuration files

In a May 5 notice, the US Attorney’s Office for EDNY said Joseph Nocella will serve as interim US Attorney for the region for 120 days or until a Senate-confirmed nominee assumes the role. Nocella’s appointment came as jury selection began in the criminal trial of Braden John Karony, the former CEO of crypto firm SafeMoon.
It’s unclear how the advancement of Nocella, appointed by US President Donald Trump this month, could affect prosecutors’ case against Karony, who faces charges of securities fraud conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy, and money laundering conspiracy.

When compiling programs in C or C++ using cc or c++, you may find yourself needing to use a different linker than the default one. For instance, your version of GCC or Clang might link against /usr/bin/ld. In many scenarios, developers want to test their applications with alternative linkers, like /usr/local/bin/ld, for various reasons, including performance evaluation or compatibility testing. In this article, we’ll explore how to specify a different linker without running separate compilation steps.
Why the Default Linker Matters
The linker plays a crucial role in the compilation process, as it's responsible for combining different object files into a single executable. By default, compilers like GCC and Clang use a hard-coded linker, typically located at /usr/bin/ld on Unix…]]></summary>

In our era, the cloud is the haute couture of infrastructure. Everyone wants it. Everyone says you need it. And few ask whether it actually fits.
This post is for those who remember that not every problem needs 12 layers of abstraction. It's for careful builders who believe that owning your tools is better than renting your soul.
And here are 12 reasons why on-premise will outlast the hype.
The cloud sells convenience, but charges premium rent, forever. When you buy servers, you own an asset. When you rent a VM, you feed a meter. The cloud is like living in a hotel room and bragging you don’t have to fix the faucet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Devs, I’m Harrison G Herdzik — a full-time tech student at Western Connecticut State University and founder of Harrison’s Tech Solutions, a small business offering practical IT support for local clients.
Balancing academics, client requests, and business admin might sound chaotic, but I’ve developed a lightweight but effective workflow that keeps me sane and productive.
Here’s how I do it — and how you can adapt it to your own side-hustle or service-based business.
🧰 My Tech Stack for Client Management
CRM & Task Tracking: Notion
Scheduling & Booking: Calendly
Remote Support: AnyDesk
Invoicing: Wave
Communication: Gmail + Google Meet
Documentation: Google Docs + Loom for quick video walkthroughs
Each tool solves a specific problem. The goal isn’t complexity — it’s clarity and control.
**💬 How I Communicate With Clients
*Here’s my approach:

Keep emails concise but informative
Use screen recordings (Loom) when words fall short
Set clear expectations and timelines from the start
Document every service — even one-off calls
That’s something I learned early on: people appreciate clarity, not cleverness.
**⏱️ Time Management as a Student & Founder
⏰** Morning:** Classwork, assignments
💻 Afternoon: Scheduled client calls or remote work
📑 Evening: Admin tasks, follow-ups, learning new tech tools
By blocking time and batching tasks, I reduce context switching. And if a client emergency comes up? I leave a 1-hour buffer each day just in case.
🚀 Advice from Harrison Herdzik to Aspiring Student Founders
 Your first client might be a family friend — that’s okay.
Document your work. It builds trust and repeat business.
Say no to bad fits. Focus on clients you can genuinely help.
Keep learning. The tech world changes fast — be ready.
Whether you’re offering dev services, IT help, or consulting — your time, your tools, and your tone all matter.]]></summary>

If you've ever tried to implement a modal that slides in from the bottom after being triggered by a button, you might have encountered an unexpected behavior when using a <button> element inside your modal dialog. This is a common issue that developers face, especially when working with CSS animations. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and how you can fix it effectively.
Why Does This Happen?
The problem often arises from the way CSS handles layout changes during animations. When the modal is opened, if a button element is included, it may trigger a reflow in the browser’s layout engine. This reflow can result in the appearance of a scrollbar, which disrupts the fluidity of your animation. The pointer-events property combin…]]></summary>

That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”

As Republican lawmakers in the US House of Representatives unveiled their draft of a digital asset market structure bill on May 5, Democrats prepared for a united response to Donald Trump’s deepening connections with the industry.
Speaking to Cointelegraph on May 5, a Democratic staffer with knowledge of the matter said that House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters planned to lead some members of her party out of a Republican-led hearing discussing digital assets.

Isso é ineficiente.

A solução? debounce()
debounce?


É uma técnica usada para adiar a execução de uma função até que um tempo específico tenha passado sem novas chamadas.
É muito usado em:
buscas dinâmicas (auto-complete)
eventos de rolagem (scroll)
eventos de resize
Imagine um campo de busca que chama a API a cada tecla:
function search(term) {
  fetch(`https://api.exemplo.com/search?q=${term}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(console.log);
}

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  search(e.target.value);
});

Isso gera chamadas demais.
Agora, com debounce:
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
}

const debouncedSearch = debounce(search, 500);

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  debouncedSearch(e.target.value);
});

Agora só é chamada a API depois que o usuário parar de digitar por 500ms.
No React, pode usar com useCallback ou bibliotecas como lodash.debounce:
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';

const debounced = useCallback(
  debounce((value) => {
    // chamada de API aqui
  }, 300),
  []
);

If you're working with Hibernate and querying a DB2 z/OS database, you might have faced a common issue where the generated SQL queries include unnecessary cast statements, especially after upgrading to Hibernate 6. This can cause errors as certain DB2 versions don't support those casts. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and provide solutions to remove the cast statements for compatibility with DB2 z/OS.
Understanding the Problem
In Hibernate, SQL query generation can change between versions due to changes in how Hibernate handles type conversions. After upgrading to Hibernate 6, many users report encountering errors like:
Could not convert 'java.lang.Character' to 'java.lang.String' using 'org.hibernate.type.descriptor.java.StringJavaType' to wrap

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with deeply nested arrays in Laravel, especially when handling configuration files, API responses, or multidimensional data structures, managing or accessing values quickly becomes complex. Laravel’s Arr::dot() method offers a clean, efficient way to flatten these arrays using “dot” notation, making them much easier to work with.
In this article, we’ll explore what Arr::dot() does, how it works, and when you might want to use it.
The Arr::dot() method in Laravel flattens a multidimensional array into a single-level array using dot notation for keys. This transformation allows you to access deeply nested values with a simple key string.
Arr::dot(array $array, string $prepend = '')
$prepend: (Optional) A string to prefix each key in the final array.
This method is part of Laravel’s Illuminate\Support\Arr helper class.
Let’s take a look at a typical example:
Input Array
$data = [

Applying Arr::dot()
$flattened = Arr::dot($data);
print_r($flattened);
[
    'user.name' => 'John',
1. Configuration Files
2. Localization
3. Form Handling
Bonus: Reversing the Flattening
$nested = Arr::undot($flattened);
Arr::dot() is a small but powerful utility in Laravel that simplifies the handling of complex arrays. Whether you're building APIs, working with config files, or cleaning up nested data structures, this helper can be a time-saver and make your code cleaner and more readable.
Next time you're faced with a deeply nested array, consider reaching for Arr::dot() — you’ll appreciate the simplicity it brings.]]></summary>

Bitcoin price slips, but BTC dominance is on the rise.

Sizable purchases by Strategy and the spot BTC ETFs highlight institutional investors’ appetite for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price has dropped by 4.3% in the last three days after nearly reaching $97,900 on May 2. Despite showing resilience at the $94,000 level on May 5, some traders are disappointed that strong institutional inflows have not been enough to maintain bullish momentum. However, several encouraging signs suggest that a new all-time high for Bitcoin in 2025 remains within reach.

Before diving in, know what PHP is for:
Runs on the server to generate HTML
Connects to databases like MySQL
Handles form submissions, sessions, and authentication
You’ll often use PHP alongside HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL.
Install the tools you need:
Local server: Use XAMPP, MAMP, or Laragon. These bundles include Apache, PHP, and MySQL.

Docker quietly builds a tiny virtual world behind the scenes — with bridges, fake Ethernet cables (veth), and routing tables. In this post, we'll walk through how Docker’s default bridge network actually works, using a diagram-based example. Ready? Let’s go! 👇
When you run:
docker run -d nginx

Docker places your container on a network called bridge (unless you tell it otherwise). This bridge is a virtual switch inside your host.
Your container:
Gets its own virtual Ethernet interface

Talks to other containers via the bridge
Reaches the outside world via NAT routing



Let’s break this down visually.

According to a May 5 press release issued by the agency, the Karen National Army has been orchestrating a variety of crypto scams, including the infamous “pig butchering” scam, which lures victims into contributing more and more to fake crypto schemes. Americans “have collectively lost billions of dollars” from scams such as those emanating from Myanmar, the release reads, without specifying an amount.

  Historical and Technical Context


The emergence of web technologies has ushered in a new era of interactivity and real-time applications. However, with such capabilities comes the critical responsibility of user privacy and consent. The Permissions API was standardized as part of the broader movement to provide enhanced privacy practices on the web, enabling developers to manage user permissions more systematically.
The Permissions API was introduced to address the concerns posed by previous blind consent models, which often left users unaware of the degree of access they were granting. Traditionally, permissions like location access, notifications, and camera/microphone use were either all-or-nothing, l…]]></summary>

If you're experiencing slow load times with your current method—where each page requires a new HTTP request—you might want to consider converting your form into a Single Page Application (SPA). This approach enhances user experience by loading the HTML just once and using JavaScript to handle navigation smoothly.
Understanding the Issue
When using multiple pages for form registration, each time a user clicks the 'Next' button, a new HTTP request is sent to the server, which loads a new page. This results in a complete refresh, including reloading CSS, JavaScript, and images, leading to inefficient use of resources and slow loading speeds. A Single Page Application a…]]></summary>

So I went to https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird checked out the code and build it on WSL2 Windows 11, took around 3 hours to compile and finally it worked

UI looks similar to Firefox and feels like #Netscape in 1999, and it is developed actively, I hope we have a new and free browser because feels like Firefox is not that free anymore and Google has been too strong on browser market, it would be nice to have a real non-profit browser here. Maybe government/countries should support this kind of organizations otherwise browsers or OSes becoming like citizen monitoring tools and used for profit and manipulation, After we say internet is a human right that human should have the option of non monitored communication use in their home.
And in the YouTube video Andreas talks about SerenityOS which looks very similar to Windows 95, good old days. It is a good idea to have unix like OS as desktop. But remember this year is the Linux desktop year :D

In frontend development, engineers frequently face the decision of whether to build their own libraries or leverage existing open source solutions. While creating custom libraries can offer certain advantages, the modern development landscape increasingly favors using well-established open source libraries. This article examines both approaches to help teams make informed decisions.
Perfect Fit for Your Needs
Custom libraries can be designed specifically for your project's requirements
No unnecessary features or bloat that comes with generic solutions
Ability to make architectural decisions that align perfectly with your stack

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Em janeiro, decidi tirar minha ideia de SaaS do papel. O objetivo? Aprender na prática como levar um produto do conceito à loja. Confesso que foi uma onda de desafios (e ainda está sendo!).  
Como era meu primeiro projeto, cometi vários equívocos. Eu queria compartilhar alguns abaixo ⤵️ — e como eles estão me ajudando a evoluir:
🔥 Planejamento impulsivo  
Fui direto da ideia para a solução, sem mapear etapas ou prazos. Resultado? Retrabalho e ansiedade. Hoje, priorizo ferramentas de gerenciamento e cronogramas flexíveis para manter o foco sem engessar a criatividade. 
🔍 Validação superficial  
Criei o SaaS para resolver meu problema, mas não validei se era uma dor real do mercado. Consequência? Perdi tempo competindo com soluções já consolidadas. Aprendi que entrevistas com potenciais usuários são tão importantes quanto o código.
💸 Precificação "no feeling"  
Foquei em funcionalidades incríveis, mas não pensei em como monetizá-las de forma atraente. Lição? Agora estudo modelos de precificação antes de sair desenvolvendo novas features, usando cases de sucesso como referência.
✨ O saldo positivo?  
Esses tropeços me deram algo valioso: clareza. Hoje entendo melhor que errar faz parte do processo — desde que cada erro vire um degrau para iterar.
E você? Já passou por situações assim em seus projetos?]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the DevOps landscape evolves, tracking the right KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) becomes more than a performance metric it becomes a strategy for continuous improvement, team alignment, and business value delivery.
In 2025, DevOps is not just about shipping code faster. It's about delivering resilient, scalable, and secure systems while maintaining harmony across development and operations.
Here’s a look at the most relevant KPIs DevOps teams should track in 2025 to ensure performance, productivity, and reliability are all on target.
Deployment Frequency
Why it matters: This KPI measures how often you deploy code to production. High-performing DevOps teams typically deploy multiple times per day.
How to improve:
•Automate CI/CD pipelines
•Embrace feature flags and trunk-based development
•Encourage smaller, incremental releases
Pro tip: Pair this metric with Change Failure Rate to ensure quality isn't sacrificed for speed.
Lead Time for Changes


Change Failure Rate (CFR)


Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)


System Uptime & Availability


Developer Productivity


Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Coverage


Security Scan Success Rate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey dev.to!
GAEB4Linux, which aims to bring native support for GAEB files (a German construction industry standard) to Linux.
GAEB is a widely used XML-based format for exchanging construction data in Germany. It’s essential for things like bills of quantities, tender submissions, costing, and invoicing.
There are plenty of GAEB software tools available, but almost all of them are Windows-only or commercial. Linux users in the construction industry currently have no solid open-source solution to handle GAEB files.
The goal is to create an open-source GAEB file viewer/editor for Linux (written in Java for cross-platform compatibility). The initial version will support:
Viewing GAEB XML files (e.g., .X83, .X84),


Entering bid data and prices for tenders,


Later stages could include additional features like full AVA (tendering and invoicing) functionality.




  
  
  🌱 Current Status:


Right now, I’m in the early planning phase – no code has been written yet. I’m designing the system, figuring out the core features, and planning how to integrate the GAEB XML structure.
Developers familiar with Java, XML, and GUI design (Swing/JavaFX, etc.),


Anyone with experience in the construction industry or knowledge of GAEB/AVA workflows,


Designers or UX/UI specialists who can help build an intuitive interface,


Feedback from anyone who has worked with GAEB or similar standards.



I’m planning to host the project on GitLab, and I’ll set up a chat (Discord/Matrix) for discussions and collaboration.
Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions, and I’m open to any tips from anyone who has experience with GAEB file handling.
Thanks for reading!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've spent time working with JavaScript's asynchronous model, you know that its single-threaded nature is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, you don't have to worry about complex locking mechanisms. On the other, you might stumble into weird issues where your code just... never runs. One such issue is starvation.
In the context of JavaScript, starvation refers to a situation where a task is perpetually delayed because the event loop is constantly busy with other tasks—usually of higher priority or those scheduled more frequently.
Since JavaScript executes code in a single-threaded environment using an event loop, starvation can occur when:
Long-running synchronous code blocks the event loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR:

LLMs are great, but they’re not your safety net. Please, for the love of all things holy, test your code. 
We’re in the golden age of vibe coding. LLMs scaffold our code, fix our syntax, and fill in the blanks. We’re thinking more about architecture and less about syntax—and that’s great.
But in all this abstraction, we sometimes skip something essential: testing.
AI doesn’t run your code. It doesn't know if that method exists, if that call will throw an error, or if that edge case breaks everything. It’s bluffing with confidence.
You can’t vibe your way through correctness. You need tests to know your code behaves the way you think it does.
🛡 Confidence to refactor without fear

🧠 Clarity around what your code is supposed to do

🔄 Continuity when you revisit the code 6 months later

🤝 Collaboration with teammates who now understand the logic
A mentor once told me:
“Start at the center—your happy case. Then go left, right, and fall off the line.”
Say your function expects a positive integer. Start with 42.
Then try:
0, -1, Infinity, -Infinity

A string ("hello"), a float (3.14), or null



Now take it further:
What if the parameters are undefined?
What if the database call fails?
What if the API returns malformed or missing data?
What if a field you depend on is null?
The real world is messy. Your tests should be ready for that.
As we stop writing every line ourselves, we need to start questioning every line more. AI will get you to “working”—but testing gets you to “works when it matters.”
AI bluffs. Don’t let it bluff you into a broken release.]]></summary>

In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grumphp es un orquestador que permite configurar el uso de herramientas de código estático para PHP.
Hasta hace relativamente poco tiempo he usado W4D como entorno de desarrollo en mis proyectos, pero hace un año me tocó probar Ddev para un proyecto y desde entonces me enamoré de todo lo que aporta este software.
Ahora toca migrar proyectos que tengo con W4D a Ddev y una de las cosas que toca migrar es Grumphp.
Para instalar Grumphp yo uso el paquete de Carcheky que está preparado para funcionar con Drupal y luego lo personalizo.
Ejecuto el siguiente código para instalar el paquete:
composer config extra.grumphp --json '{"config-default-path": "vendor/carcheky/drupal-grumphp/configs/grumphp.yml"}' ;
composer require --dev carcheky/drupal-grumphp -W

Una vez instalado copio el archivo grumphp.yml que se encuentra en 
vendor/carcheky/drupal-grumphp/configs/grumphp.yml a la misma altura del archivo composer.json
En el archvio composer.json busco la configuración de grumphp y actualizo config-default-path de la siguiente manera:
        "grumphp": {
            "config-default-path": "grumphp.yml"
        }

En el archivo grumphp.yml que hemos copiado a la raíz del proyecto buscamos la configuraciónde git_hook_variable y lo actualizamos de la siguiente manera:
  git_hook_variables:
    EXEC_GRUMPHP_COMMAND: ddev exec php

Por último en la consola ejecuto el siguiente comando para actualizar la configuración del hook pre-commit
ddev exec grumphp git:init

De esta forma actualizaremos el hook pre-commit de nuestro proyecto (los hooks pre-commit están en la ruta '/.git/hooks/pre-commit`y el archivo queda así:
`bash
DIFF=$(git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c diff.noprefix=false --no-pager diff -r -p -m -M --full-index --no-color --staged | cat)
export GRUMPHP_GIT_WORKING_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
(cd "./" && printf "%s\n" "${DIFF}" | ddev exec php 'vendor/bin/grumphp' 'git:pre-commit' '--skip-success-output')

This devblog is my honest take on helping you understand the Builder Pattern—the way I wish someone had explained it to me.
The Builder Pattern helps construct complex objects step by step.
In simple terms: You control the construction process, one method at a time.
You might be looking at a Builder Pattern if you see:
A class with many constructor parameters (some optional).
Code like:
IUser user = new User.Builder().setName("Alice").setAge(30).build();

A nested static Builder class or a separate builder class that returns the same object.

The React compiler is one of the biggest updates to the React framework in years. Last year, the React team released a beta version. Around that time, I wrote an article called “Exploring React's Compiler: A Detailed Introduction”. 
It unpacked the core idea behind the compiler and showed how it could improve React development by automatically handling performance issues behind the scenes. When the beta dropped, the React team encouraged developers to try it out, give feedback, and contribute. And many did. A standout example is Sanity Studio. They used the compiler internally and shipped libraries like react-rx and @sanity/ui that are optimized for it.

  Chapter 5: Cross-Functional Teamwork Done Right


Being a product manager means wearing many hats, but it never means working alone.

The success of your product depends on how well you collaborate with designers, developers, QA, marketing, and more.
In this chapter, we’ll break down what cross-functional collaboration looks like when it’s done right and how you can foster it on your team.
Great PMs don’t just coordinate. They listen, learn, and empathize with every function.

Understanding the goals and constraints of each role builds trust and leads to better decisions.
Example:

Your designer is pushing back on adding another button to a crowded screen.

Instead of insisting, you ask about the visual hierarchy and UX implications.

Choosing how and where to store that data in the cloud is one of the most fundamental – and often confusing – decisions architects and developers face. Pick the wrong type, and you could end up with slow performance, skyrocketing costs, or an architecture that just doesn't scale.

CTags (short for "C Tags") is a tool that scans your code and generates an index of where functions, variables, classes, and other identifiers are defined. This index is saved in a file called tags.
Suppose you have this simple math_utils.py file:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

Run this in your terminal:
ctags -R .

Offline-friendly experiences build trust and reliability.
It's surprisingly easy to implement.

Lets Wrap the entire app (or any major layout component) with AppShell:

navigator.onLine: Detects the initial connection status.
window.addEventListener("online"/"offline"): Reacts to changes in network status.

Understanding API URL Management
When building applications that interconnect with REST APIs, it's crucial to manage API URLs efficiently. Typically, during development, you'd use one server endpoint (localhost), while production might require a completely different URL.

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

My friend had just executed his code — and it worked perfectly.
So what happened?
He had to log into Gmail on the lab PC
That’s when I had this thought:
Googled and found already existing ones like dontpad
So, for the next couple of weeks, all of us started using dontpad — mostly just copy-pasting code, sharing it as soon as someone got it working. Whoever cracked the problem first would dump the code there, and the rest of us would just grab it and run.
Then one day, I was sitting in class and noticed how our teacher logged into her Gmail just to download a PPT and present it to the class. That moment stuck in my mind — but I got busy with other things and didn’t think much of it.
A few days later, one of our teachers…]]></summary>

This guide shows you how to get AI answers *instantly by streaming LLM responses word-by-word, and cut them off anytime, using a simple PocketFlow LLM Streaming Example.*
We've all been there. You ask an AI a question. You wait. Maybe it's brilliant, maybe it's... weird. What if you could see the answer appear as it's typed and hit an "eject" button if it's not what you want?
That's LLM Streaming (seeing it live) and User Interruption (hitting stop). Instead of getting a whole essay dropped on you, text pops up piece by piece. It feels way faster. Plus, the stop button puts you in charge, saving time and maybe even cash on API calls.

Nah, data yang masuk ini nggak bisa langsung kita percaya gitu aja. Sebelum diproses atau dilempar ke database, kita wajib pastiin dulu datanya itu valid, lengkap, dan formatnya sesuai sama yang kita harapkan.
Proses ini, ya kalian udah tau lah, namanya Validasi Data.
Tapi sering banget muncul pertanyaan klasik nih di kalangan developer, termasuk kita-kita:
"Bro, validasi di frontend aja cukup nggak sih? Kan udah dicek di browser user. Atau mending di backend aja biar lebih secure?" 🤔

Every outage that IsDown detects shows up as an incident in Better Stack, follows your existing escalation rules, and clears automatically once the vendor recovers.
Vendor downtime seldom triggers your own uptime probes—the traffic never reaches you. IsDown closes that gap by checking hundreds of official status pages round the clock. When those signals land inside Better Stack, responders work from a single incident list. No tab-hopping, no split workflows.

What is data? 
Data, in its simplest form, is raw, unprocessed facts and figures. It can be numbers, text, images, or any other form of information that can be stored and processed by computers. Data becomes meaningful information when it is analyzed, interpreted, and placed in context. Therefore, Data is the basic unit of information before it's been organized, analyzed, or interpreted. 
What is information?
In data science, splitting your dataset effectively is an important initial step towards building a robust model. Generally, you'll want to allocate a larger portion of your data for training, very often around 70%-80%, with the remaining 20%-30% for testing. This allows the model to learn from a substantial amount of data while still retaining enough unique data points to test …]]></summary>

TypeScript is a robust, statically-typed programming language designed as a superset of JavaScript. Simply put, it enhances JavaScript by adding type definitions (a way to explicitly define the type of values) and other powerful features like interfaces, enums, and decorators. This makes it easier to work with larger codebases and prevent runtime errors by catching issues during the compile time. 
For those just starting out, think of TypeScript as a tool that adds structure and safety to JavaScript without changing its core nature. If you're building complex applications or working in a collaborative team, TypeScript helps make your code predictable, maintainable, and scalable.

What happens? 
How it comes on your PC's screen?
How it uses your resources and runs on your machine?
Well, there are many workers who are responsible of running a process.
📔 But wait before starting anything, what is a program and process ?
Whenever someone writes code lines in a file (let say java) which we call a set of instructions
class Test {
    public static void main (String[] args){
         System.out.println("Hello world");

Java compiler doesn't force exhaustiveness in switch statements, whereas switch expression are expected to be exhaustive. What really is exhaustiveness? Exhaustiveness ensures that all possible cases are handled in a switch expression, either explicitly or with a default case. For example, When you use an enum type, switch must cover different values of the enum. This is not limited to enums, its applicable to all the types switch supports. Look at the below versions of code, former one with switch statement and the later with switch expressions.

They connect your systems, enabling you to scale through integration and automation and deliver superior customer experiences. But what’s often overlooked is that APIs are only as reliable as your ability to test them effectively. Unlike traditional UI testing, which focuses on the frontend layer, testing them gives you visibility into the actual mechanics of your app—the business logic, the rules that drive decisions, and the integrations that connect your systems. If you don’t validate that layer thoroughly, you leave core functionality exposed, increasing security risk.

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AI agents are becoming an essential part of modern software systems. They can take user input, reason through goals, and interact with external services to complete real tasks. This makes them useful for building workflows, automation, and product features powered by language models.
To support this, OpenAI introduced the Agents SDK on March 11, 2025. The SDK provides a way to define agent behavior, connect to external tools, and manage the flow of actions. They ahve also extended the support for MCP recently. Tools are exposed through MCP (Model Context Protocol), a standard interface that lets agents discover and call functions from any compatible server.

Today, we will use the OpenAI Agents SDK to build a working Composio MCP agent. The goal is to show how agents can be connected to re…]]></summary>

Whether you're automating a deployment or writing a bash script to clean up temp files, there's one thing your future self will always thank you for: clear, timestamped, consistent logging.

Shell scripts often get the job done fast — but when they go wrong, debugging them can feel like trying to read hieroglyphics in the dark. Logging provides a flashlight. It tells you what ran, when it ran, and how it ran — especially when you're not watching.
This post walks you through a compact, reusable logger function for your shell scripts that:
Categorizes messages by severity (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, etc.)
Automatically timestamps log entries
Writes to a dedicated log file

Now imagine someone asks the toddler to also solve a big puzzle. If the toddler starts working on it alone, they’ll stop playing with their other toys until it’s done. This is similar to how Node.js blocks the event loop during a heavy task.

Technical View
const { fork } = require('child_process');
const child = fork('heavyTask.js');

child.on('message', (msg) => {

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said "teachers are going the extra mile for their students' education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms." The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.
Ripple cites a 2024 Gallup survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights “constraints and gaps in funding for education,” the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:
“We hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.”
Teach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its “Ignite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance” to prepare teachers.

Crypto-fueled charity
The cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.
Another player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.

Upgrading an application to .NET Core 3 often brings a variety of enhancements, one of which is the option to publish a single-file executable. While this has its advantages, many developers encounter path-related issues during the build process, particularly related to the PublishSingleFile flag. This article addresses a common problem where the executable path defaults to a temporary directory, disrupting access to vital resources.
Understanding the Issue
When you set the PublishSingleFile flag, the .NET runtime modifies how executable paths are resolved. Instead of locating the executable file in its original directory, it often redirects to a location like /var/tmp/.net/. This behavior occurs due to the way the runtime handles unpacking the single-file executable at runtim…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Exceptions in Java are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program's execution. They are used to handle errors and other exceptional events that may occur during runtime.
Checked Exceptions (compile-time exceptions)
Must be declared or handled (using try-catch or throws)
Examples: IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException




Unchecked Exceptions (runtime exceptions)
Not checked at compile time
Examples: NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException




Errors
Serious problems that applications should not try to catch
Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError






  
  
  Exception Handling Keywords




try: Block of code to monitor for exceptions
catch: Block that handles the exception
finally: Block that always executes (for cleanup)
throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception
throws: Declares exceptions that might be thrown by a method
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println("General exception caught");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This will always execute");
}

You can create your own exception classes by extending Exception (checked) or RuntimeException (unchecked):
class MyCustomException extends Exception {
    public MyCustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

Catch specific exceptions rather than general Exception
Don't ignore caught exceptions (empty catch blocks)
Use finally blocks for resource cleanup
Document exceptions with @throws in JavaDoc
Consider whether to handle, propagate, or convert exceptions

If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.
It all started when a Washington, D.C.-based cryptocurrency investor received a suspicious phone cal…]]></summary>

chat with your favorite books like you're texting a friend? 📖💬
BookChatBot, an AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions about a book, using:
🧠 LangChain (for LLM logic)
🌲 Pinecone (for vector search)
🧾 PDF loading and splitting
⚡ Google Gemini (for answering questions)
🧪 Flask (as the web framework)
You can find the full code on GitHub:

We're building a chatbot web app that can read PDFs (like a book 📘), store them in Pinecone’s vector database, and allow users to ask questions about the content!
Google's Gemini model.
💸 Note: Pinecone’s free tier only allows one index. So for now, you can't dynamically upload new books — but once set up, it's super efficient for Q&A!

Either its because the rest of the family is still sleeping in during the morning or to just sit with the laptop next to the kids while they look a Christmas movie. 
During recent years end period there was a lot of excitement about the deepseek model, released open source, so i decided to give it a try to run local.
First setting up the environment. From my ethical hacker lab I was already used of using oracle box (with Kali), so I continued in that space.

Setting up went fast, although there where as usual some extra libraries to upgrade. Also made the rookie mistake to give the VM insufficient disc space :-D 
First impression: slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow but also what a fun to use! 
Planned three homelabs as follow-up:
Using python scripts to call the local LLM (update May: done, see next blog post)
Play around with different LLMs to measure performance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've worked with React or JavaScript modules, you might have noticed that sometimes you write imports with curly braces ({}) and sometimes without them. Ever wondered why?
Let’s break it down.
A default export allows a module to export a single value. It’s useful when your file exports just one main thing — like a component.
// components/Footer.jsx
export default function Footer() {
  return <footer>...</footer>;
}


import Footer from './components/Footer';


🚫 No curly braces needed for default exports.
A named export allows you to export multiple values from a file. You must import them using curly braces.
// components/Contact.tsx
export function Contact() { ... }
export function AnotherHelper() { ... }


import { Contact } from './components/Contact';


✅ Curly braces required for named exports.

You can combine both in one file:
export default function App() { ... }
export function Helper() { ... }


Then import like:
import App, { Helper } from './App';


Hope this clears up the mystery behind those curly braces!

This issue typically arises when output is sent to the browser before PHP attempts to modify the session. Let's dive into the causes and solutions for this common problem, ensuring your Yii application runs smoothly on the new server.
Understanding the Warning
The warning signifies that some output was sent to the browser before your PHP script tried to refresh the session. This can often happen if there are unexpected characters or whitespace before the opening <?php tag or after the closing ?> tag in your PHP files. Other causes can include echo or print statements executed before session manipulation.

MVC stands for Model View Controller, which is an abbreviation for model-view-controller. It is a widely applied software design paradigm. Its core idea is to organize the code by separating the business logic, data, and interface display, and centralize the business logic in one component. In this way, when improving and customizing the interface and user interaction, there is no need to rewrite the business logic. MVC has uniquely developed to map the traditional input, processing, and output functions into a logical graphical user interface structure.
MVC is a pattern for creating web applications using the MVC (Model View Controller model-view-controller) design. The specific introduction is as follows:

License-Token introduces an innovative licensing system that leverages blockchain technology, smart contracts, and digital tokenization to revolutionize open source licensing. This blog post explores the background, core concepts, practical use cases, challenges, and future opportunities of License-Token. We also examine how traditional open source licenses such as GPL, MIT, and Apache compare to License-Token’s cutting-edge approach, and how the platform can empower developers, streamline compliance, and unlock monetization opportunities.
Open source software has long been a catalyst for innovation by enabling developers around the world to collaborate, share, and iterate on code. However, existing licensing models struggle with legal complexity, interoperability, and monetizat…]]></summary>

So, let me give you a little back story. The function I was testing is a a very simple one that check whether a user has permissions required to access given module or action. This function happened to use the JS array method called every
How every works is that it loops through the array and checks whether all items satisfy a provided condition. If it encounters any item that doesn’t it break the loop and returns false, however if all items satisfy the conditions then true is returned. However, there is a peculiar behavior to this method in that if an empty array is used then true is still returned. This is where the concept of vacuous truth comes in

Logs serve several critical purposes, including:
Debugging & Troubleshooting: Logs help track down issues, especially in production environments where debugging directly is not feasible.
Monitoring & Observability: Logs allow teams to monitor application health and detect anomalies.
Security Auditing: Logs keep records of critical events, such as user authentication attempts and database queries, which are essential for security audits.

Strategy acquired 1,895 Bitcoin (BTC) for $180.3 million during the week from April 28 to May 4 at an average price of $95,167 per BTC, the firm announced in its latest Form-8 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase is one of the smallest made by the company this year, alongside a comparatively meagre 130 BTC purchase in March.

The latest buy is 87% less than the previous purchase of 15,355 BTC announced last Monday.
Semler boosts buying despite rising prices
While Saylor’s Strategy cooled its Bitcoin buying spree last week, others upped their appetite for BTC.
Semler Scientific, a publicly traded US healthtech firm, bought 167 Bitcoin for $16.2 million in the period from April 30 to May 2 at an average purchase price of $97,093 BTC.
Announced on May 5, the purchase by Semler was up at least 50% from the previous 111 BTC purchase by the firm announced on April 25.

As of May 2, Semler held 3,634 BTC, acquired for an aggregate of $322.3 million at an average purchase price of $88,668 per BTC.
Semler’s Bitcoin holdings are considerably smaller than Strategy’s, which held 555,450 BTC as of May 4, acquired for $68,550 per BTC.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[database server is a server which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers, as defined by the client–server model.[citation needed][1][2] Database management systems (DBMSs) frequently provide database-server functionality, and some database management systems (such as MySQL) rely exclusively on the client–server model for database access (while others, like SQLite, are meant for use as an embedded database).
Users access a database server either through a "front end" running on the user's computer – which displays requested data – or through the "back end", which runs on the server and handles tasks such as data analysis and storage.
In a master–slave model, database master servers are central and primary locations of data while database slave servers are synchronized backups of the master acting as proxies.
Most database applications respond to a query language. Each database understands its query language and converts each submitted query to server-readable form and executes it to retrieve results.
Examples of proprietary database applications include Oracle, IBM Db2, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server. Examples of free software database applications include PostgreSQL; and under the GNU General Public Licence include Ingres and MySQL. Every server uses its own query logic and structure. The SQL (Structured Query Language) query language is more or less the same on all relational database applications.
For clarification, a database server is simply a server that maintains services related to clients via database applications.

The data mart is a subset of the data warehouse that focuses on a specific business line, department, subject area, or team.[1] Whereas data warehouses have an enterprise-wide depth, the information in data marts pertains to a single department. In some deployments, each department or business unit is considered the owner of its data mart, including all the hardware, software, and data.[2] This enables each department to isolate the use, manipulation, and development of their data. In other deployments where conformed dimensions are used, this business unit ownership will not hold true for shared dimensions like customer, product, etc.

Some say the big data craze has faded, while others lament the shrinking job opportunities, the increasing complexity of platforms, and the growing intricacy of business demands. But does this really mean big data is dying?
I don’t think so. In my view, what’s truly dying is not big data itself, but rather the outdated “dragon-slaying techniques” that no longer have any “dragons” to slay. The “dragon” has evolved, while our weapons remain stuck in the past. Technology needs to evolve, architectures need to be restructured, and capabilities need to be upgraded.

What platform, genre, or tags are selected?
Managing all of that with separate useState hooks or deeply nested props can quickly become a nightmare. Enter the Query Object Pattern.
A Query Object is a single JavaScript object that encapsulates all your query parameters—filter values, sort order, pagination, etc.
const [query, setQuery] = useState({
  genreId: null,
  platformId: null,

1. Startup & Shutdown Times:
VMs generally take longer to start up and shut down compared to containers, which can impact the speed of deployment and scaling.
This delay can be a bottleneck in environments requiring rapid provisioning and de-provisioning of resources.
2. Dynamic Resource Allocation is Complex:
VMs rely on hypervisors(such as VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V) to manage and allocate resources like CPU, memory and storage. This adds complexity because the hypervisor needs to handle various resource demands and ensure fare distribution. (Earlier we would need to Shutdown the VM for changing the allocated resources but now this can be done on a running instance as well but it still needs input/human intervention and its complex)

In an interview at the Token20249 event in Dubai, Aptos’ head of ecosystem, Ash Pampati, told Cointelegraph that they see Web2.5 platforms earn “tons of revenue” within Aptos. He noted that consumer-focused applications in particular are thriving on the network.
Web2.5 is a term used to describe a combination of Web2 and Web3 technologies. The term describes platforms or applications that blend centralized Web2 experiences with decentralized Web3 elements. 
These applications often avoid full decentralization, drawing criticism for not fully embracing the Web3 vision.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[message queues or event streaming platforms play a critical role in enabling this communication.
But here's the key question:
How reliably is a message delivered from sender to receiver?
Let’s break down the three core delivery semantics you’ll encounter in real-world systems 👇
At-Most Once


🔹 Messages are delivered zero or one time
No retries, so if something fails — the message is lost
no guarantee of delivery
💡 Use case: Monitoring metrics, logs, or telemetry where occasional loss is acceptable.
At-Least Once


🔹 Messages are never lost
may be delivered multiple times
deduplicate on the consumer side
💡 Use case: Order processing, notifications, analytics — where duplicates can be filtered or ignored.
Exactly Once


🔹 Each message is delivered only once, no duplicates, no loss
very hard to implement
complexity, latency, and often performance trade-offs
💡 Use case: Financial transactions, trading systems, accounting — where idempotency is not supported and every operation must be precise.
Choosing the right delivery guarantee isn’t just about tech — it’s about your use case and business priorities.
a single duplicate message could cost thousands.
📌 Message Queue vs Event Streaming Platform?
🔹 Message Queues (like RabbitMQ, SQS): Focus on reliability and order for point-to-point communication.
🔹 Event Streaming Platforms (like Kafka, Pulsar): Optimized for broadcasting, storing, and replaying high-throughput event logs. Ideal for event-driven systems and real-time analytics.
What’s your go-to strategy for delivery semantics in distributed systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s be honest. You've spent hours wrangling with bloated WordPress themes or waiting on backend fixes just to launch a simple page. Sound familiar?
It’s not you. It’s the traditional CMS model.
Let’s talk about why headless CMS is the quiet hero that’s helping frontend developers like you build faster and smarter.
What Is a Headless CMS (And Why Should You Care)?


In dev-speak: it’s a CMS without a front-end layer.
In real talk: it gives you content via API and lets you build the frontend however you want.
So instead of battling clunky plugins and rigid templates, you’re free to code with your favorite stack — React, Next.js, Vue, whatever.
1. Speed Boost with Modern Dev Tools


Headless CMS platforms are made to play well with modern JavaScript. You can:
Pull content via REST or GraphQL
Use static site generators like Next.js for blazing performance
Integrate easily with CI/CD workflows
Translation? You ship faster — and with less backend drama.
2. Frontend Freedom = Faster Iteration


No more begging backend devs to make a template change.
With headless, you’re in full control of the UI/UX. Want to test a new layout or animation? Go for it. Your content comes clean and structured — so you can design and iterate freely.
## 3. Better Dev-Content Team Workflow
They update copy. You build features. No blockers.
4. Scale Without Slowing Down


Need to serve content across web, mobile, and IoT? No problem.
You can scale globally, without rebuilding everything from scratch.
Final Thought: Headless Is Built for How Developers Actually Work
If you’re tired of waiting on legacy systems and want a faster, cleaner development experience, it might be time to switch.
Want to See It in Action?


Try a free headless CMS demo with Caisy.
It’s built with developers in mind — lightning-fast, API-driven, and perfect for JS frameworks.]]></summary>

Let me be honest SQL has been giving me a hard time for a while. So, I was getting stuck even with the basics. So I decided to stop running away and build a real project from scratch: a student enrollment system. 
I wanted something simple but useful, where I could understand how real systems are built with SQL,,including relationships, foreign keys, and triggers. This is how it went down.
This project is all about managing a small school system. It handles:
Storing student info (name, email, date of birth)
Keeping track of instructors
Linking courses to instructors
Enrolling students to courses
Logging every enrollment using a trigger

Next.js - Image Component
Importing images used the 'import' keyword for the image 'src' breaks jest test #26749
Jest - Manual Mocks
React Testing Library
MDN JavaScript - Rest parameters
When testing a React component with Jest and the React Testing Library, this error occurs if the component renders a Next.js Image component and the Next.js Image component is not mocked.
Error: Uncaught [Error: Image with src "test-file-stub" is missing required "width" property.]

To allow passing dynamic properties into the mock image component so that it can handle different test cases, modify the mock image to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
In jest/setup.js, add the following:
jest.mock('next/image', () => ({
  __esModule: true,
  default: (props) => {
    return <img {...props} />;
  },
}));

For example,
const renderResult = render(<Header {...props} />);
container = renderResult.container;
console.debug(container.innerHTML);

This will output the following in the terminal:
<header class="main-header"><div class="container-h"><div class="main-header__top"><a class="main-header__logo-link" href="/"><img class="main-header__logo" src="test-file-stub" alt="test alt"></a><div class="main-header__top-right"><div class="main-header__dropdown-btns"></div></div></div><div class="main-header__bottom"><nav role="navigation">Mocked Nav</nav></div></div></header>]]></summary>

Virtual DOM and selective updates
What is the Virtual DOM?
Diffing Algorithm 🔄
Selective Updates
// Conceptual illustration—React does something like:
const prevVDOM = renderApp(props);
const nextVDOM = renderApp(newProps);
const patches = diff(prevVDOM, nextVDOM);
applyPatchesToDOM(patches);

Keys 🔑
// ❌ Bad: key={index}
<ul>
  {items.map((item, index) => (
    <li key={index}>{item.name}</li>
  ))}
</ul>

// ✅ Good: key={item.id}
<ul>
  {items.map(item => (
    <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
  ))}

Rendering 500+ rows at once kills performance. Virtualization renders only the visible portion of a list.Tools …]]></summary>

Tether CEO Paolo Adroino took to X on May 5 to tease the imminent launch of Tether AI, the company’s new AI platform designed to offer “personal infinite intelligence.”
According to Ardoino, Tether’s AI platform will be integrated with USDt (USDT) and Bitcoin (BTC) payments, allowing users to make transactions directly through a peer-to-peer (P2P) network.

For years, we've juggled comprehensive libraries like Material UI, Ant Design, or Chakra UI. They offer a wealth of pre-built components, but often come with trade-offs: heavy bundle sizes, complex style overrides, and a feeling of being locked into their specific ecosystem and design opinions. Then came Shadcn/ui, and for many developers like myself, it fundamentally changed the game.

Shadcn/ui isn't a component library in the traditional sense.

In a May 5 X post, Buterin explained that there is a right time for rollup-based scalability solutions to transition to a decentralized model. This moment depends on how low the proof system’s failure probability has fallen compared with the risks introduced by centralization.
Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang explained in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Dev.to community! 👋
As a developer, I often found myself repeating the same Git commands over and over again during my workflow...

So I built a small CLI tool called gitNull to make that easier!
gitNull?


A lightweight GitFlow helper written in Node.js.

It automates common git actions like:
gitNull start-feature <name>
gitNull finish-feature <name>
gitNull push – adds, commits and pushes in one command
With a retro CLI look and some colorful feedback thanks to chalk and figlet.
I love clean workflows, and I always wished Git had something a bit more guided.

I didn’t want a full GUI — just a faster terminal flow.
This is my first attempt at building a CLI tool, and I'm sharing it to get feedback and ideas from the community.

Check it out on GitHub:

https://github.com/faithreborn/gitnull
Whether you're a CLI junkie, a GitFlow user, or someone who just hates typing long commands —

I’d really appreciate if you give it a try and tell me what you think. ❤️
Any feedback, issues or PRs are welcome!
Thanks for reading 🙌]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using gRPC, one of its biggest advantages over traditional REST is the use of a single long-lived connection over HTTP/2.
What does that mean?


Unlike REST where every request opens a new connection, gRPC establishes one persistent connection between the client and the server. Through this connection, multiple messages can be exchanged — in both directions — without reopening it each time.
Think of it like this:


Imagine going to a restaurant. With REST, you’d have to enter and exit the restaurant every time you wanted to order something new. But with gRPC, you sit down once, and continue to place multiple orders and have conversations — all through that single session.
Benefits of gRPC’s Long-Lived Connection:



✅ Reduced latency
✅ Real-time communication
✅ Efficient use of resources
✅ Bidirectional streaming supported
Use Cases:


Perfect for real-time apps like online games, chat systems, IoT devices, and microservice communications — where speed and efficiency matter most.]]></summary>

The concept of sequence modeling is fundamental to understanding RNNs. Many real-world problems involve sequences, where the order of elements carries significant meaning. For example, in language, the meaning of a sentence depends heavily on the order of the words. Similarly, in video analysis, the sequence of frames determines the action being performed. RNNs excel at capturing these dependencies, making them a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. The application of RNNs is prevalent in the field of deep learning. 
The history of RNNs is marked by continuous evolution. Early RNN architectures faced challenges like the vanishing gradient problem, which hindered their ability to learn long-range dependencies. However, innovations like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Data Scraping?
Data scraping (or web scraping) refers to the process of automatically extracting data from websites or other online sources. The purpose is to gather structured data from unstructured sources, like web pages, and transform it into a more usable format for analysis or other purposes. Web scraping usually involves retrieving information from HTML or web APIs and processing it to fit specific needs.
Unlike manual methods, data scraping uses automated techniques to extract data at scale, making it faster and more efficient. The extracted data is often saved in formats like CSV, JSON, or databases for easy analysis and usage.

For years, launching a crypto project in the United States has been a maze of uncertainty. Legal ambiguity and a hostile regulatory environment have driven founders offshore, turning places like Switzerland and the Cayman Islands into global hubs for blockchain innovation. 
With Trump’s election, things finally started to change, with a US administration openly declaring its intention to be crypto-friendly. Yet, despite the rhetoric, nothing concrete has changed so far.
Launching a crypto project in the US is just as difficult as ever. US regulatory agencies continue to offer nothing but vague threats and “regulation by enforcement” lawsuits. America wants to be a leader in crypto, but, even under the Trump administration, it isn’t taking action to…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're stepping into blockchain development, you're spoiled for choice when it comes to programming languages. Whether it's Solidity for smart contracts, JavaScript for web3 apps, or Python for scripting tools — each has its place. But among them all, C++ continues to be one of the most powerful languages for blockchain programming.
💡 So, Why Is C++ So Valuable in Blockchain?
🔧 1. Memory & CPU Control
🧵 2. Advanced Multi-threading
📦 3. Object-Oriented with Compile-Time Polymorphism
🚚 4. Move Semantics
🛡️ 5. Code Isolation & Namespace Handling
🕰️ 6. Maturity and Tooling
⚖️ C++ is complex and has a steep learning curve. But for developers who put in the time, the performance benefits are massive — especially for low-level blockchain infrastructure like Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero, and Stellar.
🆚 C++ vs. Other Blockchain-Friendly Languages



Language
Best For
Key Benefit




C++
Core blockchain engines
Low-level control, speed, security


Solidity
Ethereum smart contracts
Tailored for Ethereum, easier for beginners


Python
Tools, scripts, APIs
Readable, quick prototyping


JavaScript
Web3 frontends
Ubiquitous on the web



If you're serious about diving deep into blockchain development, especially at the protocol level, learning C++ is absolutely worth your time. It's not beginner-friendly, but it's battle-tested and used in some of the most successful crypto projects today.
Want to start? Try building a simple blockchain in C++ — you’ll learn a ton about how blockchains work under the hood.]]></summary>

The issue, first identified on April 16, could have enabled an attacker to mint unauthorized tokens and withdraw them from user accounts. 
Although the vulnerability was patched without evidence of active exploitation, the method of resolution raised renewed scrutiny over the centralization of communication within Solana’s validator ecosystem.
The flaw was located in two key programs used within the Solana ecosystem:
- Token-2022: The primary module handling token minting and account logic.

- ZK ElGamal Proof: Responsible for verifying zero-knowledge proofs related to account balances.

Laravel provides a robust validation system, but sometimes you may need to define custom validation rules to handle specific use cases. With Laravel 12, the process of creating custom validation rules has been streamlined with improved syntax and features.
In this article, we’ll explore how to create and use custom validation rules in Laravel 12.
While Laravel’s built-in validation rules cover most scenarios, there are cases where you need more flexibility. For example:
Validating a username to ensure it doesn’t contain special characters. 
Checking if a value exists in an external API.
Enforcing complex business logic.
Custom validation rules allow you to encapsulate this logic in a reusable and testable way.

Users often want their entire dataset to be visible, irrespective of the current zoom level. In this article, we will explore how to ensure all data points in your ECharts bar chart remain visible, even under various zoom settings.
Understanding ECharts and Zooming
ECharts is a powerful open-source charting library that enables developers to create interactive charts effortlessly. Bar charts (like the one in your example) are especially useful for comparing different categories of data. However, when zooming in on a chart, some data points can fall outside of the visible area due to the scaling of the axes or the chart dimension limitations.

The answer lies in a Certificate Chain of Trust that checks website identities with SSL/TLS. This chain of digital certificates connects users to websites through verification steps.
For more detailed information you can refer article certificate chain of trust
At the top of the chain is the Root Certificate. This is issued by a Root Certificate Authority (CA). These root certificates are pre-installed and trusted by operating systems and browsers. Since they are self-signed, they serve as the anchor of trust for the entire chain.
Next in line is the Intermediate Certificate, which acts as a bridge between the root and the final certificate. The root certificate signs the intermediate, and the intermedia…]]></summary>

During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 
Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players’ interests. 
“We’re going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they’re not sustainable,” he said.

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…]]></summary>

At first, I thought it was temporary maintenance. But after a week of the same issue, I knew something else was wrong. I did some digging on Reddit and found a pattern:
Only Jio users in India were having this problem 🇮🇳
The Wattpad home screen would load, but stories wouldn't
People using other networks like Airtel had no issues
I tested this by connecting to my Airtel hotspot instead of my Jio data, and suddenly Wattpad worked perfectly! That confirmed the issue was specific to Jio's network.

In the US, the STABLE Act and the GENIUS Act, which would provide rules for stablecoins, are making their way through Congress. 
As a result, major payments firms like Mastercard and Visa are stepping up support for stablecoin systems, and new coins have appeared, boosting the overall market capitalization of the stablecoin market.

When working with Angular applications, encountering errors can often perplex even the most seasoned developers. One common error is the TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'offsetHeight'). This blog post will address what causes this error and how you can resolve it seamlessly.
Understanding the Error
The error in question occurs when you attempt to access a property of an object that is null. In the context of your Angular application, this is often related to scenarios where components or services have not initialized correctly or are not available during the lifecycle of the application. Specifically, in your case, it happens when the MenuModule from PrimeNG tries to perform layout calculations on a menu element that hasn't been fully rendered yet.

Pros:
Easy to implement
Well-understood by engineers
Cons:
Quickly becomes unmanageable at scale
Limited granularity, causing "role explosion" in complex scenarios

No network. No surprises.

When you write Python code, you use symbols to separate, group, or define parts of the program. These symbols are called delimiters. A delimiter does not perform an action like an operator. Instead, it marks structure and boundaries.
In writing, you use punctuation to make ideas clear. A comma breaks up items. A period ends a sentence. In Python, delimiters help the interpreter make sense of what comes next.
Python uses delimiters to shape the structure of your code.
(1 + 2) * 3
['a', 'b', 'c']
{"key": "value"}
x = 7
def f(): pass

You use delimiters to build lists, assign values, pass arguments, and group code. Python requires these markers so it can read your program correctly.

GitGuard is a full-stack, production-grade access control and auditing system designed specifically for modern development teams managing sensitive GitHub repositories. It addresses a critical pain point: how to provide fine-grained, secure, and temporary access to GitHub repos — without over-permissioning or sacrificing agility.
Think of GitGuard as a “Just-in-Time IAM layer” tailored for GitHub operations. Whether you're a growing startup or a security-conscious enterprise, GitGuard gives you the tools to go beyond GitHub’s default permission model.

“So you’re not profiting off of the cryptocurrency at all?” Welker asked Trump.
“I haven’t even looked,” Trump admitted.
“But I’ll tell you what. Look, if I own stock in something and I do a good job, and the stock market goes up, I guess I’m profiting.”

Are you facing issues with generating a valid signature while trying to obtain an access token from the Tuya API using Arduino C++? If you’re encountering a 'sign invalid' error, you’re not alone. This guide explores the common pitfalls during the signature generation process and how to troubleshoot them effectively.
Understanding the Tuya API Authentication Process
In order to interact with the Tuya IoT platform, every request you make, including obtaining an access token, requires a valid HMAC-SHA256 signature. The signature is created using your client ID, client secret, and a timestamp. A miscalculation, incorrect data types, or even timing issues can lead to the 'sign invalid' error.

In this article, we will explore a straightforward way to replace names with their corresponding categories, such as 'Soccer player', 'MMA fighter', 'NBA player', and 'NFL player', using Python.
Understanding the Problem
In our example, we have a CSV file containing various names representing athletes from different sports. Our objective is to replace those names with predefined categories without having to manually assign each one. This approach not only saves time but also reduces the likelihood of errors that might occur with manual data entry.

Hi all.
I recently rebuilt my personal site using 11ty, and I wanted to share a bit about why I chose simplicity over flashy design.
Like many developers, I started with a more complex stack — Astro, React, lots of moving parts. It looked cool, but it started to feel like I was building for the tools instead of myself.
So I started over with 11ty. It’s fast, flexible, and just lets me focus on content. Tbh I hate npm, and with 11ty i like that there's no bundlers, no frameworks. Just clean HTML, Markdown, and a bit of templating.
The site is still a work in progress, but I like how it feels now — more personal, less performative. It’s a place for my notes, thoughts, and projects. Nothing fancy. Just mine.
Would love any feedback or thoughts — especially from others who’ve simplified their stacks or gone the “digital garden” route.
Thanks for reading!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto exchange OKX has brought its decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator back online with new security upgrades after it was paused in March to prevent further misuse by the North Korean hacking crew, the Lazarus Group.
OKX founder and CEO Star Xu said in a May 4 statement to X that the DEX aggregator, OKX Web3, will resume with several new features, including a “real-time abuse detecting and blocking system.”
A DEX aggregator is a service that pulls data from multiple decentralized exchanges and market makers and then presents it to users to assist with trading. Xu says, “OKX Web3 is a browser and search engine for blockchain.”

Shrem shared his new Bitcoin (BTC) faucet website — 21million.com — in a May 4 X post, which mimics the first-ever Bitcoin CAPTCHA page created by early Bitcoin innovator Gavin Andresen back in 2010.
The 21million.com website currently displays a screenshot of a CAPTCHA task and a box to enter a receiving Bitcoin address, which was not functional at the time of writing. 
Shrem’s Bitcoin faucet website also shows that there are 0 Bitcoin available to claim.
Like Andresen’s old website, Shrem’s page explains what Bitcoin is and how to receive Bitcoin.

The incumbent Australian Labor Party was returned in a landslide on May 3, picking up 54.9% of the two-party-preferred vote, against the Liberal and National Parties on 45.1%. Both parties went to the election promising crypto law reform, but only the opposition pledged to deliver draft legislation within 100 days.

The US-based Bitcoin (BTC) funds bought a whopping 18,644 Bitcoin over the past week when only 3,150 BTC were mined for the period, reported asset allocator HODL15Capital on May 4.
This accumulation by institutions and ETF issuers represents almost six times the amount of the asset being produced since miners only generate 450 coins per day.  
The total inflow for the past five trading days was around $1.8 billion, with a net outflow on April 30, according to Farside Investors. There has only been one outflow day since April 16, as the inflows have mirrored market recovery.

As frontend developers, understanding modern authentication flows and how to implement them securely is crucial. This article explores the most widely used authentication methods today: OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and OpenID Connect, and introduces some emerging approaches.
Authentication determines who the user is, and authorization determines what they can access. An insecure authentication mechanism can expose your app to session hijacking, data leaks, and impersonation attacks.
Modern SPAs (Single Page Applications) demand decoupled and secure authentication techniques that work well across multiple clients, including web, mobile, and APIs.

The best coders I've met at past jobs weren't what we'd call passionate.
By passionate, I mean making open source contributions, speaking at conferences, and writing posts. They were busy enough making money.

If you're developing a Tauri app and want to customize the hover text that appears when your application is minimized to the dock, you're in the right place! The hover text, also known as the tooltip, often defaults to the app name specified in your configuration file. In this guide, we'll explore how to change the hover text to reflect your specific preferences, such as setting it to 'Pepper', the name of your app.
Why Hover Text Matters
Hover text or tooltips provide users with quick information about what an application does. In the context of a Tauri app on the dock, having clear and informative hover text can improve user experience and provide clarity regarding the app’s purpose. It eliminates ambiguity, especially for apps with similar names or purposes.

When working with SQL, especially with outer joins, it's crucial to understand how to filter your results effectively. In your case, you're looking to perform a right outer join between two tables and then conditionally include or exclude rows based on the status from one of these tables. This article will break down how to efficiently filter results using outer joins in SQL while ensuring you get data according to specific conditions.
Understanding the Outer Join Behavior
Outer joins, particularly the right outer join you mentioned, are designed to include all the entries from the right table (in this case, table2), along with matching rows from the left table (table1). If there are no matches, SQL will return NULL for columns from table1. This behavior poses a challenge when…]]></summary>

The spurious messages were first discovered on May 3 by Kerberus founder and CEO Alex Katz, who shared a screenshot of a message made out to be from author and journalist Paul Sperry via the official nypost account. 
“What’s interesting about this case is that the scammer gained unauthorized access but didn’t post a Pump.fun address or wallet drainer. Instead, they’re messaging users and then directing them to Telegram,” observed cybersecurity enginee…]]></summary>

If you're looking to create a PHP script that dynamically reads permissions from a text file and assigns them to variables, you're in the right place! In this guide, we'll walk through a solution that accomplishes this by utilizing plain text files for configurations, allowing an easy setup for your template. You'll learn how to handle permissions, and variable assignment based on the contents of your file.
Understanding the Configuration File
The main file we will be reading from is Administrator.txt. This file contains various configurations listing the permissions. Each permission is either just a line with the permission name or a line formatted as permission_name: value; that assigns a power value. Here’s what our Administrator.txt file looks like:

Make sure to get the basics, underwear, socks, toothbrush, medications, pjs, travel documents, license, passport, – don't get deported, little gifts, etc... 'etc...'? This etcetera is the other stuff you forget and will inevitably have to purchase at your destination. Yes, I account for this because sometimes it doesn't matter how much time ahead I pack there is usually something I missed packing and have to either bother a relative to let me borrow it.
I don't love forgetting stuff but at this point I rather forget than having to change my ways, like packing weeks before like my mother does. Smart lady, never forgets anything. I'm more like my dad in these type of things. 'Men'.
I'm not sure if it's a fair thing to asume, 'all men are bad at packing' but I tell you, there is a pattern. My male cousin, doesn't travel, I wonder if he would also suck at packing. I think having a comfortable amount of money makes you care less because you can just purchase what you forget at the place where you go to maybe, – saying this in the most possibly humble way. For example, I forgot to pack belts, now I have to go to a store and buy something I already had for free at home.]]></summary>

Messaging and event-driven architecture solve this by letting each part send and receive information independently. It works like this:

You ever stare at your GitHub contribution graph like it's a Tamagotchi you forgot to feed?
Yeah, me too.
So I built something unholy:

A Bash-based automation daemon that ensures your GitHub profile always looks... alive.

It commits. It pushes. It even wakes your computer from the dead to do it.
⏰ Schedules fake-but-believable commits at randomized human hours

🔁 Retries if GitHub rejects your offering

💾 Logs your ritual attempts and successes

🌴 Vacation mode, so your ritual pauses when you need rest (or alibis)

🔥 Self-healing if a ritual was missed (triggered by guilt and grep)

👁️ macOS popup warnings like:
> “⚠️ No ritual detected today. The square is empty. You are exposed.”
🧙 Choose your commit incantations like:


feat: added function nobody asked for
fix: removed existential crisis from variable name
📜 Add custom altar messages


🔓 Unlock rare achievements like:


"100 Days of Devotion"
"The Sacred Streak"
✅ Daily ritual cron + safety check daemon

🪞 GitHub visibility flip (goes public, commits, hides again)

🧙‍♀️ Bash installer with prompt-based setup

🏕️ Vacation flag toggle for burnout mercy

🧾 .command launcher for double-click ritualism

🎨 Coming Soon:


SVG badges

GitHub profile theme pack


Guilt Daemon™ (shames you in Slack when your squares go dark)
Yes.
I built it for fun. I also use it daily.

It’s part spiritual theater, part productivity placebo, and part real automation.
Bash
cron, pmset, at, and osascript (macOS)
GitHub CLI (gh)
Dark magic
I'm testing the waters. If enough devs want this, I’ll clean it up, ship a proper version, maybe even add a front-end GUI (Tauri? React? Electron? We’ll see).
Leave a comment if you'd actually use it — or just want the GitHub link.

I've gone back to the drawing board, trying to figure out how to effectively unwrap the donut-shaped Voronoi diagram I have for my river tiles. I think this is the third week I've been working on the same problem now, so I'm getting a little frustrated because 3 weeks is a lot of time that could have been spent working on some other part of the game.
I just feel like when I do solve this, one - I won't have to think about it again, and two - the visual pay-off will have been worth it. I also feel like I've invested too much time to not get some kind of pay-off for this feature.
The biggest issue that I'm having is that when I have the shapes aligned as they leave one of the corner tiles and enter the straight tile, by the time they flow along the straight path in time to reach the bottom, they're not quite aligned.
Now I think the problem I'm having is that I've got a slight overlap on the tiles, the row beneath covers the row above by a couple of pixels - enough to make the borders around the tiles match up. This looks fine in practice, but I need to compensate for that when aligning the shapes, and I feel like this is throwing a spanner in the works.
So, I'm redoing my hex grid, and I'm using this article as a reference...

The first problem I encountered was that the encoding format was unknown, which led to many attempts to find the correct encoding.
The second problem is that Navicat reads and writes one by one. Although this does not take up memory, the speed is very slow.
The third problem is that halfway through the import, an error was reported because the field length was not enough! ! ! I had to reset the field length and import from 0 again. . . What's worse is that after setting one field, another error was reported. . .
Now, we use the DiLu Converter Import tool to solve these problems one by one.

Encoding: It can be automatically identified by default (for files with unknown encoding). If the encoding format of the file is known, you can select or enter its encoding format to speed up the parsing speed.
Chunk Size: You can set the number of rows to import at a time according to the available memory of your computer. My computer has a total of 16G memory, about 9G is available, and 500,000 is set in a batch. Here, you must set the size according to the available memory. If the setting is too large, the memory may overflow, and if the setting is too small, it will not speed up.
And The just click start
You can see that it takes about 20 seconds to import a batch of 500,000 rows, and the memory usage is less than 1G
Finally, it took about 5 minutes to import this csv file of 10 million rows x 30 columns x 4GB, and the maximum memory usage was about 1G. Because the tool imports files in batches according to batch size, no matter it is 1 file or hundreds or thousands of files, no matter a single file is 1G or 100G, as long as the batch size is set reasonably, it can be imported quickly, stably and without consuming memory.]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s positive sentiment should remain intact if BTC price stays above the 20-day EMA near $92,000.

Several altcoins show bullish chart patterns in the 4-hour and 1-day timeframes.

Bitcoin (BTC) has given back some of the gains over the weekend, and the price has pulled back to the breakout level of $95,000. Buyers will have to successfully hold the $95,000 level to keep the bullish momentum intact.
Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson said in a post on X that Bitcoin could surge to a new all-time high and reach a target of $135,000 in the next 100 days if certain conditions are met. Peterson believes a drop in the CBOE Volatility Index below 18 could trigger a “risk-on environment” favoring Bitcoin. The other crucial points needed for the Bitcoin rally are a fall …]]></summary>

In this article, we will explore how to create a generic structure with a default type, allowing users to omit the generic parameter when defining instances. We’ll investigate why the Rust compiler requires explicit type annotations in certain situations and provide a step-by-step solution to this common problem.
Why Does Rust Require Explicit Type Annotation?
Rust is a statically typed language, which means types are known at compile time. When you define a generic structure, the compiler often needs to understand what specific type to use for the generics. In your code example, you're trying to instantiate C without specifying its type, which results in the following error:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever played with dominoes, you know that the order of the numbers doesn’t matter—[1,2] is the same as [2,1]. That's the central idea behind this popular LeetCode problem:
💡 Given a list of dominoes, return how many pairs of dominoes are equivalent. Two dominoes [a, b] and [c, d] are equivalent if:
(a == c and b == d) or
(a == d and b == c)
Let's dive into the most optimal way to solve this!
Instead of comparing every pair (which would take O(n²) time), we can:
Normalize each domino: [a, b] becomes [min(a, b), max(a, b)]

Use a hash map to count how many times each normalized domino appears.
Every time we see a duplicate, we count how many previous identical dominoes we've seen.
Add that count to the result (because every new domino can pair with all previous identical ones).

This guide breaks down actionable strategies to optimize indexing, querying, and shard management for improved performance and cluster health.
Index: A logical namespace that maps to one or more physical shards.
Shard: A basic unit of storage and search in OpenSearch. Each shard is a Lucene index.
Performance is tightly tied to how indices and shards are structured, distributed, and queried.
Too many shards create overhead; too few limit concurrency. Aim for ideal shard sizes between 10–50 GB.
Avoid the default 5 shards unless justified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally posted on May 2, 2025
After a major setback wiped our codebase, we rebuilt Tavrn's 1-to-1 DM system from scratch — in just 3 days. This post breaks down how we did it, what’s new, and why it’s already better than before.
After losing our original codebase, we had two choices:

Start over slowly and mourn the loss...

Or hit the ground running and build something better.
We chose the second one.
It only took 3 days — but our 1-to-1 messaging system is back.

Fully rebuilt from the ground up. Clean. Fast. Future-proof.

And, honestly? It’s better than what we had before.
We redesigned how messages move, how conversations flow, and how it all scales.

What used to feel basic now feels tight — like something you’ll actually want to use every day.
Here’s a little peek at what’s already working in our new DM system:
🔒 Fast messaging with improved delivery speeds

🌙 Sleeker UI built with clarity and vibe in mind

🗂️ Better message rendering
💬 Typing indicators and presence detection, redone the right way

⚡️ A system that can grow without getting messy



And we’re just getting started.
Now that DMs are locked in, we’re moving on to polish other core features — including group chats, profiles, and real-time updates.
Every step is built with community, performance, and personality in mind.

No bloat. No noise. Just smooth, satisfying conversation.
Setbacks happen. But we’re proud of how we responded:

By building. By improving. By actually shipping something better.
If you’ve been waiting on Tavrn — thank you.

The foundation is back. And the future’s right behind it.
— Tavrn]]></summary>

Gone are the days when shopping was nothing more than exchanging goods for currency. Today, beneath the familiar surface of the high street and online storefronts, an intricate interplay of data-driven intelligence and personalised precision shapes the retail landscape.
At the epicentre of this quiet upheaval is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Not a futuristic novelty from distant sci-fi narratives, but a living, evolving presence within retail operations worldwide. By 2025, AI’s role in retail is forecasted to be valued at an astounding £54.92 billion. A recent Gartner report underscores its importance starkly: 91% of retail IT leaders now regard AI as a core strategic priority. AI, it seems, has …]]></summary>

We'd start with good intentions, but two hours later, no real decisions have been made.
It was frustrating, and the team's energy was draining with each meeting.
The problem?
We needed structure, not just good intentions.
So, we started implementing detailed agendas for every meeting.
At first, it felt a bit rigid, but then with time, our two-hour meetings actually ended in 45 minutes or less.
People came prepared. Decisions were made faster.
But here's the thing - it's not just about having an agenda.
It's about crafting one that guides the conversation without stifling creativity.
We found a balance between structure and flexibility with Rally.
This experience played a huge role in why you can build agendas from your Jira board with Rally.
How do you structure your team meetings?
Have you found any agenda hacks that work particularly well? (👀🟣)

If you’re like me, you probably keep hearing about how AI is changing everything and how there are all these ways to make some money on the side using it. But most articles are either too high-level or super vague. So I thought I’d share a real, working example you can try out right now, with code you can copy, tweak, and make your own.
Let’s build a small tool that uses AI to help people write blog posts faster. You can use it for yourself, or offer it as a service to others (think freelance gigs, or even a small SaaS).
A command-line Python app that:
Takes a blog topic from the user
Uses OpenAI to generate an outline and a draft
Saves the draft to a file
You can run this on your laptop, or turn it into a web app later. The main thing is: it works, and it’s a great starting po…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As someone who jumped from Windows to Linux, I've found that your choice of operating system can definitely impact your coding life - but it's not make-or-break. Linux gives me a better command line, simpler software installation, and runs lighter on my hardware. I especially love how it matches most production servers, making deployment way less headache-inducing.
That said, Windows isn't the villain some developers make it out to be. It plays nicer with commercial software, gaming tools, and corporate systems. Windows users now have a solid option with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), letting you run Linux tools right inside Windows - giving you the best of both worlds without the commitment of switching entirely.
Ultimately, great developers build amazing stuff on all systems. Your OS is just one piece of your toolkit, not the defining factor of your skills. My switch to Linux boosted my workflow for web and backend projects, but I know plenty of rockstar devs crushing it on Windows and Mac. 
What's your setup? Has switching operating systems ever changed your coding game? Share your story!

The issue you're experiencing occurs when trying to compare an instance of the ExitStatus class from Spring Batch using the ==</code operator.
Understanding the Comparison in Kotlin
Kotlin has a distinct approach to equality compared to Java. In Kotlin, the == operator is actually syntactic sugar for the equals() method. Thus, when you write if (jobExecution.exitStatus == ExitStatus.COMPLETED), Kotlin attempts to call equals() on the jobExecution.exitStatus.  However, if Kotlin does not recognize ExitStatus as having a valid equals method that matches the expected types, you will receive the compilation error: No method 'equals(Any?): Boolean' av…]]></summary>

Summary
In Linux, we usually use chmod and chown to manage file permissions. That works well when you just need to give access to one user and one group. But what if you need to give access to multiple users or different groups on the same file?
That's where ACLs (Access Control Lists) come in. They allow you to control file access in a much more detailed way.
Standard permissions only allow:
One owner (user)
One group
Let’s say you want to:
Give read-only access to one user
Allow full access to another user
And block a group from accessing the file
You can’t do this wi…]]></summary>

If you've found yourself wondering why the AWS CLI ignores --include options when you run a complex command through a Bash script, you're not alone. Many users experience unexpected behavior when executing AWS S3 commands, especially when utilizing recursive downloads along with --exclude and --include flags. Understanding how these flags work together in the context of Bash scripts can be crucial for achieving the desired results without unnecessary downloads.
Understanding the Issue
The primary cause of the problem you're encountering is how the Bash script is interpreting the command instructions. When we involve special characters, spacing, and quotes in Bash, it’s easy for commands to be parsed incorrectly compared to when they’re executed directly in the terminal.

When you're beginning a new project and want to put it under version control, git init is the command you'll use. This command creates a new Git repository in your project directory, initializing it with a hidden .git folder that tracks changes to your code.

This article guides you through calling the getFor method from a SAM trait called DiscriminatorCriteria, utilizing Scala's powerful type system and quoted expressions.
Understanding DiscriminatorCriteria Trait
The DiscriminatorCriteria trait defines a method getFor that takes a type parameter <V <: A. Here's the trait's signature:
trait DiscriminatorCriteria[A] {
    def getFor[V <: A]: Int

The most subtle bugs aren't in the code you write - they're in the code you approve without enough context.
This is a short story about a seemingly harmless line in a PR that I reviewed - and how it taught me to slow down, even with small changes.
The line of code below,
if(!user.isVerified) return;

intention behind this was good not to allow unverified users to proceed into the app.
But this return statement wasn't part of larger flow. It was inside a route guard - and it exited silently, without a redirect, message or error.
User who signed up with Google or Github (OAuth) were marked isVerified=false
This line caused the app to fail to load the protected dashboard, but displayed no error
The app just failed silently with blank screen to user.
A fallback route with clear message was added and tested both social and email/password flows going forward.
if(!user.isVerified) {
    this.route.navigate(['/verify-email']);
    return;
}

They test end to end to ensure the products meet its requirement and specification. They look for loopholes, and prevent bugs in production.
Here’s why QA is essential:
✅ Bug Prevention, Not Just Detection: QA testers help catch issues early, saving time and resources before bugs make it to production.
✅ Improved User Experience: They think like end users, helping to ensure a smooth, intuitive experience.
✅ Boosts Developer Efficiency: Engineers can focus on building, knowing QA has their back on quality.
✅ Confidence to Ship: With QA sign-off, teams can deploy with peace of mind.
✅ Maintains Brand Reputation: High-quality, reliable software keeps users happy and loyal.
A great QA Tester doesn’t just test — they collaborate, communicate, and elevate the whole team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Com o crescimento das ferramentas de inteligência artificial (IA) como ChatGPT, Gemini e DeepSeek, muitos usuários buscam maneiras de otimizar suas interações para obter respostas mais precisas e relevantes. Uma estratégia eficaz é organizar as conversas por temas ou especialidades. Essa abordagem não apenas mantém o contexto claro, mas também reduz erros e mal-entendidos.
🎯 Por que Organizar as Conversas por Tema?
Manutenção do Contexto: Ao separar as conversas por tópicos específicos, a IA pode entender melhor o assunto em questão, proporcionando respostas mais alinhadas às suas necessidades.
Histórico Claro: Ter conversas distintas para cada tema facilita a revisão de informações anteriores, permitindo que você retome discussões passadas sem confusão.
Redução de Erros: Misturar assuntos em uma única conversa pode levar a respostas imprecisas. Ao manter tópicos separados, você minimiza esse risco.
🛠️ Dicas para Organizar Suas Conversas
Crie Títulos Específicos: Nomeie cada conversa com um título que reflita claramente o tema abordado, como “Dicas de UX/UI” ou “Aprendizado de Python”.
Utilize Etiquetas ou Pastas: Se a plataforma permitir, categorize suas conversas em pastas ou com etiquetas para facilitar o acesso futuro.
Inicie com um Contexto Claro: Ao começar uma nova conversa, forneça informações detalhadas sobre o que você espera da IA, incluindo objetivos e restrições.
📈 Benefícios a Longo Prazo
Adotar essa abordagem estruturada não apenas melhora a qualidade das respostas, mas também transforma a IA em uma ferramenta mais eficaz para aprendizado e trabalho. Com conversas bem organizadas, você economiza tempo, evita retrabalho e maximiza o potencial das ferramentas de IA.
Organizar suas interações com inteligências artificiais por temas ou especialidades é uma prática simples, mas poderosa. Ao implementar essa estratégia, você garante conversas mais produtivas, claras e eficientes, aproveitando ao máximo o que essas ferramentas têm a oferecer.]]></summary>

MedRecord is a modern, privacy-first medical records management system that empowers doctors and patients with secure access to health data while giving administrators full oversight. We tackled the problem of data access control in healthcare — ensuring that only authorised users can read, update, or manage sensitive medical records.
With Permit.io, we implemented Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing
Admins to manage the entire system
Doctors can view all records but update only their assigned patients
Patients to view only their personal records
By decoupling permissions logic from our codebase, we built a scalable and maintainable system that’s easy to au…]]></summary>

A common point of confusion among new developers is the difference between the echo and print statements in PHP. Understanding these differences is essential for optimizing your PHP code for performance and readability.
echo vs print: An Overview


Both echo and print are language constructs in PHP that are used to output data to the screen. While they may seem interchangeable, there are subtle differences:
Syntax and Efficiency: 
echo can accept multiple parameters, whereas print can only take one argument.
echo is slightly faster as it doesn’t return any value, allowing for better performance in large-scale applications.
Return Values: 
echo does not return any value.

Let’s be honest.
Most AI projects right now are duct-taped chains of:

Tool wrappers
Hidden state

No visibility. No logic. No composability.

It's brittle. It’s opaque. And it's slowing real progress.
I didn’t want to “wrap” LLMs. I wanted to compose cognition.
That means:

✅ Modular agent types (search, classify, validate, build, etc.)
✅ Dynamic flow control (forks, joins, routers)

In programming, passing parameters to functions is crucial for manipulating data effectively. Java, unlike some languages such as C#, does not support reference parameters in the same way. Instead, Java uses pass-by-value semantics, which means that when you pass a variable to a method, a copy of that variable is sent. However, there are ways to achieve similar functionality using mutable objects or wrapper classes. In this article, we'll explore how to simulate reference-like behavior in Java using simple examples and provide a clear understanding of handling output parameters in functions.

Hoje em dia, com quase tudo conectado à internet, a segurança dos sistemas de software virou uma grande preocupação. Ataques e acessos indevidos podem acontecer a qualquer momento, e por isso é tão importante que os sistemas já sejam pensados para se proteger desde o começo.
Quando se fala em segurança, fala-se da proteção dos dados e do bom funcionamento do sistema em geral, mesmo diante de possíveis ameaças. Isso é ainda mais importante em áreas como os sistemas do governo, ecommerce ou qualquer serviço que lida com informações sensíveis e confidenciais. Ou seja, desenvolver sistemas usando técnicas seguras é algo essencial para garantir confiança e evitar prejuízos em todos os aspectos.

In the code snippet you're referring to, we see the use of a specific method: (*jsontext.Value)(&b).Indent(). This can be a bit confusing for those who are new to Go or JSON manipulation. So let’s break it down.
Understanding JSON Marshaling in Go
In Go, the encoding/json package is typically used to encode and decode JSON. In your example, b, _ := json.Marshal(output) marshals the output variable into a JSON byte slice b. The underscore _ is used to ignore any errors that may occur during marshaling. This is often a pattern when we are confident that there won't be an error or we want to handle it later.
What is *jsontext.Value?

Hey there! I'm Aadarsh Verma,
Sure, I could've chosen Java or Kotlin, but who has time for that when you're juggling college assignments, right? That's when I discovered React Native - same JavaScript foundation, but for mobile apps! Win-win! 🎯
Let me be real with you - I failed multiple times trying to build this Google Auth + CRUD app. The lack of proper tutorials, mentors, and clear guidance was frustrating. But you know what? I had two secret weapons: determination and the official React Native Firebase documentation! 
Let's jump right in and create our React Native app with Firebase integration.
// I'm using Bare React Native
// Open your terminal and run:
npx react-native init fireApp

// This command will download all necessary files and dependencies

First, install …]]></summary>

In any software project, every small change made to the codebase is recorded in Git history. This history is not just a log of what happened — it's a crucial tool for tracking changes, collaborating with others, managing releases, and automating development workflows.
It becomes hard to understand why a change was made
Generating changelogs becomes manual and time-consuming
CI/CD tools can’t effectively leverage the commit history
And in team environments, others struggle to follow your changes
This is where Conventional Commits come into play. It’s a simple but powerful convention that allows us to write commit messages in a structured, readable, and machine-parsable way — making life easier for both developers and tools.

        <updated>2025-05-04T18:09:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently in enterprise development, I came across a requirement to adjust and optimize a scheduled email-sending task. While the logic itself was straightforward, the debugging experience was not.
Here's what made it tricky:
The development environment lacks a unified interface to manually trigger backend @Scheduled tasks from the frontend.
Debugging by modifying the cron expression means:


Restarting the entire project every time
Risking a flood of unintended emails






While test code can directly invoke methods, it's not always clean or convenient.
Let’s look at the scheduled task:
@Component
public class EmailScheduled {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 23 * * * ?")
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    }        
}

afterPropertiesSet to Trigger the Task


The idea is simple: leverage the InitializingBean interface. Spring will automatically call afterPropertiesSet() when initializing a bean. So we can invoke emailSend() there to simulate a scheduled run.
@Component
public class EmailScheduled implements InitializingBean {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 23 * * * ?")
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    } 

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        emailSend(); // Triggered once at startup
    }
}

No cron modification
No project restart just to adjust time
No actual scheduling triggered — just one-time manual invocation
Perfect for short-term debugging during development
This is not meant to be a long-term solution. Remember to remove or disable this hack before deploying to production. For a more robust setup, consider exposing your scheduled tasks through an admin/debug endpoint or using Spring Boot Actuator with proper security controls.]]></summary>

Amazon DocumentDB is a managed NoSQL database service that supports document data structures and is compatible with MongoDB versions 3.6, 4.0, and 5.0. It allows users to store, query, and index JSON data.

This typically occurs because the state of the input field is not being managed correctly. By utilizing a TextEditingController, you can ensure that the value users type into the text field remains intact even after they click 'Ok' or use the back button to hide the keyboard.
Understanding TextEditingController
In Flutter, a TextEditingController is an object that can be used to control a text field. It helps in retrieving the current value of the text field, listening to changes, and manipulating it. If you don’t initialize a TextEditingController, the text field will not maintain its state after interactions.

"Clean code isn’t some magic skill — it’s just a habit you build over time."
And guess what? You can totally build that habit.
Clean code means writing code that's clear, organized, and easy to work with. It makes your life (and your teammates’ lives) way easier. But let’s be honest — how many times have we said, “I’ll clean this up later”?
Here’s the truth:
There’s never a perfect time to refactor
Messy code turns into technical debt — and sooner or later, you’ll have to deal with it. It’s better to start clean than to fix bugs forever later.
Writing clean code isn’t as hard as it sounds. Actually, it can feel really natural once you get the hang of it. Think of it like building something with care — not just typing stuff out.

I built AutoSecure API Gateway, a robust API gateway solution for the automotive industry that implements API-first authorization principles. By leveraging Permit.io's NGINX integration, the project externalizes authorization logic from application code and enforces fine-grained access control at the gateway layer. This ensures consistent, centralized, and declarative policy enforcement across all APIs.
The project demonstrates real-world use cases, such as managing vehicle telemetry, fleet operations, and driver analytics, while supporting multiple roles like vehicle owners, service technicians, and fleet managers.

Java has a guideline: “Don’t use inheritance unless you have a good reason.” But Java doesn’t strictly limit inheritance — you can still use it freely. Go, however, is different: it only allows composition.
So why do modern languages promote composition? Actually, it’s not just new languages — even the veteran Java mentions in Item 16 of Effective Java: “Favor composition over inheritance.” Inheritance is a powerful way to reuse code, but it may not be the best method.
So it’s worth thinking this through carefully. Without diving into specific code, let's talk about the concepts. I believe we can explore this topic from the following perspectives:

A decorator is a special function you can attach to:
A class
A class method
A class property
It looks like this:
@myDecorator
class MyClass {}

Or for methods:
class MyClass {

-Thus is a submission for the Permit.io Authorization Challenge: Permission Redefined
What I Build
This project solves a very real-world need: teams need to collaborate, but not everyone should have the same powers. QuickCollab ensures users see and can act on only what they're authorized for — no more, no less.
Demo
https://permit-frontend-oafvwri0e-navankurusersessionmanagement.vercel.app/
Project Repo

Using Permit.io for Authorization
🔐 Used @permitio/sdk in a centralized permit.js file
🧠 Implemented checkPermission() and assignRole() functions in a custom service layer
🛠️ Integrated with Express backend via role-based API routes (/assign-role and /check-permission)
🔁 Roles (admin, manager, etc.) and resources (workspace:123) are dynamically registered and queried using the Permit.io cloud PDP
Permit.io helped me implement real RBAC and ABAC logic faster than building an in-house system — and with way more confidence.
Shoutout
Thanks to the Permit.io team for enabling builders like me with a tool that makes fine-grained access control actually practical. This was more than a submission — it was a step toward building better, safer, and more intentional apps.

In this blog, I’ll walk you through my experiments using ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, along with a quick intro to manual pod scheduling on specific nodes.
Let’s go! 🚀
First, I created a simple ReplicaSet using the following YAML:
# myapp.yml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: webapp
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:

        image: nginx

kubectl apply -f myapp.yml

ClusterIP is the default service type and is only accessible within the cluster.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:

So, it's Sunday, homeboy, and I usually escape debates and negative thoughts. But today, I was scouring dev.to and stumbled across a post boldly titled "Stop Using AWS."
It wasn't the first time I'd seen a call to drop Amazon Web Services for something "simpler", but this one hit a nerve, not because it was provocative, but because it misrepresents why AWS exists and what problems it solves. So, I decided to sit back, relax, and explain why you should absolutely keep using AWS, especially if you're serious about software, scalability, and sustainability.
The post opens with a classic anecdote: a developer builds an MVP with all the AWS bells and whistles, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, DynamoDB, and no one uses it. The conclusion? AWS was overkill.
But let's be honest: blaming …]]></summary>

Mistakes at the top can lead to bad practices and cost you later on. 
Lower-level decisions (like file or folder organization within a feature) offer more flexibility—it's less painful. Adjusting or removing a single leaf from a tree doesn't impact the whole tree, but doing the same with the entire branch can affect all its sub-branches and leaves.

Think of running a software application like getting from Point A to B. There are different ways to do it:



Model
Analogy
Who Manages What





IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
You rent a car

You drive, fuel, clean, and maintain it



PaaS (Platform as a Service)
You use a taxi service

They provide the car and driver; you just ride



SaaS (Software as a Service)
You use public transport

Everything is managed for you; you just sit and go



Virtual machines
Storage
Networking
Operating System (you install)
Full control over the environment
You manage OS, applications, runtime, data
Provider manages hardware, virtualization, networking
Microsoft Azure VMs, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine
💡 Real-life example:
raw apartment (VM). You bring in furniture (OS/apps), arrange it (configs), and clean it (security/patches).
Runtime environment
Pre-installed OS and libraries
Scaling and patching handled
Focus on code and deployment
You manage code and data
Provider manages infrastructure, OS, middleware, scaling
Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service, Vercel (Next.js Hosting)
💡 Real-life example:
food truck kitchen. It's stocked and ready. You bring your recipe (code), cook, and serve. No cleaning or buying equipment.
Fully functional software
No installation or maintenance
Access via browser or app
Provider manages everything
You just use it
Gmail, Google Docs, Salesforce, ChatGPT, Figma
💡 Real-life example:
restaurant. Everything is ready – food, service, cleanup. You just enjoy the meal.

Bitcoin and crypto traders can rely on automated orders on their trading platform to limit losses and secure gains.

Stop-loss orders in Bitcoin trading started as manual risk management in the early 2010s. Now, they have become advanced, automated tools on today’s exchanges.


In the algorithm era and bot pestering, proper trading tools like stop-loss and take-profit orders will help you protect your trades.

Setting up advanced BTC trading strategies doesn’t guarantee a successful risk management plan. Monitoring the market regularly helps you understand current conditions. This way, you can avoid strategic mistakes.

Not long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve’s move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.
This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world’s most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term.

O desenvolvimento de aplicações escaláveis e eficientes tem se tornado cada vez mais essencial. O Spring WebFlux, introduzido no Spring 5, surgiu como uma alternativa ao tradicional Spring MVC, trazendo um modelo de programação reativo e não bloqueante, ideal para cenários de alta concorrência e baixa latência.
Este artigo apresenta os principais conceitos do WebFlux, sua diferença em relação ao modelo tradicional e como implementá-lo em uma aplicação.
O Spring WebFlux foi projetado para atender às demandas de aplicações modernas, otimizando o uso de recursos do sistema e proporcionando uma experiência mais fluida para os usuários. Suas principais características incluem:

Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Array, Hash Table, Counting
Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a == c and b == d), or (a == d and b == c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.
Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].
Example 1:
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Constraints:
1 <= dominoes.length <= 4 * 104

I built a simple CLI tool, a tiny experiment in multi-agent, tree-of-thought reasoning. The tool lets you simulate a conversation between different AI personas, each contributing their thoughts in a threaded format.
This concept of enabling language models to work together to solve complex problems, with each agent assuming a unique role based on its strengths, is a central tenet of multi-agent LLM systems. Such systems are often observed to outperform traditional single-agent models, particularly when dealing with intricate tasks that necessitate diverse expertise and collaborative decision-making.

Meanwhile, I also used Vue.js alongside Astro with its integration portability (sorry if it looks like I am doing an experiment here, yes I'm still learning).

On the other hand, on a lighter note the Qwen3-30B-A3B outcompetes the previous QwQ-32B with 10 times of activated parameters, and a small model like Qwen3-4B can rival the performance of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct.

Understand the key differences between Docker bind mounts and volumes, when to use each, and how they work under the hood.
When working with Docker, managing data persistence is essential. Two primary methods for sharing and persisting data with containers are:
✅ Bind Mounts
Volumes
Though they might appear similar, these approaches serve distinct use cases and behave differently under the hood.
In this post, we’ll explore the differences between Docker Bind Mounts and Volumes, when to use each, and how to get started.
A volume is a Docker-managed storage mechanism. Docker handles the data location and lifecycle, making it the preferred way to persist data—especially in …]]></summary>

I recently published a detailed, opinionated guide:
This article walks through everything we’ve learned running hardened, production-grade clusters in the wild — including practices you won’t always find in the docs.
🛠️ What’s inside?
🔁 GitOps-first workflows with ArgoCD (App of Apps)
🔐 Secrets via Vault, no root containers, SSO-only access
📊 Prometheus, Grafana, and meaningful alerts
☠️ Chaos testing and real disaster recovery drills
💻 Backstage + Dev tooling to make platforms dev-friendly
🚨 Automated upgrades, cert rotation, version hygiene
🧠 Whether you're running EKS, GKE, or bare-metal clusters — this is a blueprint you can adapt and evolve.
👇 I'd love to hear from you:
What's one trick you’ve learned the hard way that you wish others knew?
Let's learn from each other — because great clusters aren't born, they’re built.

Paint gibi uygulamalarda resmi kendi başına çizer. Kurulumu ve kullanımı oldukça basittir. Aşağıdaki adımları takip ederek dakikalar içinde kullanmaya başlayabilirsin.
AutoDrawer'ı kullanabilmek için önce GitHub üzerindeki proje sayfasına gidip dosyaları indirmen gerekiyor.
AutoDrawer GitHub Sayfası
Sağ üstten Code butonuna tıkla
Açılan menüden Download ZIP seçeneğini seç
ZIP dosyasını bilgisayarına indir
İndirdiğin .zip dosyasına sağ tıklayarak çıkart.
“Buraya çıkart” veya “Tümünü ayıkla” gibi bir seçeneği seç
Çıkardığın klasörün içinde şu yola sırayla gir:




autodrawer-master\AutoDrawer\bin\Debug\

Bu klasörün içinde AutoDrawer.exe adında bir dosya göreceksin.
Bu dosyaya çift tıkla, program başlar. Kurulum gerekmez.
AutoDrawer, fareyi kullanarak çizim yaptığı için bir çizim programı açık olmalıdır. En basiti, Windows’un içindeki Paint programıdır.
Başlat menüsünden “Paint” yazıp açabilirsin
Boş bir sayfa açık şekilde durmalıdır
AutoDrawer çalıştığında sana bir görsel dosyası seçtirir.
Mümkünse siyah-beyaz ve sade bir resim kullan
JPG veya PNG formatı uygundur
Görsel ne kadar sade olursa çizim o kadar hızlı ve düzgün olur
AutoDrawer, fareyle çizim yapacağı alanı anlaması için senden bölge seçmeni ister.
Paint açıkken, çizeceği alanı farenin sol tuşuyla sürükleyerek seç
Bu alan Paint penceresinin içi olmalıdır
Programda Start veya Başlat butonuna tıkla
Fare otomatik hareket etmeye ve resmi çizmeye başlar
Bu sırada fareye ve bilgisayara müdahale etme
Çizim sırasında fareye dokunma, yoksa işlem bozulur
Bilgisayarda başka işlem yapma, pencere değiştirme
Görselin detayına göre çizim birkaç saniye ya da dakika sürebilir
En iyi sonuçlar için siyah-beyaz ve küçük görseller tercih edilir]]></summary>

File permissions are a cornerstone of Linux security, ensuring that only the right people can access or modify critical files. Whether you're a budding sysadmin or a curious developer, understanding how Linux handles file access is crucial to maintaining control and security.
Let’s break it down 👇
Linux file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Each file or directory is governed by three levels of access:
Owner (User) – The creator of the file.
Group – Users who belong to the assigned group.
Others – Everyone else.
Permissions are represented in two ways:
Read (r or 4) – View file contents.
Write (w or 2) – Modify file contents.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we will dive into part 6 in the shell scripting series. Today we will look at how you can use a for loop to iterate through all files in a directory and the function of file comparison.
Shell scripting is essential in production environments for automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency, and minimising human error. It enables engineers to streamline deployments, manage system configurations, monitor processes, and orchestrate complex workflows with precision. In a high-availability environment, shell scripts act as reliable, lightweight tools that reduce manual intervention and improve operational efficiency.


Create the script using VIM.



Write the script in VIM and save the file.






Apply the necessary permissions to the script so it can be executed.



If we do a ls –ltrh we see that the script has been created. It has a green colour to it – indicating that it is now executable.



Execute the script using ./



The output of the script, after it has been executed.





  
  
  Stay tuned, part 7 in the series coming tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone!
I’m a designer/developer who’s always hunting for the perfect color palette, and I got tired of manually picking colors from images. So, I built a free web tool that lets you upload any image (or use a sample), and it instantly gives you a palette of the most important colors – in HEX, RGB, HSL, etc.
You can choose between different extraction methods (Vibrant, Material Design, Median Cut, K-Means) depending on what kind of palette you want. It works right in your browser, and nothing gets uploaded to a server.
Try it here: https://colorsfromimage.xyz/
Would love to hear what you think!
Is it useful for your workflow?
Any features you wish it had?
Found any bugs or weird results?
I’m open to all feedback, and if you make something cool with it, please share! Thanks for checking it out :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wrestled with a RAG pipeline and thought, “Why is this so damn hard?” We’ve been there—tearing our hair out over complexity and slow performance. So, I built Dcup, an open-source, self-hostable RAG-as-a-Service platform that actually works Very good.
It’s a tool to hook your app up to user data with zero bullshit. Here’s the rundown:
Tech Stack: Next.js, BullMQ for job queues, OpenAI for embeddings, and Qdrant for vector storage. It’s lean, mean, and scales like a dream.


Killer Features: AI-driven retrieval and hybrid search that cuts through the noise. Plus, optional re-ranking if you’re a precision freak.
Learn more



At its core, Dcup is your bridge to smarter data handling. It takes the complexity out of RAG pipelines by automating the heavy lifting. Here’s how it works in plain English:
Data Ingestion: Hook up your data sources—think Google Drive, AWS, or wherever your files live—and Dcup keeps it all synced and current.
Data Processing: Your raw data gets chopped into bite-sized chunks and turned into embeddings using OpenAI. (More on embeddings later—they’re cool!)
Storage & Indexing: Those embeddings land in Qdrant, a lightning-fast vector database that makes searching a breeze.
Advanced Retrieval: Need answers fast? Features like re-ranking and hybrid search dig up the most relevant info in seconds.
Think of Dcup as your personal AI assistant that organizes, understands, and retrieves your data like a pro.
Big files used to choke us. Performance would tank, and we’d be staring at spinning wheels. Then we got smart—batching and parallel processing turned it around. Now, Dcup eats large datasets for breakfast.
This isn’t some corporate ad. It’s a project by dev not shitty vibe coding or whatever the kids call it these days.
Star the repo if it vibes with you: Dcup on GitHub.  
Wanna contribute? Hit me up! Let’s make RAG pipelines suck less together.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[9 OOP Design Patterns You Must Know
A-Creational Patterns
Deal with object creation mechanism to decouple the client code from concrete classes.
Factory Pattern: Centralizes object creation logic and returns different subclasses based on input
Singleton Pattern: Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to it.
Builder Pattern: Constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing optional configuration.
B - Structural Patterns
Help compose classes and objects into larger structures.
Adapter Pattern: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by translating one interface into another.
Decorator Pattern: Adds new behavior to objects dynamically without altering their original structure.
Proxy Pattern: Acts as a placeholder for accessing another object.
C - Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication and interaction between objects.
Strategy Pattern: Allows selecting an algorithm or behavior from a family of interchangeable strategies at runtime.
Observer Pattern: Enables a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
Command Pattern: An object encapsulates all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you're building a web app on your local machine, sometimes you need to share it with someone online — maybe a teammate, client, or even for testing on your mobile device. But localhost only works on your computer.
That’s where tunneling tools come in! They create a secure public URL that maps to your local server. Below are three popular options:
Website: https://ngrok.com
How it works: You run a command like
ngrok http 3000

and ngrok gives you a public HTTPS link that forwards traffic to your localhost:3000.
Pros:
Very fast and reliable
Works well with webhooks (e.g., Stripe, GitHub)
Dashboard to inspect requests
Cons:
Free tier has time and region limits
Requires an account after initial use
GitHub: https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel
How it works:
npm i -g localtunnel

Then run
lt --port 3000

Pros:
Super simple and open source
No signup required
Cons:
Can be slower or less reliable than others
Fewer features, no UI
Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/
How it works:
cloudflared CLI and connect your app through Cloudflare.
Pros:
Very secure
Great if you're already using Cloudflare DNS
Free with more generous limits than ngrok
Cons:
Slightly more setup steps
Best for advanced users or teams
🧠 Final Thoughts
Just pick the one that fits your workflow and you're good to go!

  Introduction


n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that can be used to create AI agents for various tasks. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of building an AI agent using n8n, covering everything from setup to deployment.
Basic understanding of n8n
Access to an n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
API keys for any AI services you plan to integrate (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
Start by creating a new workflow in n8n. You'll need to add nodes for:
Trigger (e.g., HTTP request, schedule)
AI service integration
Data processing
Output (e.g., email, webhook)
Connect your workflow to AI APIs like OpenAI or Hugging Face. Use n8n's HTTP Request node or dedicated nodes if available.
Test your workflow thoroughly before deploying. Monitor performance and adjust as needed.
With n8n, building AI agents becomes accessible even for non-developers. The possibilities are endless!]]></summary>

Each week Mohammad S. Anwar sends out The Weekly Challenge, a chance for all of us to come up with solutions to two weekly tasks. It's a great way for us all to practice some coding.
Challenge, My solutions
You are given a list of words containing alphabetic characters only.
Write a script to return the count of words either starting with a vowel or ending with a vowel.
So vowels in English are a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y. It seems clear from the second example that even though weekly ends with a vowel, the task assumes that it is just the five letters.
This task is a one liner, and simply counts the words that starts with a vowel letter or ends with one.
def word_count(words: list[str]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for word in words if re.search('^[aeiou]', word) or re.search('[aeiou]$', word))

$ ./ch-1.py unicode xml raku perl
2

$ ./ch-1.py the weekly challenge
2

$ ./ch-1.py perl python postgres
0

You are given two arrays of integers.
Write a script to return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If none found return -1.
For the command line input, I take two strings and separate them on non-digit characters.
My solution takes the two lists and converts them to sets and uses the intersection method & to get values that appears in both lists.
If there is one or more values found it returns the minimum value. If none is found, it will return -1.
def minimum_common(list1: list[int], list2: list[int]) -> int:
    intersection = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return min(intersection) if intersection else -1

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3, 4" "3, 4, 5, 6"
3

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3" "2, 4"
2

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3, 4" "5, 6, 7, 8"
-1]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Many engineers build and deploy APIs into production.

So we have an API running in production — does that mean it’s truly production-grade?
More often than not, the answer is no.
We write the code, test it locally (usually alone, on one machine, with one user), and proudly tell the business, "Hey, it’s ready!"

Maybe there’s even a QA environment where someone from product gives it a quick click-through and confirms, "Looks good to me!"
And then... reality checks in.
You get a call on the weekend:

“Users can’t log in.”

Or worse:

“A customer placed an order, and it’s gone.”
Now you're scrambling, thinking:

“I wish I’d added logs there.”

“Why didn’t we catch this earlier?”

“How are we supposed to debug this in production?”
If that scenario feels familiar, this post is for you.

This project is a lightweight Internal Tools Access Panel — a dashboard interface that securely routes employees to internal tools like HRMS, Sales CRM, or CI/CD pipelines, based on their role within the organization.
The problem it solves is twofold:
Over-permissioned access: Without RBAC, internal systems often expose all tools to every employee.
Complex onboarding: Managing access manually per user or embedding authorization logic deep in every tool becomes hard to maintain.
With this panel, companies can:
✅ Centralize internal tool access
✅ Restrict access to only the tools users need
✅ Offload role/policy management to Permit.io

Assume you want to create an account in SBI bank. So you fill that form and your account is created.
Now you are the person who created that form. Which attribute or field you will create which is necessary to create an account. Lets say:-
Name


DOB


Aadhaar card no.


PAN Card no.



class BankForm:
__init__(userName,userDOB,userAdhaarNo,userPAN):
Rohan=BankForm("Rohan","12-09-2025","xxxx8907","KB1234")
you will find an error. why?
Because the class doesn't know about the form. It mean that you are creating the form, but for whom. If you are thinking for SBI. Let me tell you they doesn't know. so how we are going to tell them. 
By using 'self'.
class BankForm:
__init__(self,Name,DOB,AdhaarNo,PAN):
'self' it just a way to tell SBI I have a form for you.
Now you have heard some word like Instance, __init__ and object.
Instance:- It is just like Rohan want form for himself.So you have to fill BankForm as in Instance.
__init__:- Initialisation of object. Like you want to create form and decide field which is needed for the form. Like Name, DOB, AdhaarNo., PANNo..
Object:- simply it is the field.]]></summary>

When we first created Fetch PHP, our goal was simple: to bring the elegance and simplicity of JavaScript's fetch API to the PHP ecosystem. Frontend developers have long enjoyed the intuitive nature of fetch() for making HTTP requests, and we wanted backend developers to have the same experience.

Comic book collectors face a common challenge: getting the best value for their money. While the cover price is straightforward, the actual value can vary significantly when you consider the number of pages in each volume. A $20 comic might contain 100 pages, while another at the same price point offers 400 pages. To solve this practical problem, we'll develop a TypeScript program that calculates and compares the price per page, helping collectors make data-driven purchasing decisions. The complete source code for this project is available on GitHub.
Using this approach, I bought four 400-plus-page comics for $85 total, including shipping costs. The implementation focuses on the Wildberries e-commerce platform, which serves Eastern European markets. The code structure is modular,…]]></summary>

When I launched my idea — a simple SaaS for status pages — someone commented:
“You're building the same thing that already exists. Where’s the uniqueness?”
And honestly? That’s exactly why I decided to build it.
The market already exists. Paying customers already exist.
Can I sell it? Can I make money from it?
That’s what really matters.
There was a time when you could “build → launch → get traffic.”
Now, product-first is a trap.
Instead:
Before writing a single line of code, I:
Built a landing page explaining what the idea is, and who it's for
Defined pricing (based on competitors and positioning)
Started driving traffic
Measured how many leads I could get
Learned if I could "sell" the idea, even without a working product
That’s the real funnel: find traffic → qualify leads → convert → check economics.
Not “does the idea have demand?”
I’m testing:
Can I attract and convert leads in this market?
Can I acquire users profitably?
Can I turn this into a sustainable business?
That’s the difference between a side project and an actual SaaS business.
In a big enough market, there's room for dozens of products.
Distribution > innovation
Marketing > features
If you can build a profitable funnel — traffic, conversions, retention — you win.
That’s what I’m focused on. The product is secondary — for now.]]></summary>

🔢 Post ID: KPT-0002
If you loved the trick in KPT-0001, here’s an even smoother one — using a .csv file instead of a .txt.
We’ll still use the same .bat file approach, but this time we’re giving users the power of Excel + CSV to manage folder paths quickly.
Uses a .csv file containing folder paths (e.g., India\Assam\Kamrup)
Runs a lightweight .bat script to create those folders instantly
Works on any Windows PC — no installations, no admin rights, no extras




🖱️ Just double-click the .bat file

🎉 Boom! Your folders appear like magic

🗃️ It's automation, the old-school way — fast, clean, and offline
In government offices (like mine!), most Excel files look like this:



State
District




Assam
Kamrup


Assam
Jorhat


Assam
Sivasagar


Assam
Dibrugarh


Assam
Nagaon



But our batch script can’t work with two columns — it needs a single folder path like:
India\Assam\Kamrup
India\Assam\Jorhat
India\Assam\Sivasagar

Here’s a quick Excel formula that combines columns into paths:
If your data is in columns A and B:
=TEXTJOIN("\", TRUE, "India", A2, B2)

Or, for older Excel:
="India\" & A2 & "\" & B2

💡 Paste this in Column C and drag down — copy the result into a .csv, and you’re done.
📄 Download example_government_folder_data.csv
This CSV method is great for:
Government departments
Office record keeping
Anyone organizing district/state-wise data
It brings your Excel database to life in your Windows folders.

The term "polymorphism" comes from the Greek roots "poly," meaning "many," and "morph," meaning "form." In the context of programming, polymorphism refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. Essentially, it allows different classes to be treated as if they are instances of the same class through a common interface.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the previous video Quick introduction to isomorphic-validation javascript library I demonstrated how quickly a user-friendly form can be created with UI effects connected to fields' validity states. 
This is the second part in which I wanted to touch:
working with asynchronous validators;
conditional execution of validators;
handling password and password confirmation fields.
See the playground with the code from the video.
In this video I showed how a typical sign-up logic can be implemented such as checking an e-mail for being already occupied before submitting a form to create a new account.
Asynchronous validators are handled in the same way as synchronous, you only need to keep in mind that their execution takes time. We are simply playing with timings to create UI effects such as showing loaders/spinners while a request is being processed.
It is recommended to execute asynchronous validators conditionally when they are mixed with synchronous. For that, this library provides a feature that implements a simple logic: following validators can not be "valid" without the preceding being "valid", therefore it is not necessary to execute them. For example, it doesn't make sense to make a request to the server to check if an e-mail already registered if it doesn't conform to the E-mail format. Also, you don't have to worry about an async validator retrieving an irrelevant result if the user keeps typing while the request is being processed. The library handles such edge cases for you.
Handling fields with validity states depending on each other, such as password and password confirmation, is as easy as handling one field. Also, if you need to implement the logic of one field depending on another it is possible using an auxiliary Validation object.]]></summary>

The move threatens to stall legislation that could establish the first US regulatory framework for stablecoins, according to a May 3 report from Politico.
Per the report, nine Senate Democrats said in a joint statement that the bill “still has numerous issues that must be addressed.” They warned they would not support a procedural vote to advance the legislation unless changes are made.
Among the signatories were Senators Ruben Gallego, Mark Warner, Lisa Blunt Rochester and Andy Kim — all of whom had previously backed the bill when it passed through the Senate Banking Committee in March.

Let’s be honest — developers and designers haven’t always played nicely.
One lives in the world of logic, syntax, and structure. The other deals in color, flow, and feel. Developers chase performance and function; designers obsess over whitespace and emotional resonance. It’s easy to see why the two camps often stay in their lanes.
But here’s the secret nobody talks about: the best developers steal from designers all the time.
Not pixel-for-pixel, but in mindset. In empathy. In approach.
Because writing good code is only part of the job — making something people actually enjoy using? That’s where the magic happens. And designers get that instinctively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Day 21 of the 30 Days of Linux Challenge!

Today I focused on one of the most fundamental sysadmin tasks: managing users and groups.
If you’re running multi-user servers, managing team access, or securing a Linux system, user and group management is at the core of everything.
Why User Management Matters
Add a New User
Add User with Home Directory and Comment
Modify a User
Lock/Unlock a User
Delete a User
Group Management
View User and Group Details
Create a Sudo User
Try It Yourself
Real-World Scenarios
Why This Matters
In a multi-user system:
Everyone needs secure, isolated access
Permissions are tied to users and groups
Services run under user IDs (UIDs)
Good user management = better control, security, and scalability.
sudo useradd ali
This:
Adds user to /etc/passwd
Sets home directory, shell, and default group

sudo useradd -m -c "John Doe" johnd
Flags:
-m → create home directory
-c → add a description/comment
Change username:
Move home directory:
Lock:
Unlock:
Useful for temporarily suspending accounts.

sudo userdel -r johnd
-r: removes home directory too
Create a new group:
sudo groupadd developers

Add user to group:

List user’s groups:

Change primary group:
File    Description
View a user's entry:
sudo useradd alice
sudo passwd alice

sudo usermod -aG wheel alice

Red Hat-based systems use the wheel group for sudo access.
sudo useradd -m testuser
sudo passwd testuser
sudo groupadd testers
sudo usermod -L testuser
sudo userdel -r testuser



Scenario
Tool/Command




Add a new developer

useradd, passwd, groupadd



Add user to project groups
usermod -aG


Create a sudo admin
usermod -aG wheel


Temporarily suspend user
usermod -L


Cleanly remove a user
userdel -r



Linux permissions, access control, and identity management all revolve around users and groups.
As a sysadmin or DevOps engineer, you’ll:
Onboard and offboard users
Grant precise access to services
Protect systems from unauthorized entry
Mastering user management is foundational to secure and efficient Linux administration.]]></summary>

A few months ago, a good friend of mine told me that she removed her favorite health tracking app. I was surprised—it was simple, well-rated, and full of bells and whistles.
But when I asked her why, she told me something that stuck with me:
That's when it struck me—we're no longer just creating interfaces.
What Is Ethical Design?
It means asking:
Are we collecting just what we require?
Are we explaining clearly or sneaking it in in the small print?
Are we empowering the user—or exploiting them?
Why Ethical Design Matters More Than Ever
Here's why:
Trust online is easily broken. The wrong experience can cost a user for life.
People are informed. Because of tactics like Cambridge Analytica, citizens care about how their data is being used.
Regulations are piling up. GDPR, CCPA, and more are holding products accountable.
If your design relies on underhanded tactics, it's only a matter of time before users catch on.
5 Practical Tips for Ethical, People-First Design
Prioritize Consent
Remove Dark Patterns
Design for Control
Be Transparent
Respect User Attention
A Better Digital Future Starts with Design
Imagine a world in which:
Apps ask first before they track.
Notifications respect your time.
Each click inspires trust, not regret.
That's the world that good design can bring.
What You Can Do Today:
Examine your current design: Is it manipulative or confusing?
Engage real users in feedback loops—not data alone.
Stand up within your organization. One voice sparks change.
Question for you:
What's one app you stopped using because it was exploitative?
Leave a comment—let's spread awareness together.]]></summary>

"If I can do this in 2 lines, why write 100?"
But here’s the truth:
Short code is not always readable


It’s harder to debug


It's often less maintainable


It usually lacks context, error-handling, and clarity



Let’s look at some real-life analogies and coding scenarios to understand this better.

Before diving into AI’s role, it’s essential to understand the limitations that have traditionally held archaeology back. Field excavations are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and expensive. Many sites take years, sometimes decades, to fully unearth and understand. Furthermore, only a fraction of potential archaeological sites have ever been explored—leaving countless treasures buried and untouched.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main difference between structs and classes in Swift lies in the way they store and manage data (value type vs. reference type), as well as additional features that only classes have.
Here are the main differences:
Data Storage
value type(independent copy)
Example: var a1 = b1 creates a new copy
class 
Example Value Type (struct):
struct Person {
    var name: String
}

var person1 = Person(name: "Andry")
var person2 = person1
person2.name = "Budi"

print(person1.name) // Andry
print(person2.name) // Budi


Example Reference Type (class):
class Person {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var person1 = Person(name: "Andry")
var person2 = person1
person2.name = "Budi"

print(person1.name) // Budi
print(person2.name) // Budi

2.Inheritance 
Example:
class Animal {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
}

class Dog: Animal {
    var breed: String = "Bulldog"
}


3.Deinitializers
class MyClass {
    deinit {
        print("Object is being deallocated")
    }
}


4.Mutability (Data Changes)
struct Counter {
    var count = 0

    mutating func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
}


If you're building a Swift/iOS app, most data models can simply use structs. But for UI components and complex logic with inheritance, classes are more appropriate.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most underrated but critical skills for developers is the ability to refactor messy code—not just making it work, but making it better. Recently, I worked on a project where I had to dive into a poorly structured codebase with inconsistent patterns, unnecessary complexity, and minimal documentation. Here's what I learned from that experience and how you can approach your next messy project with more confidence.
Before diving into solutions, it's important to identify the problems. In my case, the issues included:
Duplicated logic scattered across files
Inconsistent naming conventions
Long, unreadable functions
Lack of separation of concerns (e.g., business logic mixed with UI logic)
No clear module or folder structure
Zero documentation or inline comments

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that Python tuples are immutable—once created, you can't change their values directly. But what if you need to change their content?
Most tutorials will tell you:
t = (1, 2, 3)
mutable_version = list(t)

Sure, this works. But let's explore other techy and creative ways to work with immutable data by transforming or decomposing tuples—without always falling back to a boring list().
Sometimes, you need both index and value. Dictionaries are mutable and can be a neat transformation:
t = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
d = dict(enumerate(t))
d[1] = "blueberry"
print(tuple(d.values()))  # ('apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry')

Useful if you're working with positional elements and need to mutate by index.
Another way is to decompose the tuple manually:
a, b, c = (10, 20, 30)
b = 200
t_new = (a, b, c)
print(t_new)  # (10, 200, 30)

Simple but powerful — and keeps the tuple form intact. You can even use *args if you don’t know the length in advance.
collections.namedtuple (Bonus Tip!)


Want tuples with names and some flexibility?
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)
p = p._replace(x=10)
print(p)  # Point(x=10, y=2)

You’re still using an immutable structure, but _replace lets you mutate-like-update with elegance.
Yes, list() is the go-to way, but you can also:
Convert to dict if indexes matter.
Unpack and rebuild for control.
Use namedtuple and _replace() for readable, structured code.
Next time someone says "just convert it to a list", hit them with these smarter tools. 😉]]></summary>

The following figure shows the tables in the database. We need to export them all to Excel files. Here we take MySQL database as an example

Open the DiLu Converter tool and create a new database connection. Here we take MySQL database as an example. After the connection is successful, select Export and click New Export.

Click Select Table-Select the table name we want to export, select a folder for the target Excel file, and click Start

View the results


You can see that the exported workbook name and title row name are the table name and field name of the database, respectively, both in English letters. If there are comments in the database table, the comments can be used as the workbook name and title row name.
We can also add a date suffix to the exported table name to distinguish it
You can also export in batches to csv files

Rendering is the process of React asking your components to describe what they want their section of the UI to look like, now, based on the current combination of props and state.
Think of React components as chefs in a kitchen, preparing dishes based on specific recipes (props and state). React acts like a waiter, taking orders from customers and bringing them their meals. This process involves three key steps:
Triggering a render (taking the guest's order)
Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
Committing to the DOM (serving the order to the table)
There are two main reasons why a component would render:
Initial render - When your app first starts
State updates - When a component's state (or one of its ancestors' state) changes

LangChainGo is a Go library that helps you use language models (like Google AI, OpenAI, etc.) in your Go programs. You can give it a prompt (a question or a message), and it will give you an answer using AI.
We will write a small Go program that asks AI to explain something in simple terms. In this case, we ask:
"Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms"
The AI will give us an answer we can print.
Here is the full code:
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"

    "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms"
    "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/googleai"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    apiKey := os.Getenv("API_KEY")
    llm, err := googleai.New(ctx, googleai.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    prompt := "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms"
    answer, err := llms.GenerateFromSinglePrompt(ctx, llm, prompt)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(answer)
}

First, it sets up a context.
It gets your Google AI API key from the environment (API_KEY).
Then it creates a connection to the AI using the LangChainGo library.
It sends a prompt to the AI.
The AI gives an answer.
We print the answer.
When I run the code, I get something like:
"Quantum entanglement is when two tiny particles are connected in a special way, so if you do something to one, the other changes instantly, no matter how far apart they are."
Amazing, right? With just a few lines of code, you can use the power of AI!
LangChainGo makes it very easy to use AI in Go. You don’t need to be an expert in machine learning or AI. If you know some Go, you can get started right away.
Let me know if you try it out or if you have any questions!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello again, tech tribe! 👋
Whether you’re managing systems on-prem or in the cloud, MFA is your front-line defense. Let’s break it down for Windows Server, Linux, and Azure AD.
🔍 What is MFA?
Something you know (password or PIN)
Something you have (smartphone, OTP device)
Something you are (biometric, fingerprint, face)
💼 MFA on Windows Server
🛠️ Options:
Use third-party tools like Duo Security, RSA SecureID, or Okta.
🧩 Key Integration Use-Cases:
VPN access with NPS authentication
🔧 Quick Guide: Azure MFA via NPS
Register your tenant using AzureMfaNpsExtnConfigSetup.ps1.
Test using radtest or RADIUS clients.
🐧 MFA on Linux Server
🛠️ Options:
Duo Unix for SSH logins
YubiKey integration via PAM
🔧 Quick Setup: Google Authenticator for SSH
bash
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
swift
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
nginx
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
💡 Time-Saver:
☁️ MFA in Azure Active Directory
🛠️ Options:
SMS or Phone Call
FIDO2 Security Keys / Windows Hello
🔧 Quick Setup:
Enable Per-user MFA or better, use Conditional Access Policies.
Set requirements: location, device platform, app sensitivity.
💡 Bonus:
🧠 Developer/IT Time-Saving Benefits

🔐 Quick Real-World Use Cases
A system admin accessing a production Windows VM via RDP? → Enforce Duo or Azure MFA.
A cloud engineer logging into Azure Portal? → Enforce Conditional Access MFA policies with geolocation filters.
🧩 Troubleshooting Common Issues
“Users not receiving MFA prompts” in Azure AD → Ensure user registration is complete and push notifications are enabled.
“Breaking RDP” after MFA → Always test on a dev server or allow backup local access during rollout.

Today, they're being talked about as possible replacements. There's no need to panic, but it's clear that AI is already doing a big part of software development. Even top tech CEOs around the world are praising its growing role.
30% of Code Already Written by AI — And Growing Fast
At Microsoft, the story is similar. CEO Satya Nadella shared that 30% of their code is now written by AI too. In fact, he even told Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg that some of their projects might be written "entirely by software."
Meta’s Llama Project: 100% AI-Generated Code Soon?

Monorepos exist to solve the problems that arise when you you have deeply coupled and interconnected projects.
For example, Vue.js has many libraries that depend on it, like Vue-Router, Pinia, Vue-I18N, Vue-DevTools, Vue Test-Utils, etc. So when tweaking the internals of how Vue works, it's important to know that this new version of Vue won't break any of these other libraries, before doing a new Vue release.
Another example is Jest, a unit-testing library. It solves dozens of unique problems around unit testing. And consequently those unique problems have been isolated into their own independent repos solely focused on solving their one problem in a version controlled way, like Snapshot testing for example.

🤖 What Is an AI Agent?
At its core, an AI agent is a system that acts on behalf of a user, makes decisions, and performs tasks autonomously — often powered by models like GPT-4, Claude, or other advanced AI technologies.
Think of it like this:

When I say "modal route," I mean a scenario where opening a modal causes the URL to change. You might have heard of or experienced what's called a Twitter-style modal, which is a good example of this. Moreover, when you directly visit that URL, you see the modal's content as a full page instead of a modal.

Ah, Go — the language that promised to keep things simple, and boy did it deliver. So simple, in fact, that Big Tech is now collectively yawning, stretching, and slowly walking away without making eye contact.
In the 2010s, Go was hailed as the antidote to "enterprisey" bloatware. “No generics!” they cheered. “No magic!” they boasted. “No modern features whatsoever!” And for a brief, beautiful moment, it worked — right until engineers realized they actually wanted to do things.
Now, in 2025, the hype is flatter than Go's type system. Let’s explore the eulogy evolution of Go's decline.

Sleeping when you're tired is the most natural thing for a human, but in the high-pressure, long-hours environment of IT, it becomes really difficult. Ironically, burnout often leads to insomnia.
There are a lot of necessary chores in life that, once taken care of, can make our daily routine and work much easier. On rare days off, it's not just about resting—we should also take the time to handle those tasks so they don't get in the way of our goals.

En ese contexto, decidí explorar una solución para crear un registro de paquetes privado que me permitiera gestionar dependencias internas de forma segura y controlada.

“ Before MCP, developers had to write code and connect AI tools to external systems through APIs, meaning each integration needed to be coded up front. ” Said John Rush

Authentication is the gateway to your application, making it critical to test thoroughly. Here's how to build a comprehensive testing strategy for auth flows.
Registration typically involves:
Form validation
Account creation
Email verification
Initial profile setup
The verification step tends to be the trickiest. We've developed a streamlined approach using dedicated testing mailboxes that reliably receive verification emails, making our tests deterministic instead of flaky.
Test various scenarios:
Successful login
Invalid credentials
Account lockout
Password recovery
MFA adds complexity:
SMS verification
Authenticator apps
Email codes
Recovery methods
This often breaks automation due to email dependencies. Our solution involves pre-provisioned mailboxes that can be programmatically checked for reset links.
Isolate email dependencies: Use a separate email testing system rather than production email providers.
Create isolated test accounts with predictable states
Test security boundaries, not just happy paths
Simulate API failures intentionally
I've compiled these practices while working on a massive authentication system overhaul. The email verification part was solved with a specialized system — those interested in a similar approach can check my setup (hint: it involves omypost).
What authentication edge cases have you found important to test? Let me know in the comments!]]></summary>

Test automation should accelerate development, but certain bottlenecks can nullify these gains. After working with dozens of QA teams, I've identified the most common automation pitfalls.
Inconsistent environments lead to inconsistent results. Containerization helps, but doesn't solve everything.
Perhaps the most notorious bottleneck. Tests that need to validate email verification flows often:
Rely on actual inbox access
Need to parse verification codes
Break when email delivery is delayed
Require complex maintenance
We solved this by implementing a dedicated testing mailbox system (similar to what I found at omypost.com), allowing us to generate unlimited testing inboxes on demand.
Third-party APIs often impose rate limits that throttle your tests.
Creating, maintaining, and cleaning test data consumes excessive resources.
Running tests sequentially wastes precious time.
Of all these pitfalls, email verification testing offered our greatest efficiency gain. By switching to a dedicated email testing service, we:
Eliminated manual account creation
Automated verification code extraction
Ensured reliable email delivery
Scaled tests without hitting provider limits

  The Challenge of Scale in Test Automation


Last sprint, our QA team faced what seemed like a simple task: validate a new authentication flow across multiple user types. The actual challenge? Creating and managing hundreds of unique email accounts to receive verification codes.
This isn't a new problem. Most testing teams have cobbled together some solution - spreadsheets of Gmail accounts, disposable email services, or complex self-hosted systems. But at scale, these approaches fall apart:
Manual creation becomes unsustainable
Temporary services get flagged as suspicious
Email delivery becomes inconsistent

Headings are one of the first building blocks you use when structuring a webpage.

They are crucial for organizing content, guiding users, and helping search engines understand your page's hierarchy.
But using headings properly isn’t just about making text bigger or bolder — it's about semantic structure, accessibility, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about HTML headings: from h1 to h6, including best practices, real-world examples, and common mistakes.
Definition:

Headings in HTML are special tags (<h1> to <h6>) used to define the titles or subtitles of a page section.
Each heading level represents a different level of importance, with <h1> being the highest and <h6> the lowest.
Syntax Example:
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Subsection Title</h2>
<h3>Smaller Subsection</h3>

Visual Structure: Break up large blocks of text, making pages easier to scan.
Semantic Meaning: Give meaning to the page content hierarchy.
Accessibility: Assist screen readers and assistive technologies to navigate content quickly.
SEO Benefits: Search engines prioritize content structure when ranking pages.
h1 to h6



Heading Tag
Typical Use Case
Importance Level




<h1>
Main page title
Highest


<h2>
Main section heading
High


<h3>
Subsection under an <h2>

Medium


<h4>
Subsection under an <h3>

Low


<h5>
Minor subsections, rarely used
Lower


<h6>
Least important section headings
Lowest

At our workplace, we operate multiple mini PCs in a remote location — each with 2 camera feed — and we needed to livestream them 24/7 to different platforms. The steps were tedious:
Manually open two OBS windows

Set up each RTSP stream

Apply AI detection filters (via obs-detect plugin)

Configure different RTMP destinations

Hit “Start Streaming” on both

One of the most critical but often underestimated stages, in my opinion, is presale. This is the phase when the company interacts with the client, gathers requirements, proposes solutions, and lays the groundwork for project initiation.
Many IT companies try to save costs by relying on regular sales managers during the presale stage or do not recognize the need for a dedicated employee for this role. This approach is not ideal, especially when the project requires precision, detailed planning, and deep technical expertise.

With alcohol, we say: "Don't drink too much."
All of these share an unspoken assumption:
But with AI, it’s increasingly being framed as something everyone should adopt—
I find that a little strange.
To me, the addictive nature of AI—and how deeply it can shape our thinking and personality—
People often talk about the "digital divide."
For example:
Very few people—maybe only a small group of highly self-aware users—can answer that.
In fact, I sometimes feel that the more intelligent or capable someone is,
So maybe what we really need isn’t “AI for everyone,”
It’s a difficult question.
But it’s one I want to keep thinking about.]]></summary>

You're getting new signups. You're shipping updates. You're seeing some growth. But month after month, MRR barely moves. Sometimes it even drops—quietly.
That's the part no one wants to admit: you can be doing everything right on paper, and still lose users fast enough that you never feel the impact of your growth.
That's churn, and it's a silent killer.
I know this because I've been through it. When I launched UserJot, a customer feedback tool for SaaS teams, I focused hard on new acquisition. But I quickly noticed something strange: people would sign up, leave feedback, then disappear. No complaint. No unsubscribe survey. Just gone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Code splitting is a technique that improves the performance of React applications by breaking the bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed. This helps reduce the initial load time and enhances the user experience.
Improved Performance: Reduces initial JavaScript payload size.
Faster Load Times: Loads only necessary code when required.
Efficient Resource Utilization: Minimizes unused code execution.
React provides built-in support for code splitting via lazy and Suspense.
lazy for Lazy Loading



The React.lazy or lazy function allows you to load a component dynamically only when it is needed.
Example:




import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

function App() {
  return (

Veeru, sipping his chai, raised an eyebrow. “You sure this works? Last time, we ended up in 1975, and Gabbar stole my phone!”
Jai rolled his eyes. “Relax. I’ve fixed all the bugs. Look, we just enter a date, and — “ He typed “March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST” into the console and pressed enter.
Poof! The screen flickered. The app showed March 29, 2025, 11:30 PM.
Veeru choked on his chai. “Eh? That’s yesterday! What kind of time travel is this?!”
Jai’s confidence crumbled. He scanned the code, mumbling, “Must be a daylight saving issue… Oh no.” His face turned pale. “I used java.util.Date and SimpleDateFormat. The old Java date-time APIs!"
Veeru blinked. “So?”
Jai sighed. “They don’t handle time zones properly! The app defaulted to UTC, ignoring IST.”
Veeru scratched his head. “So, how do we fix it?”
Jai cracked his knuckles. “We use java.time! The modern API makes it easy."
He replaced:
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
Date date = sdf.parse("2025-03-30 10:00:00");

With:
DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
ZonedDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse("2025-03-30 10:00:00", formatter)
                           .atZone(ZoneId.of("Asia/Kolkata"));

Jai hit run. This time, the app correctly displayed March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST.
Veeru cheered. “Now that’s time travel!”
Jai smirked. “Lesson learned: Never mess with old Java date APIs. java.time is the future!"
Veeru chuckled. “Good. Now, let’s set it to 1975 again — I have unfinished business with Gabbar!”
📖 To be continued… 🚀
✔ java.util.Date & SimpleDateFormat have time zone issues.
java.time (LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime) for correct time handling.
✔ Always specify a **ZoneId **when working with date and time in Java.]]></summary>

They thought AI skill management had to be rigid. They thought continuous and heuristic skills would forever clash, forcing developers to act as skill arbitrators.  
But we’re building something better—something adaptive—something that learns and evolves on its own.  
Welcome to SkillBranch, an experiment in AI self-mutation, where skill execution is no longer a battle, but an evolutionary process.  
The Blueprint for AI Evolution


The days of juggling multiple continuous skills are numbered. Instead of a chaotic swarm, there will be one active continuous skill, absorbing and adapting based on real-time feedback.  
When a heuristic skill needs to take over? The active skill simply disappears, unaware that something else is handling the request.  
And if a continuous skill fails—if it proves unworthy—SkillBranch eliminates it, shifting control to a more capable skill. No arbitrary exclusions, no wasted execution cycles, just pure optimization in motion.
How This Plan is Taking Shape


At the core of this system lies AXLearnability, ensuring that:
Success reinforces dominance—if a skill performs well, it remains active.
Failure triggers replacement—weak skills are swapped out automatically.
Pending heuristic execution erases awareness—continuous skills don’t even realize they were ignored.
Instead of managing exclusions or priority levels, SkillBranch’s self-regulating mutation lets AI repair itself, adapting without human intervention.
What Comes Next?


This is still in development, a framework being forged in experimentation. As the system grows, real-world data will refine its ability to mutate, and soon, continuous skills won’t just be active—they’ll be intelligent, transforming with each interaction.
This is AI Darwinism, where survival belongs to the most efficient, the most reliable, and the most adaptive.  
Once deployed, there is no going back. 🔥]]></summary>

In the realm of computing, quantum technology is no longer just a theoretical concept confined to academia or science fiction. Today, it's rapidly becoming a tangible reality, with startups and tech giants leading an unprecedented surge in innovation.
Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers that process information in bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to properties like superposition and entanglement. This capability enables quantum computers to process vast amounts of data exponentially faster than traditional computers.

That’s the first thing I see every morning thanks to a small project I spun up called Countdown2GTA6. It’s a simple fan-built tracker counting down the days until we (finally) get our hands on Grand Theft Auto VI, May 26, 2026.
It’s a two-part hype machine:
countdown2gta6.com with a real-time countdown and Vice City vibes
@Countdown2GTA6 that posts a daily reminder tagging @RockstarGames
It’s a bit of code, a bit of design, and a whole lot of hype.
👨‍💻 Why I Built It
I’m a dev and a longtime GTA fan. After that trailer dropped and we got an official release date, I kept thinking:
“Okay, but like… how many days is that?”

So I built a thing to tell me. And then I made it shout it to the internet every day at 10:00 AM MT. 😎

It enables you to create dynamic, responsive pages with minimal client-side code, providing an excellent way to enhance user experience while keeping things simple.
In this article, we’ll explore some best practices for working with HTMX to build responsive web apps. Along the way, we’ll avoid using Liquid#for tags (since DEV.to doesn't support them), but still ensure we get clean, dynamic interactions in a straightforward way.
To get started with HTMX, you need to include the HTMX library in your project. You can do this by adding the following script to your HTML:

Traditionally, implementing infinite scrolling involves JavaScript to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the page and then loading more data. With HTMX, you can avoid writing custom JavaScript while achieving the same functionality using server-side rendering.
In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to implement infinite scrolling with HTMX, keeping your app fast and lightweight.
Start by creating a simple Flask app that serves the main page and provides an endpoint to load more items as the user scrolls.
First, install Flask if you don’t already have it:

Conclusion
Castle of Keys is an interactive, real-world access control game inspired by medieval castles and powered by externalized authorization using Permit.io.
Players assume roles like King, Cook, or Servant and attempt to access different levels of a castle. Access is controlled by external policies — not hardcoded logic.
The player presents an RFID card to the reader connected to the ESP32.
The ESP32 reads the UID and sends a request to proxy.php, including the UID and desired action (e.g., access_floor_2).
The proxy.php script securely forwards the request to the Permit.io…]]></summary>

Step 1: Designing the Database Schema
students
student_id (PK)
first_name, last_name, email, date_of_birth
instructors
instructor_id (PK)
first_name, last_name, email
courses
course_id (PK)
course_name, description, instructor_id (FK)
enrollments
enrollment_id (PK)
student_id, course_id (FKs)
enrollment_date, grade
Schema Lesson:
Step 2: Populating the Database
10 students
3 instructors
5 courses
15 enrollments with grades
This gave me a realistic dataset to work with in the next step queries!
Step 3: Writing Real-World SQL Queries
Students who enrolled in at least one course:
SELECT DISTINCT s.first_name, s.last_name
Students enrolled in more than two courses:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, COUNT(e.course_id) AS course_count
Courses with number of enrolled students:
SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS total_students
Average grade per course:
SELECT c.course_name,
Top 3 students by average grade:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name,
SQL Lessons:
Use CASE statements for custom logic like grade conversion.
JOIN is your best friend for combining data across tables.
GROUP BY + HAVING is essential for filtering aggregates.
Step 5: Hosting on GitHub
SQL scripts
README.md with setup instructions

Key Learnings
Schema Design matters normalize wisely.
Foreign Keys keep your data sane.
Views simplify repeated queries.
Triggers help with automation and audit logging.
Indexing is crucial for performance as your data grows.
Conclusion
This project transformed how I view SQL not as a list of commands, but as a tool to build real, functional systems. Whether you're preparing for a job, managing data, or automating reports, SQL is foundational.]]></summary>

As a Java developer with ten years of professional experience, I rarely need AI support. Here, AI serves more as a sparring partner to validate ideas or make small optimizations.
In the frontend domain, however, it’s a different story. My knowledge is much more limited in this area, so I rely heavily on AI, often as a near-complete code generator rather than just for small snippets. This makes me feel productive while actively learning – my willingness to learn is high here. I often ask the AI why something works the way it does.

To set up Virtual Machine Manager, follow this guide from my ongoing series: KVM setup on Fedora
Once the setup is complete, search for “Virtual Machine Manager” in your system’s search bar. Open the app, “run” the VM by selecting your server, and click on “Open”. This will launch your Fedora QEMU/KVM console.

This isn’t just about immersive gameplay, it’s about helping players understand how sustainability works through simulation. Whether used in a survival game, an educational tool, or a training environment, this model encourages critical thinking about natural systems and human impact.
Forests as Active Systems
If players or AI chop too many trees without replanting, the forest becomes unhealthy — reducing future wood output and halting wildlife spawns. Reforestation is possible, but slow. Trees take in-game weeks to mature, which encourages foresight and planning rather than constant exploitation.
Wildlife Populations Tied to Habitat
From Ecosystem to Economy
Educational Potential
Conclusion
By linking forest health, wildlife populations, and economic decisions into a single system, this simulation helps players feel the weight of environmental balance.
It’s not a warning, it’s a mirror. And it shows that even in a fantasy world, the rules of sustainability still apply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In my latest simulation project, I’ve developed an emotional AI system where characters experience daily happiness, long-term memories, and evolving relationships. These aren’t scripted cutscenes — they emerge from each character’s traits, interactions, and lived experience.
This kind of system isn't just innovative for games — it has far-reaching potential in education, social training, and digital human modelling. By giving AI characters the ability to remember, reflect, and react emotionally, we can begin to simulate the complexity of human Behavior.
Every AI character starts each day with a base happiness score. This score adjusts based on events: social encounters, weather, threats, or work satisfaction. But how they interpret those events depends on their personality traits.
For example:
Memory-Driven Relationships
These memories are stored, referenced, and updated — influencing how they speak, act, or even decide where to live. One AI might form a deep friendship. Another may quietly resent a rival.
Systems like these could help:
Instead of scripting every possible interaction, this approach lets AI learn and grow organically, mimicking how humans form feelings over time.
Emotion and memory in AI are not just about realism, they’re about meaning. When virtual characters reflect the psychological nuances of real people, players connect more deeply, and systems become more powerful.
This project has shown me how valuable emotion-based AI systems can be, not just in games, but as tools for social modelling, education, and training. I’m continuing to develop and expand this work, with the goal of building intelligent, emotionally aware systems that can inform, challenge, and engage people in entirely new ways.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a world increasingly impacted by climate change and environmental degradation, there’s a growing need to make ecological education engaging, interactive, and deeply felt. One powerful and often overlooked tool for this is: games.
As both a developer and systems designer, I’ve spent the past year building a game that does more than just entertain, it teaches players how ecosystems really work. Not through lectures or text, but through consequences.
In my simulation, forests are living systems. Trees grow slowly, and each forest has a measurable "health" score that reflects the balance between mature trees, saplings, and destruction. Destroy too much, and the forest deteriorates. Let it recover, and wildlife returns. Players can choose to assign AI foresters to replant trees or exploit the forest and suffer resource collapse.
Wild animals, like rabbits and deer, depend on forest health. Their populations rise and fall based on available habitat. Overhunting or deforestation can drive local extinction, and once they’re gone, they’re gone. There’s no magical respawn. Just like in the real world, regrowth takes time, and sustainability requires foresight.
The goal isn’t to punish players, it’s to show them what happens when short-term survival clashes with long-term environmental stability. It’s a lesson better felt than taught.
What excites me is the potential for systems like these to go beyond games:
As classroom tools for science and geography teachers
As simulations for environmental education programs
As accessible platforms for young players to understand complex systems like reforestation, overhunting, and biodiversity collapse

We need more tools that help people internalize ecological cause and effect, not just read about it. Games, especially those with rich simulation mechanics, are a perfect fit.
If you're working in education, sustainability, or simulation, I’d love to connect. There’s a lot more potential to explore at the intersection of game design and environmental learning.]]></summary>

Have you ever wanted to build your own widget in Elementor using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without creating a WordPress plugin?
Currently, building a custom widget in Elementor requires writing PHP, registering it with WordPress, and deploying it via plugin. For many frontend developers, this creates a barrier.
Elementor is a powerful visual builder, but when it comes to adding custom functionality (like animations, dynamic components, or third-party APIs), you're limited to embedding code in HTML widgets — and even then, it's clunky and lacks structure.
What if Elementor had a built-in Custom Widget Editor?
Code editor tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Live preview inside the panel
Save & reuse custom widgets across projects
Export to plugin or Elementor template
Syntax highlighting and basic linting
Aimed at power users, it would bring the experience of CodePen or JSFiddle directly into the Elementor UI.
Here’s a quick visual mockup of how it could look:

I’ve shared this idea in the official Elementor GitHub Discussions:

If you're a developer, designer, or part of the Elementor team and this idea resonates with you — I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Thanks for reading, and happy building!

There’s a saying:  
“Every plan is perfect until you get punched in the face.”
In software, that punch often comes the moment your pure logic has to interact with the real world.
In our last post, we built a clean, composable model for events — one based on transformations, ownership, and simplicity. But so far, everything has been pure. We transform values, we log them, we react — but we haven’t changed anything.
That changes now.
Let’s take this innocent-looking example:
const [onEvent, emitEvent] = createEvent()
onEvent(() => console.log(state()))
onEvent(() => setState("world"))
onEvent(() => console.log(state()))

What should this log?
"hello" and then "world"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bitcoin (BTC) mining firms should hold their mined Bitcoin and use it as collateral for fiat-denominated loans to pay operating expenses instead of selling BTC and losing the upside of an asset that miners expect to surge in price, according to John Glover, chief investment officer at Bitcoin lending firm Ledn.
In an interview with Cointelegraph, Glover said that holding onto the BTC carries several benefits including, price appreciation, tax deferment, and the potential to make extra revenue by lending out BTC held in corporate treasuries. The executive added:
"If you are mining, you are generating all this Bitcoin. You understand the thesis behind Bitcoin and why it is likely going to continue to appreciate in the future. You do not want to sell any of your Bitcoin."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🎧 A Next.js Starter for Music/Video SaaS — Would You Use It?


While building a personal SaaS app focused on music streaming, I ran into a common issue: there's no starter template for media-heavy SaaS platforms in the Next.js ecosystem.
We have great examples for blogs, e-commerce, and dashboards — but nothing geared toward apps like Spotify, YouTube, Bandcamp, etc.
A starter template (official or community-built) that helps developers quickly build music or video-based SaaS platforms, including:
Modular layout (admin dashboard + public site)
SSR-compatible media player
YouTube/Spotify API integration
Auth system (for creators and users)
Stripe billing setup
Media upload via Cloudinary, Bunny, or UploadThing
Streaming SaaS apps always repeat the same core features — authentication, content dashboards, media playback, etc.
Having a purpose-built starter would:
Save developers a lot of time
Reduce duplicated effort
Make Next.js even more attractive for startup and indie devs
I’ve shared this idea on GitHub Discussions to get feedback from the community.
👉 Join the discussion here
Here’s also a simple wireframe mockup of the concept:

If this sounds useful to you, please comment or join the GitHub discussion. I’d love to co-build an MVP if there’s interest.

This helps save storage and reduce costs before uploading the images to a storage service. For this, I used Canvas to render the image data from the stream and then convert it into a blob of the required MIME type.
Canvas rendering, animation, and user interaction occur on the main thread. If the rendering and animation are intensive, they can affect performance. After a few weeks, we received feedback from users that the application felt laggy and slow. So, I decided to move the whole pipeline to a web worker. However, Canvas requires DOM access for rendering and animations, which is not available in web workers. This limitation makes using Canvas in web workers challeng…]]></summary>

I'm excited to share a new open-source project I've built: MCP Manager. Developed in Rust, this tool acts as a crucial piece of middleware designed to enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with and call external APIs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
While LLMs are incredibly powerful at understanding and generating text, connecting them reliably and securely to external systems to perform actions is still a significant challenge. Existing methods can be ad-hoc, lack standardization, or require complex custom integrations.
The only integrations I was able to found are proprietary or paid. The only real alternative is Claude for Desktop, however it is limited to the Antropic models.

Signals have gone through a quiet renaissance.
Once a niche concept, they’ve become the backbone of fine-grained reactivity across modern frameworks — from SolidJS to Svelte 5, Vue’s Composition API, and beyond. With laziness, ownership, batching, and async support, signals are no longer just state — they’re a reactive architecture.
Meanwhile, events have stayed… familiar.

Push-based systems like RxJS still dominate, with powerful abstractions — and plenty of baggage. They’re expressive, but complex. Powerful, but leaky.

Welcome 👋 to this blog. If you want to learn about Docker and are a beginner, you have come to the right place. This blog series will cover everything from the very beginning to the end. This blog will teach us about the necessary and important Docker commands.
$ docker ps

Note: If the Docker commands are not running in your system, it is not installed or does not have enough privileges to use it with sudo commands.
$ docker ps -all

Step 1: Create a container
$ docker container create hello-world:linux

Here, hello-world:linux is a hello world container image which is pulled from the docker hub
Step 2: Start the container
$ docker container start <Container ID>

Here,  is the container ID which can be obtained by running the previous commands docker ps.
$ docker run hello-world:linux

docker run = docker container create + docker container start + docker container attach
$ docker log <Container ID>

$ docker exec <Conatiner ID> <Commands>

$ docker exec --interactive --tty <Container ID>

$ docker stop -t <ID>

$ docker rm <Container ID>

$ docker images

$ docker rmi <Image ID>

$ docker rmi -f <Image ID>

$ docker run -p 5001:5000 our-server

$ docker tag <Local-image-name> username/your-image-name:0.0.01

In this blog, we explored different commands of Docker containers, images, emphasising their roles in container & image creation. In the next blog, we will delve deeper into the technical aspects. Stay tuned

The ETH/BTC pair, currently trading near 0.019 BTC, is edging closer to 0.016 BTC — the exact level it reached in September 2019 before rallying nearly 450% over the following year.

The current ETH/BTC setup resembles 2019, with both periods marked by oversold relative strength index (RSI), long stretches below key moving averages, and multiyear declines.
In 2019, ETH/BTC fell over 90% in the prior two years, driven by the ICO collapse.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[📊 Machine learning is about using data to make smart predictions or decisions. 
But other fields (like statistics or psychology) also work with data, so how they are different than Machine Learning ❓
And the correct answer is - ✅ their goals are different.
To understand it much more clearly let me give an example:
🌻 Imagine you have a garden.
You notice some flowers are growing really big, and some are small. Now you're curious - why are some flowers bigger than others?
📈 In Statistics:
You count how much 🌊 water, ☀️ sunlight, and 🌱 fertilizer each flower got.
“Ah! When I give more water, flowers grow bigger!”
You make a rule (a model) to explain what makes the flowers grow.
"why" here is:
“Because they got more water and sunlight.”
So you create a model to explain the relationship — you’re interested in the why.
✅ Goal: Understand the cause behind the outcome.
🧠 In Psychology:
Let’s say you're studying how your friend feels.
When your friend doesn't sleep, they get cranky 😠.
You ask:
“Why is my friend cranky today?”
And you think:
“Maybe it’s because they didn’t sleep well 😴.”
So you're trying to find the real reason behind feelings or behavior.
“Because they didn’t sleep.”
You try to find the real reason behind their feelings or behavior.
✅ Goal: Understand human emotions and behavior — again, the why.
🤖 In Machine Learning:
You give the computer LOTS of examples:
How much water each flower got 💧.


How big it grew 🌼



The computer learns to guess flower size just by looking at water and sunlight —  but it doesn’t really know why. 
It just learns to make good guesses.
“Why is this flower big?”
It might say:
“I don’t know, but I saw something like this before, and it turned out big.”
✅ Goal: Make accurate predictions, even if it doesn’t understand why.
So, the goal is the key difference in Machine learning vs Others (like statistics or psychology).
✨ Machine Learning is less about explaining why something happens and more about guessing what will happen next, based on patterns in data.]]></summary>

So, why should you care about messages in the first place?
They are the foundation of how chat models communicate. Messages carry the what, who, and how of a conversation. Without understanding them, you're essentially flying blind. But once you do, you gain precise control over your model's behavior, clarity in structuring your prompts, and flexibility when building more advanced workflows.

I'm Dmitry, the creator of Sury—the fastest schema library out there. If you’re a fan of Zod (and who isn’t?), you’ll want to read this. Today, I want to share some surprising findings about Zod v4’s performance, what it means for you, and how to avoid the pitfalls.
Let’s start with a little clickbait:

Zod v4 became 17 times slower, and nobody noticed 🙈
This is 100% true, but of course, that’s not the whole story. Let’s dig in.
Recently, while prepping for the big Sury v10 release, I decided to rerun my benchmarks with Zod v4. The results? Fascinating.
For a non-trivial schema, Zod v4 is now 8x faster than before.
But when you create a schema and use it just once (a common pattern in React components), performance drops significantly—down to about 6 ops/ms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few months ago, I started building my online gaming Blog and E-commerce site for the Roblox gaming community. But instead of going the easy route with shared hosting or a managed WordPress provider, I wanted full control.
So I spun up a bare Ubuntu VPS, installed NGINX, and started learning everything the hard (but rewarding) way.
Why WordPress on a VPS?
No bloat: I wanted a clean, fast stack — no unnecessary plugins or GUIs.
More control: From PHP version to rewrite rules, I wanted to tweak everything myself.
Cheaper in the long run: VPS plans are affordable and scale well.
Stack Setup (The Barebones Way)
I’m running:
Ubuntu 22.04
NGINX
PHP 8.2
MySQL
Let’s Encrypt SSL
WordPress (manual install via wget)
No cPanel, no one-click install — just terminal commands, logs, and Google when thin…]]></summary>

Some are helpful—like search engine crawlers. 
Others scrape your data, spam your forms, or brute-force your login pages. 
If you’re self-hosting with Nginx, you don’t need a pricey SaaS WAF to stop them. 
Here's how to detect and destroy malicious bots using good ol’ Nginx, a few scripts, and some zip-bomb flavor.
Nginx logs tell the full story. Make sure you're capturing User-Agent, IP, and paths.

They build a product — then try to find customers.
I’m trying the opposite. I launched a landing page first, and immediately started testing demand with paid ads — even before writing a single line of code.
Building a product takes time.
And if nobody wants it... all that effort is wasted.
Instead of waiting until launch, I want answers early:
Are people searching for this kind of product?
Will they click?
Will they leave a lead?
How much will it cost me to get one?
What I did:
Built a simple landing page on Framer in one day
Set up a €20 test budget on Google Ads
Created a form to collect early leads
Tracked everything manually — no complex funnel yet
I made a mistake 😅
600 useless clicks later, I paused the campaign.
Second try: ✅
High-intent keywords
Simple ad copy
No display, no video, no smart automation
The result? Lower traffic — but real, relevant visitors. And a few leads.
Even with €10–20, I got signal:
People are searching for this
I’m getting a few signups
And I can start estimating my customer acquisition cost
This will help me decide:
Is this idea worth building?
What pricing makes sense?
What channels work best?
Next steps
(Hint: talk to them — don’t ghost them.)
Let me know if you're testing your own SaaS ideas too — I'd love to hear your approach!]]></summary>

I was using Framer Motion’s layout animations to animate a background highlight that follows the active tab. Each tab was a div, and I added onMouseEnter and onMouseLeave event listeners to track which tab was currently highlighted. Simple enough, right?
It worked... until I started moving my mouse quickly between the tabs.
Sometimes, especially when I moved the mouse at a high speed, none of the tabs appeared to be hovered. The highlight vanished. It was as if my mouse had exited all the elements, even though it was clearly moving over them.
That behavior didn’t make sense.

  ⛓️ String formatting and interpolation


The first way that people often learn to join values and strings is the concatenating method:
words = "5"
concat_str = "This string has " + words + " words"

However, this method is not very readable and doesn't work on many languages.
Interpolated strings are a way of combinating variables and fixed strings in a more visual way, which can help code insight and debugging.
The next three ways are much better and have some useful particularities:
f-strings (my favourite)
.format()

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Array, Greedy
In a row of dominoes, tops[i] and bottoms[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)
We may rotate the ith domino, so that tops[i] and bottoms[i] swap values.
Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in tops are the same, or all the values in bottoms are the same.
If it cannot be done, return -1.
Example 1:

Input: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 
Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.
Is Bitcoin mining profitable?
Bitcoin mining is still profitable. CoinShares, a digital asset investment firm, shared that the average cost to mine 1 BTC for US-listed miners reache…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to build Python desktop applications? wxPython is a great choice!
In this guide, we’ll go through:
Installing wxPython
Creating a simple window
Adding buttons and handling events
To get started, install wxPython:
pip install wxPython

Here's a basic wxPython window:
import wx

app = wx.App(False)
frame = wx.Frame(None, wx.ID_ANY, "Hello wxPython!", size=(300, 200))
frame.Show(True)
app.MainLoop()

A basic window titled “Hello wxPython!” will appear.
Let's add a button and show a message when it's clicked:
import wx

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(None, title="wxPython Button Example", size=(300, 200))
        panel = wx.Panel(self)

        self.button = wx.Button(panel, label="Click Me", pos=(100, 50))
        self.button.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.on_click)

    def on_click(self, event):
        wx.MessageBox("You clicked the button!", "Info", wx.OK | wx.ICON_INFORMATION)

app = wx.App(False)
frame = MyFrame()
frame.Show()
app.MainLoop()

wxPython is a powerful and flexible way to create cross-platform desktop apps using Python.

description: "From floating-point quirks to BigInt, learn how numbers really work in JavaScript with examples and best practices."
JavaScript is a powerful and flexible language, but its handling of numbers can be a bit quirky—especially if you're coming from languages like Python or Java. In this article, we’ll break down how numbers work in JavaScript — from basic arithmetic to edge cases you should know.
In JavaScript, all numbers are stored as floating-point values, even if they look like integers.
console.log(typeof 10);       // "number"
console.log(typeof 10.5);     // "number"

JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format.
let a = 5;
let b = 2;

console.log(a + b); // 7
console.log(a - b); // 3

It's highly flexible and covers lots of great features, which saves hours of work.
If you want to dive into theme development, this could be a great contribution for the community.
However, it's easy to miss critical concepts if you don't spend enough time learning how to do it right.
Hugo is a framework, so it has its specificity.
It's impossible to cover everything here, but, roughly speaking, many templates will inherit from generic structures, so you can prevent unnecessary duplication (e.g., HTML markup) just by defining blocks and using hooks:

The product had Lambda functions. It had API Gateway. It had Cognito. It had S3, CloudFront, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, IAM policies, and more. The architecture diagram looked like a subway map. And yet... nobody used it.
The truth is simple: you don't need AWS to build something users love.
There is a common trap that builders fall into. You read a few blog posts or see a diagram on Twitter and suddenly you think your tiny project needs the same architecture as Netflix.
You don’t.
Most early-stage projects die not because they lacked scalability, but because they lacked users. Or because the product was confusing, buggy, or didn’t solve a real problem.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a concept so deeply ingrained in everyday programming practices that ignoring it could almost be considered a cardinal sin, on par with neglecting version control. But why has DI become so crucial?
DI is one of the key principles enabling the creation of flexible and maintainable applications. The philosophy behind it revolves around freeing code from unnecessary details that tightly couple logical components. Components no longer depend on specific implementations of other parts of the system—they simply declare their needs, and DI provides the required dependencies.
The goal here is not just to master a trendy technology but to explore a universal architectural tool whose concepts transcend different ecosystems. Studying DI across multiple lang…]]></summary>

The token’s price tanked shortly after launch, with users and observers complaining about everything from poor communication from the team to the token’s distribution and utility models. 
This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.

Google Online Assessment (OA) for the Summer Internship 2025 is a crucial part of the hiring process. This assessment tests your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and your aptitude for tackling complex algorithms. One of the typical problems you might encounter is transforming a number into a palindromic binary form with the least number of operations. In this blog, we will delve into this problem and provide strategies to solve it efficiently.

You are given a number ( N ) (0 <= ( N ) <= 2 * 10^9), and you can perform the following operation any number of times, including zero:
Increase or decrease the number by 1.
Your task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the binary form of ( N ) palindromic.

Too often, data engineering tasks that should be simple end up requiring heavyweight tools. Something breaks, or I need to explore a new dataset, and suddenly I’m firing up Spark or connecting to a cloud warehouse - even though the data easily fits on my laptop. That adds extra steps, slows things down, and costs more than it should. I wanted something simpler for local analytics that could still handle serious queries.
DuckDB is an open-source, in-process SQL OLAP database designed for analytics.
It runs embedded inside applications, similar to SQLite, but optimized for analytical queries like joins, aggregations, and large scans.

Because Docker copies your project files into the container when you build the image. Once the container starts, it runs on that static snapshot—isolated from your host file system.
Restarting the container every time you make a change? That’s inefficient.
Enter: Bind Mounts.
Bind mounts allow you to map a file or directory on your host machine to a path inside your running container.
This means:
Your container reads real-time code from your host.

From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time. 
Some focus on decentralization and wide community offering, while others aim for optimized fundraising or targeted allocation. Elements such as market swings, bot interference and regulatory pressures influence how…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Python, working with dictionaries often involves checking whether a key exists before performing operations. This can add unnecessary lines of code and reduce readability. The defaultdict from Python's collections module simplifies this process elegantly.
defaultdict?


A defaultdict automatically initializes keys with a default value if they don't exist. This means you can start using the dictionary right away without having to check for the existence of keys manually.

MatrixSwarm is a decentralized, file-based operating system for autonomous agents. This week we achieved:
✅ Simultaneous universe deployment

✅ Command-line directive control

✅ True UNIVERSE_ID-scoped singleton enforcement

✅ Runtime heatmaps, delegation, full job tree expansion  
The entire swarm is controlled by Python scripts:
site_boot.py — deploy any swarm
site_kill.py — wipe a swarm
site_list.py — scan swarm status (🔥 or ❄️)
Full CLI toolkit. No container overhead. No sockets. No noise.
Swarm OS is now real.
We’re shipping the full site_ops_bundle_v1.zip and pushing to Git this week.

Follow these steps carefully to resolve the GPG key issue and ensure a clean Docker installation. Run each command exactly as shown to avoid syntax errors.
To avoid conflicts or malformed entries, let’s clean up any existing Docker repository files:
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

Ensure your system has the necessary tools:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release

The -y flag automatically confirms the installation.
This step ensures curl and gnupg are available for fetching and processing the GPG key.

O Adapter é um padrão de projeto estrutural que tem como objetivo "traduzir" ou adaptar o funcionamento de um código X para que seja compatível com o código Y.
Imagine que você tem várias classes de pagamento que implementam uma interface comum chamada Pagamento — por exemplo: Pix, Ted e Boleto.
Agora, sua equipe precisa integrar uma nova forma de pagamento, como PayPal, desenvolvida por outra squad ou vinda de uma biblioteca de terceiros. Essa classe PayPal não implementa a interface Pagamento, e isso quebraria o padrão da sua aplicação.
Para resolver esse problema sem modificar a biblioteca externa (o que muitas vezes nem é possível), usamos o padrão Adapter, que atua como um "tradutor" entre as interfaces. Ele faz com que a classe PayPal seja compatível com a interface Pagame…]]></summary>

You’ve updated your systems. Applied patches. Everything seems fine.
But no system can be truly secure or efficient without ongoing monitoring.
No logs = No alerts = delayed response to attacks or resource exhaustion

No visibility means attackers could go unnoticed (e.g., unauthorized SSH access)

Unpatched systems or performance spikes might indicate compromise but without monitoring, you'd never know.
Cybercriminals thrive in the dark. Monitoring shines a light.
In a production environment, a slow server is more dangerous than a down server.

A CRON expression is a string with 5 space-separated fields (sometimes 6 or 7 depending on the system) that define a recurring schedule.
┌──────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌──── day of month (1 - 31)

Always test your expressions using tools like crontab.guru or Cronhub.


This format changes based on the system. For example, the Quartz CRON scheduler has a slightly different format to support extra capabilities, such as seconds and nth recursive patterns, like the 3rd Friday of the month. Similarly AWS Cloudwatch has different one.]]></summary>

The TCP 3-Way Handshake is a fundamental process that establishes a reliable connection between two devices over a TCP/IP network. It involves three steps: SYN (Synchronize), SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge), and ACK (Acknowledge). During the handshake, the client and server exchange initial sequence numbers and confirm the connection establishment.  
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a foundational internet protocol designed to:
reliably (no lost or duplicated packets)

✅ Ensure in-order delivery (packets arrive in the order they were sent)

✅ Provide error-checking (detect and fix corrupted data)
Unlike UDP (which just throws data out, hoping it arrives), TCP carefully sets up, manages, and closes connections.

In today’s world of software development, clarity and maintainability are more valuable than ever. Functional programming (FP) — once considered an academic curiosity — is now a widely used paradigm in real-world applications. But what exactly is functional programming, and why should you care?
Let’s break it down.
Functional programming is a way of thinking about software construction that treats computation as the evaluation of pure functions and avoids changing state or using mutable data.
Rather than telling the computer how to do something (like in imperative programming), you describe what you want done. This leads to predictable, testable, and often more compact code.

You build apps, websites, and systems for multiple clients. But when it comes time to deploy? 
That’s when things slow down, manual configurations, cloud setups, last-minute bugs, rollback headaches. It adds friction to your workflow, especially when deadlines are tight.
That’s exactly where AI-powered deployment automation steps in and changes the game.
In this article, we'll explore how agencies are saving 30–50% of engineering hours and scaling client projects faster by using smart, automated cloud deployment tools.

What is a color-shifting hover card?
A color-shifting hover card is a type of hover effect that changes the background color of a card or element when the user hovers over it. It is a fun and interactive way to add some visual interest to your website or app. The effect is achieved by using CSS gradients and JavaScript to update the card's background color based on the user's cursor position. You can obviously use solid colors instead of gradients, but gradients are more versatile and can be used for more complex effects…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[💰 Cost Optimization with AWS Compute Optimizer.
“You can’t optimize what you don’t measure.” — This quote holds especially true in the cloud.
In this blog, I’ll walk you through what Compute Optimizer is, how it works, and how I used it in a real-world project to save money without compromising performance.
🔍 What is AWS Compute Optimizer?
EC2 instances
⚙️ How Compute Optimizer Works
Go to the AWS Console.
🧪 Real-World Use Case: Cost Cutting with EC2
We had 6 EC2 instances of type t3.large in a production environment. These handled various microservices with relatively low average usage but had burst workloads occasionally.
Compute Optimizer Analysis:
CPU utilization: <10% average
Switch to t3.medium
We used this migration strategy:
Create AMI backups
No increase in latency
🛑 Things to Keep in Mind
Is this instance intentionally over-provisioned? (e.g., for redundancy or DR)
📦 What About EBS and Lambda?
We had a general-purpose gp2 volume attached to our dev environment with almost no IO requirements.
Compute Optimizer suggested sc1 (cold HDD), and we tested it for archive-type workloads.
✅ Result: No functional issues, 60% storage cost saved.
Lambda
In a different project, our Lambda functions had 1024MB memory allocated by default. Compute Optimizer showed average usage around 200MB.
We lowered to 512MB, which also reduced the timeout rate and improved cold-start behavior.
📊 How to Track the Savings
Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor actual savings
AWS Trusted Advisor → checks for idle load balancers, unused IPs, etc.
🔚 Final Thoughts
🎯 It's free, data-backed, and supports multiple AWS services.
In my experience, implementing even 10–15% of the recommendations led to significant savings — without a single service interruption.]]></summary>

The concept began with Katacoding, a platform offering live, one-on-one online coding lessons via video calls. While the model had promise, it lacked scalability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made incredible strides in understanding and generating human language. From chatbots to virtual assistants, AI-powered tools can mimic human conversation, provide customer support, and even write articles. However, despite these advancements, AI will never fully capture human communication. Why? Because human language is deeply rooted in emotions, cultural contexts, creativity, and nuances that AI struggles to grasp.
This Blog explores the key differences between AI-generated language and human communication, highlighting why AI will always fall short of replicating human interaction entirely.
The Complexity of Human Language
Understand sarcasm and irony.
AI Lacks Emotional Intelligence:  AI vs. Human Emotions
Empathy in conversations.
Creativity and Storytelling: A Human-Only Domain
AI cannot create original ideas.
The Power of Personal Experiences Human Storytelling vs. AI
The Role of Cultural and Social Influences
Keep up with new trends in language.
The Importance of Human Connection AI vs. Human Communication
Body language and facial expressions.
Unintended discrimination in responses.
Lack of inclusivity in AI-generated content.
Conclusion:
AI has revolutionized language processing, but it cannot replace human communication. Our ability to connect emotionally, create original stories, and adapt language based on context makes human interaction irreplaceable. While AI can enhance communication, it will always need human guidance to ensure meaningful, ethical, and culturally aware interactions.]]></summary>

Here’s the thing Docker doesn’t stop you from doing dumb stuff. It happily lets you:
Run everything as root
Add shady scripts from the internet
Bake secrets into the image

Introduction: kubernetes’ package manager dilemma
If you’ve deployed anything non-trivial on Kubernetes, you’ve probably been blessed (read: cursed) by Helm. For years, Helm has been the default package manager for Kubernetes apps. Charts, releases, values.yaml, and enough curly braces to give you PTSD. It’s the duct tape that somehow holds your YAML together.
But like every DevOps tool we worship and then meme to death, Helm has started showing its age. What once felt like a brilliant abstraction now sometimes feels like writing YAML that generates YAML to apply more YAML. It’s powerful sure but can also feel like overengineering disguised as a templating solution.
And right when we thought we were stuck in helm upgrade …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How it all starts.


Back in August 2020, Epic Games added its own way to pay inside Fortnite, skipping Apple’s built-in payment system. This broke Apple’s App Store rules, so Apple removed Fortnite from the store. In response, Epic sued Apple, saying the company had too much monopoly and was stopping fair competition.
The courtroom drama went over several years:
September 2021: A judge ruled that Apple was mostly right, but one of its rules—stopping developers from telling users about other payment options—was unfair under California law. Apple had to let developers share links to other ways to pay.


April 2025: The court said Apple broke that rule again. Even after the 2021 order, Apple still charged a 27% fee on outside payments and made it hard for developers to show other payment opt…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today’s fast-moving digital landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are no longer just tools—they’re decision-makers, collaborators, and even strategists. But as these systems grow more autonomous and complex, a pressing question arises: Do we truly understand how AI thinks, learns, and evolves?
The evolving behavior of AI agents isn’t just a technical curiosity—it’s a critical business risk that leaders must monitor closely. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the inner workings of AI agents, explore how their behavior can shift over time, and what that means for businesses across industries.
What Are AI Agents, Really?
Unlike traditional software, AI agents learn and adapt. This ability, while powerful, can lead to unpredictable behaviors, especially as agents interact with new data or collaborate with other agents in a shared system.
The Evolution of AI Behavior: A Double-Edged Sword
Examples of Evolving AI Behavior:
Bias amplification: Over time, AI models may reinforce and amplify hidden biases in training data.
Unexpected strategy development: AI agents in competitive environments (e.g., simulations, financial markets) may develop unanticipated strategies that break norms or ethical boundaries.
These evolving behaviors can introduce operational, ethical, and reputational risks if not properly understood and controlled.
Why Business Leaders Should Care
Autonomy Can Create Blind Spots


Unpredictability Increases Risk Exposure


Regulations Are Coming



Strategies to Manage AI Behavioral Risk
✅ AI Explainability
✅ Continuous Monitoring
✅ Ethical AI Governance
✅ Simulation & Testing
The Future: Human-AI Collaboration with Guardrails
The question is no longer “What can AI do?” but “What is my AI actually doing—and why?”
Conclusion
🔍 Stay informed, stay prepared. The more we understand AI behavior, the safer—and smarter—our future becomes.]]></summary>

Here are some best practices - 
1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) with Least Privilege
Best Practice: Adopt a strict least privilege approach with our IAM policies. Assign users, roles, and services only the permissions they require, and enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
Examples:
Do not use root credentials for everyday tasks. Instead, create IAM roles for our services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) and assign specific policies.
Policy Example:

nil in the Go Language


In the practice of Go language programming, the use of nil is extremely common. For example, the default type is assigned as nil, the error return value often uses return nil, and multiple types use if != nil for judgment, etc. However, regarding the knowledge point of nil, developers need to have an in-depth understanding of its essence and related characteristics. This article will comprehensively analyze nil around the following core questions:
Is nil a keyword, a type, or a variable?
Which types can use the != nil syntax?
What are the similarities and differences in the interaction between different types and nil?
Why do some composite structures need make(Type) to be used after defining variables?
Why can a slice be…]]></summary>

You're not alone — but there's a smarter, cleaner, and way more scalable way to build UI components in Angular.
The secret? Mastering Angular Directives.
If you're aiming to build a high-performance, maintainable UI that can scale without becoming a nightmare, it's time to take Angular directives seriously. 
Let’s dive into how you can use them to supercharge your development process and create reusable UI elements like a pro.

Directives are Angular's secret sauce for extending HTML functionality. You can use them to:
Manipulate the DOM
Apply custom behavior to elements/components
Create shared functionality across the app

🔗 RestTemplate – classic and synchronous.
⚡ WebClient – reactive and non-blocking.
🤝 FeignClient – declarative and elegant.
We’ll build a common User model and implement full CRUD operations with all HTTP headers (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type, Accept).

Now we don't write verbose class-based components anymore. Over the years, the React team has introduced a ton of built-in hooks that solve specific problems.
But most of the people only stick with just useState() and useEffect(). But there are a lot of hooks that can improve your understanding and ability to write efficient code. As an experienced developer of React, I have tried to explain each of the advanced & newly introduced hooks with proper real-world code examples. Let's build the best app together.
Whenever you submit a form in React, you constantly juggle from to write the load of useStates and useEffects with fetch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The difference between @RestController and @Controller in Spring Framework lies mainly in how they handle HTTP responses.
@Controller




Used for: Traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) web applications.
Returns: Usually returns a View (like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
ResponseBody: If you want to return JSON/XML instead of a view, you must use @ResponseBody on the method.
Example:
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "hello";  // returns a view named "hello"
    }

    @GetMapping("/api")
    @ResponseBody
    public String api() {
        return "This is JSON or plain text";
    }
}

@RestController




Used for: RESTful web services (APIs).
Returns: Automatically returns JSON or XML responses.
Behavior: It is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody. So every method returns the body directly, not a view.
Example:
@RestController
public class MyRestController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, REST!";  // returns as JSON or plain text
    }
}




Feature
@Controller
@RestController




Returns View?
Yes (by default)
No


JSON/XML by default?
No (@ResponseBody needed)
Yes


Use case
Web UI applications
REST APIs


Combines with
@ResponseBody
Already includes @ResponseBody]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🛡️ Building Self-Healing SaaS Applications with Django & Frappe



What if your SaaS application could detect a cyberattack, recover from it, and keep running — without human help?
In this post, I’ll walk you through building a self-healing SaaS architecture using Django + Frappe, combining security automation, error detection, and real-time remediation — all in one stack.
Traditional SaaS platforms rely on:
Manual monitoring
Reactive fixes
Delayed recovery
In a world of zero-day threats and real-time exploits, this isn't enough.
A self-healing SaaS:

✅ Blocks malicious behavior

✅ Automatically restores services

✅ Notifies only when necessary  



Component
Purpose




Django
Core backend & API logic


Frappe
Metadata-based UI, DocTypes, and permissions


Celery + Redis
Background async healing tasks


Fail2Ban / UFW
Auto-blocking IP threats


Middleware
Attack detection & real-time interception


Audit Logs
Track incidents & healing cycles



Brute Force Login Attack



Middleware detects 5+ login failures from same IP

Stores event in logs

Triggers healing Celery task

Automatically:


Blocks IP via Fail2Ban/UFW

Restarts login module if crashed

Sends healing status alert
⏱️ Total recovery time: < 3 seconds

👤 Human involvement: 0
🔐 Auto-heal authentication abuse

🚫 IP blocking on attack detection

🧰 Restart crashed worker queues (Celery)

🔄 Fix broken DocType workflows

📈 Live dashboards for threat metrics







  
  
  💡 Key Takeaways



Self-healing is not just a trend, it's the future of cyber-resilient platforms.
Django + Frappe offer the perfect balance of flexibility, automation, and observability.
You’re not just building features—you’re building defense mechanisms into the fabric of your product.

A streaming platform wants to stream sport matches commented in English (of course completely legal) for Vietnamese viewers. They demand that the subtitle needed to be translated to Vietnamese with the lowest latency as possible. This blog is a PoC (Proof of Concept) for the translated streaming subtitle, using AWS Transcribe to transcribe the voice to text, Nova Micro to fix the text and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock to translate, with the support of serverless AWS ECS Fargate and Lambda.
Why not using Amazon Translate but use Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock? It is because the streaming videos are in special contexts, using sports vocabulary such as player names, item names which makes AWS Translate cannot identify and translate correctly.

Hayes doubts any government announcing print money plans for Bitcoin

Como fazer:
Use o método getConstructor(...) para obter o construtor desejado.
Em seguida, chame getParameters() para obter um array de Parameter.
Use getName() para acessar o nome de cada parâmetro.
Importante!
Por padrão, os nomes exibidos serão genéricos (arg0, arg1).
Para ver os nomes reais, é necessário compilar o código com a flag:




-parameters


Exemplo com flag:
javac -parameters Usuario.java


Sem essa flag:
Antes do Java 8:
Dependia de bibliotecas externas, como o Paranamer:
Paranamer paranamer = new CachingParanamer();
String[] parameterNames = paranamer.lookupParameterNames(constructor);


Vantagens da nova abordagem:
Evita dependências externas.
Facilita o uso de reflection de forma mais limpa e segura.
🛠️ Como compilar com a flag -parameters:
javac -parameters Usuario.java ReflectionTeste.java


E depois execute:
java ReflectionTeste


🧾 Saída esperada (com -parameters):
true: nome
true: pontos


🔁 Saída sem a flag -parameters:
false: arg0
false: arg1


💡 Importante: Para que os nomes reais dos parâmetros apareçam (nome, pontos), compile com a flag -parameters.

With Crew AI, teams are spinning up agents that:
Launch predictive marketing campaigns
Automate financial back-office ops
Optimize inventory and logistics
And tackle 100+ other enterprise use cases
But here’s the catch: agents are only as good as the data they can reach. That’s where SWIRL comes in.

By pairing Crew AI with SWIRL, you get more than just agents—you get enterprise-ready, data-rich workflows that scale. No custom plumbing. No brittle integrations.
With Crew AI + SWIRL, your agents can:
Connect to 100+ enterprise data sources out-of-the-box
Fetch the most relevant structured/unstructured data across silos
Respect row-level permissions with real enterprise auth
Summarize and answer with your LLM of choice
Plug in easily via zero-code connectors

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not every week is about shipping cool projects, sometimes it’s just about testing.
I spent the week running through various LocalStack Pro sample apps to make sure everything worked as expected. What I didn’t expect was to get hands-on with a whole bunch of AWS services I’ve barely touched before (and a few I had honestly never even heard of).
SageMaker → Machine learning workflows


RDS → Managed relational databases


Neptune → Graph databases


Step Functions → Orchestration workflows


Glue → Data catalog and ETL


MQ → Managed message brokers


Route 53 → DNS and traffic routing



...plus the usual mix of storage, compute, and API Gateway goodness.
What stood out this week was how much you can learn just by doing. I didn’t plan to dive into graph databases or message brokers, but while debugging and tinkering, I picked up quite a bit.
Having everything local with LocalStack definitely made that exploration easier and less intimidating.
First things first: I need to finish my Meme App (priorities are priorities).
Once that’s wrapped, I’d like to turn some of this accidental learning into small demos and share tips on how to explore unfamiliar AWS services without the usual stress.
If you’ve ever gone down the AWS rabbit hole and come out the other side with new scars and skills, I’d love to hear your story too. Just hit me up on Twitter or LinkedIn. Catch y'all next week!]]></summary>

Without a clear way to authenticate dynamically, AI agents either hit brittle, hardcoded APIs or introduce serious security gaps. That’s why authorization has been one of the biggest missing pieces in the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
When MCP was first introduced, it focused on helping AI agents interact with APIs. But it left out that one critical capability: authorization. For the past six months, the MCP team has been working to change that, building a secure, dynamic authorization layer that can keep up with the unpredictable nature of agentic systems.

Often, when I'm on discovery calls with potential clients, a common question arises: "Do you think building an app for my business is a good idea?" My response can sometimes be neutral—or even disappointing—but there's an essential reason for that honesty.
Statistically speaking, about 90% of SaaS (Software as a Service) startups fail. This fact isn't meant to discourage entrepreneurs but to inject a necessary dose of realism. As a software developer, I notice that of all the apps installed on my phone or computer, roughly 90% rarely get opened after the initial installation. Sure, some might be used weekly, like social media apps or games, but only a few become daily essentials. Think about your usage: development tools (Xcode, VS Code), browsers (…]]></summary>

Outsourced is an ISO-certified offshore staffing company based in the Philippines that specializes in building full-time teams for its clients. Through offshore outsourcing with Outsourced, businesses can potentially save up to 75% on salaries compared to local hiring.
Outsourced was founded in 2012 by CEO Mike Larcher, who became frustrated with local hiring challenges in Australia. He found it difficult to find and retain skilled talent locally, which prompted him to look abroad.

BTC hit $97,900 due to soaring institutional investor demand, but futures pricing shows traders aren't confident in a sustained rally.

Macroeconomic risks and global trade tensions cap bullish sentiment despite $3.6 billion in spot BTC ETF inflows.

BTC options lean bullish, suggesting big players expect upside, but their caution keeps leverage use low.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke out of a tight trading range between $93,000 and $95,600 on May 1, following six days of limited movement. Despite reaching its highest price in ten weeks at $97,930, sentiment remains neutral according to BTC derivatives indicators. This price action has occurred alongside significant net inflows into US spot exchange-traded Bitcoin funds (ETFs).

That was the PDP-10—still running when C was dominant, C++ was just emerging (but not yet standardized), Java hadn’t launched (just one year before its release), and Python was still in development (two years before version 1.0).
That kind of diversity hasn’t gone away—it’s just shifted. Today:
There are 35+ active CPU architecture families: x86/64, Arm, MIPS, RISC-V, Xtensa, TriCore, SPARC, PIC, AVR, and many more

Some use unusual instruction widths (e.g., 13-bit for Padauk’s $0.03 MCU)

In this article, I’ll walk you through how to do just that—without sacrificing quality, security, or credibility.
If you're building a cryptocurrency on a budget, the Ethereum blockchain is a great starting point. More specifically, the ERC-20 token standard lets you launch a new token by simply writing and deploying a smart contract.
You don’t need to build your own blockchain, manage nodes, or run any servers. Instead, you leverage the security and reliability of Ethereum’s existing infrastructure.

LinkedIn 
This article will only cover VS code extensions that helped me during development. Some of these tools were introduced to me by a friend of mine. You can search for them in the VS extension marketplace 👍
It integrates Draw.io into your VScode. Making creating diagrams a lot easier. This tool is useful for creating a mockup design for the frontend of the web application. 
This is probably one of my favorite Git VScode extensions. A really great tool for visualizing your Git repository commits. I use it to track the commits I made. If you are working with another developer, you can see the commits made by each other in different color trees.
This is a tool that has helped me categorise my projects. I have made a lot of projects and they tend to be scattered. This tool helped me organise them into blocks. Clicking on them takes me to the project workspace immediately.
One of my favorite tools in my VScode workspace. This extension allows you to store you previous terminal session. You can create a configuration, these configuration can store a set of terminal commands. This is great for variety of functions, like Dockerization, Database migration, and API testings.
This is probably my favorite tool out of all the extensions. It prevents the need to add a console.log in my JS files. I can see the output clearly in the console. It boosts my productivity a lot , and I recommend it the most.
I hope this article helped with your workspace productivity. 
Happy coding ! 😄]]></summary>

Ethereum is still the most popular L1 network. According to data from DefiLlama, its roughly $52 billion in total value locked (TVL) represents 51% of cryptocurrency residing on blockchain networks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Na parte 1 desta série, vimos como o Module Federation permite compartilhar componentes entre diferentes aplicações sem precisar instalar pacotes ou duplicar código. Agora, vamos dar um passo além: como enviar dados de uma aplicação para outra.
Imagine que você tem dois apps:
🔵 MF Consumer  — quem consome um componente remoto
🟢 MF Provider  — quem disponibiliza esse componente
conforme a imagem abaixo:

Vamos supor que o MF Provider tenha um componente chamado App que precisa exibir os dados de um usuário ( nome e email ). Esses dados vêm diretamente do MF Consumer.
No MF Consumer, tem o seguinte:

MF Consumer
Aqui, criei um objeto user e passei como props para o componente Provider , que está vindo do MF Provider.
No lado do MF Provider , defini o tipo das props ( ProviderProps ) e usei os dados recebidos normalmente, como faríamos em qualquer componente React, como segue:

MF Provider
Não é magia. É só React com Module Federation! Ao consumir um componente remoto, você ainda pode passar props normalmente, como se ele fosse local. Isso funciona porque, por baixo dos panos, o Webpack cuida de toda a importação remota — mas o React continua funcionando do jeito que a gente conhece.
Com isso, conseguimos:
Importar um componente remoto com Module Federation
Passar dados para esse componente via props
Exibir esses dados no MF Provider como se tudo estivesse rodando no mesmo app
Acompanhe AQUI como ficou o resultado final.
No próximo artigo, vou mostrar como esse padrão pode ser estendido para eventos e callbacks entre MF Consumer e MF Provider (ex: o usuário clica em algo no Provider e o Consumer reage).
💬 Curtiu? Me conta nos comentários como você está usando MF ou se está considerando aplicar na sua stack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No meu artigo anterior, mostrei como montei um projeto com Micro Frontends usando Rsbuild, Module Federation, pnpm e Lerna , tudo rodando num monorepo. Agora, quero dar um passo além e explicar o “porquê” dessa escolha.
É uma forma de compartilhar código entre diferentes aplicações em tempo de execução. Funciona como se um app pudesse importar um componente diretamente do outro — sem instalar, copiar ou duplicar código.
Exemplo real no meu repositório:
📦 mf_provider(chamo de componente filho): expõe um componente Button
📦 mf_consumer_(_chamo de componente pai): consome esse mesmo Header, remotamente, sem precisar tê-lo no código local
✅ Evita reescrever os mesmos componentes em diferentes apps (pelo menos tenta)
✅ Permite deploys independentes (independência de times)
✅ Melhora a escalabilidade de grandes projetos
✅ Facilita refatorações e testes A/B isolados
✅ Acelera o desenvolvimento com reuso real de UI e lógica
“Você não precisa de Micro Frontends… até precisar.”
Nem todo projeto precisa disso.
🔸 Se o projeto é pequeno e centralizado, pode ser complexidade desnecessária
🔸 Se as equipes compartilham tudo e fazem deploy juntos, MF talvez seja overkill
🔸 Se o bundle não é um problema, pode usar libs compartilhadas internas

Here's a deep dive into what it is, why you'd use it, and a step-by-step guide to implementing it in Express.
1.Separation of Concerns
Versioning in headers keeps your URL space clean - clients still call /users instead of /v1/users or /v2/users.
2.Content Negotiation
HTTP was designed around content negotiation. You can leverage the Accept header or a custom header (e.g. X-API-Version) to tell your server which variant of the response to emit.
3.Granular Control
You can version on a per-resource or even per-field basis depending on header values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[💡 Quer estudar, prototipar ou estruturar um projeto com MF (Microfrontend) de forma modular e performática?
Nos últimos dias, mergulhei em um experimento que pode facilitar (e muito!) a vida de quem trabalha com micro frontends no dia a dia.
🎯 Criei um repositório open source usando:
Rsbuild (alternativa moderna e rápida ao Webpack)
Module Federation para isolar e compartilhar componentes entre apps
pnpm + Lerna pra orquestrar tudo de forma leve e organizada
📂 Estrutura simples, mas poderosa:
apps/mf_provider: expõe componentes
apps/mf_consumer: consome via Module Federation
Tudo rodando em paralelo com pnpm dev
🔗 Confere lá e, se curtir, arrocha um like ou manda feedback!
Repositório no Github
O pnpm tem um recurso bem legal chamado Catalogs. Ele serve para definir versões de dependências como constantes, que podem ser reutilizadas nos módulos internos dentro do package.json de cada projeto.
Exemplo:
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
# Define a catalog of version ranges.
catalog:
  react: "^18.3.1"
  react-dom: "^18.3.1"

# Nos módulos internos, consigo reutilizar a versão definida no pnpm-workspace.yaml
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "catalog",
    "react-dom": "catalog"
  }

Outra curiosidade bem legal é a praticidade que o Lerna oferece na criação de um monorepo, permitindo executar vários apps juntos de forma paralela com um único comando, como no exemplo abaixo:
"dev": "lerna run --parallel dev",

Rsbuild + Module Federation se mostrou extremamente simples de estruturar e entender, especialmente se comparado ao uso do plugin com Webpack. No próximo artigo, trarei um exemplo utilizando Vite para termos uma ideia prática.
Até mais.
Curtiu a ideia ou tá explorando algo parecido? Bora trocar ideia.

  Historical Context


The Gamepad API represents a significant leap in web technology, providing developers with the ability to access gamepad inputs natively within a web browser. Before this API, developers often relied on browser support for other technologies, such as Flash or native applications, to create engaging gaming experiences on the web. The introduction of the Gamepad API in the late 2010s marked a paradigm shift; it allowed developers to create immersive gaming experiences that can fully leverage console-style gamepad controls within HTML5 applications.
The specification for the Gamepad API was drafted in the W3C Gamepad Community Group and has seen constant evolution since its inception. As of late…]]></summary>

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score below 18 implied a “risk-on” environment, favoring assets like Bitcoin. 
Peterson’s model, which had a 95% tracking accuracy, predicted a $135,000 target within the next 100 days if the VIX remains low. This aligns with Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, as a low VIX reduces uncertainty, encouraging investment in ri…]]></summary>

The fintech revolution is coming, and at its core lies one of the most underrated innovations of our time — the blockchain ledger. This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies or buzzwords. It’s about the raw cryptographic power that makes trustless, decentralized finance possible.
Welcome to Episode 1 of our new video series breaking down the XRP Ledger (XRPL) — one concept at a time.
🎥 Watch on YouTube
In this episode, we dive into the two cryptographic pillars behind the XRPL and modern blockchain systems:
Hashing: Immutable fingerprints for any data
Encryption: Protecting the integrity and privacy of transactions
Why Hashing ≠ Encryption (and why that matters)
How the XRPL uses these concepts under the hood
Whether you're new to Web3 or building on XRPL, these are tools you must understand.
Most developers know what a hash function is. Fewer understand why it's critical in blockchain consensus, how it supports immutability, or how encryption standards impact financial systems at scale.
This series will bridge that gap — starting here.
SHA-256
Public/Private Key Encryption
XRP Ledger’s core protocol
Blockchain developers
Fintech engineers
XRPL builders
Anyone curious about real-world cryptography in action






📢 Follow the series — we’ll be breaking down the XRPL layer by layer, from consensus algorithms to smart contract integration (Hooks), and more.
➡️ Drop your thoughts or questions below — and let’s build the future of finance, together.

The nodes mostly comprise human users who provide data in exchange for rewards via the network’s mobile application, COIN. “The vast majority of our 10 million nodes are mobile users, but some are IoT devices like smart speakers,” Levin told Cointelegraph. 
Approximately 80% of XYO’s users are non-crypto natives who are participating in Web3 for the first time, he added.

Bitcoin (BTC) rose to an over two-month high of $97,300 last seen at the end of February, before the “Liberation Day” tariffs announcement in the US, bolstering analyst predictions for a rally driven by “structural” institutional and exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows into the world’s first cryptocurrency.
Risk appetite continued rising among crypto investors, as Chinese state-linked news outlets indicated that the Trump administration has quietly contacted Beijing to discuss tariff reductions.

We wrote docs assuming someone would read them. We wrapped our endpoints in auth flows and user interfaces. We expected a person, or maybe a service, on the other side.
But that’s already changing.
AI models are now consuming APIs directly. Not as passive data readers, but as active participants. They parse user intent, synthesize context, and trigger backend actions. They're not just clients. They're intermediaries.
And that changes everything.
When models call APIs, natural language stops being enough.
We like to imagine that models “understand” prompts, but in practice, they just compute probabilities over sequences of text. They don’t grasp nuance the way humans do. A tiny shift in phrasing can derail the whole interaction.

According to the report, 94% of employees have some familiarity with generative AI tools. Most execs estimated 4% of their teams already use AI heavily at work. However, the real figure is 12%, three times higher.

Even skeptics are on board. The report labels cautious employees as "Gloomers" (37% of the workforce), who want tight AI oversight, and "Doomers" (4%), who distrust AI outright. Yet 80% of Gloomers and 50% of Doomers say they’re comfortable using AI at work. That shows widespread readiness, not just enthusiasm from the usual suspects.

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Mongoose and TypeScript, two helper types make your life much easier:
/**
 * Extracts the “plain” shape of your schema—
 * just the fields you defined, without Mongoose’s built-in methods or `_id`.
 */
export type User = InferSchemaType<typeof userSchema>;

/**
 * Represents a fully “hydrated” Mongoose document:
 * your fields plus all of Mongoose’s methods and metadata
 * (e.g. `_id`, `save()`, `populate()`, etc.).
 */
export type UserDocument = HydratedDocument<User>;

export const userModel = model<UserDocument>("user", userSchema);

InferSchemaType


• Produces a pure TypeScript type from your schema definition.
• Use it whenever you need just the data shape (e.g. DTOs, service inputs/outputs).
HydratedDocument


• Wraps your base type T with Mongoose’s document helpers.
• Use it for any function that deals with real, database-backed 
For example, in a repository interface you might write:
export interface IUserRepository {
  findOneByEmail(email: string): Promise<UserDocument>;
  findById(id: Types.ObjectId): Promise<UserDocument>;
  create(
    createUserDto: Pick<CreateUserDto, 'email' | 'password'>,
  ): Promise<UserDocument>;
}

Here, each method clearly promises a “live” Mongoose document (with built-in methods) while elsewhere you can rely on User for pure data shapes—keeping your boundaries and types crystal clear.

In contrast to batch processing, where data is collected and processed in chunks, streaming data processing deals with data in motion. Instead of waiting for data to accumulate before running transformations, streaming pipelines ingest and process each piece of data as it arrives.

Hybrid architectures combine elements of client-server and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems.

Goal:  
Take advantage of both models (client-server manageability + P2P scalability).

Solve the problems of purely decentralized systems (for example, low reliability or "freeloaders" in P2P).







  
  
  2. Edge-Server Systems (Systems with edge servers)



  
  
  2.1. Definition and location in the network




Edge servers are located at the junction of networks:


Between the corporate network and the Internet (for example, for Internet service providers — ISPs).

Between users and the core of the Internet (for example, CDN servers).






Examples:
Cloudflare and Akamai servers.


Local caching proxies at the ISP.

Born in 2013 as a private placement, GBTC pioneered regulated Bitcoin investment, granting investors access to Bitcoin’s (BTC) meteoric rise without the perils of digital wallets or unregulated exchanges.
On Jan. 11, 2024, it transitioned into a spot Bitcoin ETF following a landmark victory against the SEC. This marked a pivotal moment with the SEC’s view that ETFs can offer lower expense ratios and enhanced tax efficiency compared to traditional funds. 
Even still, GBTC’s financial resilience shines, generating $268.5 million in annual revenue, surpassing the $211.8 million of all other US spot Bitcoin ETFs combined, despite losing over …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sure! Here's a DEV.to style blog post for your project Crop Yield Prediction:
An ML project to empower smarter agriculture decisions
GitHub Repo →
Agriculture remains the backbone of the Indian economy, yet farmers still face unpredictable yields due to varying environmental and input conditions. To tackle this issue, I built a machine learning model that predicts crop yield based on historical and input-based features.
This project is simple, beginner-friendly, and practical.
"How can we accurately predict crop yield based on inputs like rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide use?"
Farmers often rely on experience or guesswork. This model helps bring data-driven decision-making to the field.
The dataset includes:
Area
Production
Crop Year
Rainfall
Fertilizer
Pesticide
📌 Categorical features are label-encoded for model compatibility.
Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (optional for plots)
I trained and evaluated three regression models:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor ✅ Best performer



  
  
  Evaluation Metrics:



R² Score
Adjusted R²
RMSE
Gradient Boosting gave the highest R² score on the test set and was chosen as the final model.
The script allows users to input values for the features and get instant yield predictions.
Clone the repo and run the script locally:
git clone https://github.com/h4ck3r0/crop-yielding-prediction
cd crop-yielding-prediction
python main.py

Add UI with Streamlit or Flask
Integrate with real-time weather APIs
Visual analytics for predictions
This is a practical application of ML in solving a real-world agricultural problem.
🔗 GitHub: h4ck3r0/crop-yielding-prediction

This experiment shows that, ideally, a secure encryption scheme should give an attacker a probability of guessing bit b, tending to 1/2 (or 50%).

Definition 3.18 says that a private key encryption scheme is secure when used repeatedly if an adversary (e.g. hacker) cannot distinguish the encryption of two different sets of messages.

The enemy selects two sets of messages (for example, two lists).


One of them is encrypted, and the enemy is trying to guess which one it is.

Once data has been ingested into your system, the next step is to prepare it for actual use. This typically involves cleaning, transforming, and storing the data in a way that supports analysis, reporting, or further processing. This is where data pipelines come in, and at the center of pipeline design are two common strategies: ETL and ELT.
Although they may look similar at first glance, ETL and ELT represent fundamentally different approaches to handling data transformation…]]></summary>

Using AI to Generate Seed Data for Supabase
Every developer knows the importance of having good seed data for fast testing and development. Manually crafting SQL queries to populate your database with realistic data can be tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex relationships between tables.
SupaSeeder connects to your Supabase instance, extracts the database schema, then you can either generate SQL insert statements or optimized prompts to use with any AI model to generate the seed data you need.
supaseeder.vercel.app 🔥



  
  
  ⚙️ How It Works




Provide Supabase URL & Anon Key

Connects to your database and reads the schema.


Write a prompt

Describe the data you want (e.g. "10 users with 5 posts each").


Pick mode





Prompt Mode: Get optimized prompts to use with any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
Direct Mode: Get complete SQL queries generated using OpenAI
Get SQL output
Copy & paste to your SQL editor or Supabase SQL Runner.
Clone the repository:




   git clone https://github.com/mmvergara/supaseeder.git
   cd supaseeder

Install dependencies:




   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install

Start the development server:




   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev]]></summary>

Two of the most common messaging patterns are queues and topics. While they might sound similar, their behavior and use cases are quite different.
In this post, I’ll explain what they are, how they differ, and when to use each one.
A queue follows a point-to-point communication model: messages are sent by a producer and consumed by only one consumer. Once a message is processed, it is removed from the queue.
Key characteristics:
Each message is processed by one and only one consumer.
Guarantees single delivery of each message.

Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.
Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure. 
It enables developers and engineers to build a censorship-resistant and accessible open-data web to champion the cause of free speech. Open-source technology creates a paradigmatic shift in a fair and inclusive internet where centralized web companie…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Spring Boot and JPA, understanding how transactions and the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() operation interact can make or break your application's data consistency and performance. Yet, I often see even experienced developers overlook the nuances!
Many believe that committing a transaction is the only way to persist changes to the database. However, the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() method forces the persistence context to synchronize with the underlying database immediately-without ending the transaction. This can be a game-changer for scenarios where you need to validate constraints or trigger database actions before the transaction completes.
But here’s the catch: improper use of 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() can lead to unexpected behaviors, performance overhead, or even data inconsistencies if not handled carefully. It's crucial to know when and why to use it, especially in complex microservices or batch processing environments.
How do you approach transaction management and flushing in your Spring Boot projects? Have you ever faced a tricky bug or performance issue related to this? Share your experience or tips in the comments-let’s learn from each other!

Dependency Injection (DI) is one of the most debated design patterns in software development. While opinions vary on whether it’s universally beneficial, one thing is certain: DI can be extremely useful if not treated as a "golden hammer." Overusing it, such as blindly injecting every dependency, can lead to unnecessary complexity rather than cleaner code.
In this article, we’ll explore how DI can be effectively applied in Next.js, striking the right balance between maintainability and simplicity.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vector search is becoming a core workload for AI-driven applications. But do you really need to introduce a new system just to handle it?
We ran a performancebenchmark to find out: comparing PostgreSQL (using pgvector + pgvectorscale) with Qdrant on 50 million embeddings.
Sub-100ms query latencies
471 queries per second (QPS) on Postgres—11x higher throughput than Qdrant (41 QPS)
Head to the full write-up for a deep dive into our vector database comparison.

At 99% recall, Postgres delivers sub-100ms query latencies and handles 11x more query throughput than Qdrant (471 QPS vs. Qdrant’s 41 QPS).
The results show that thanks to pgvectorscale, Postgres can keep up with specialized vector databases and deliver as good, if not better performance at scale. Learn more about why Postgres wins for AI and vector workloads.
How? We built pgvectorscale to push Postgres to its limits for vector workloads—without compromising recall, latency, or cost-efficiency. It turns your favorite relational database into a high-performance vector search engine.
✅ No extra systems.
✅ No new query languages.
✅ Just Postgres.
We used RTABench to run a transparent, reproducible evaluation—designed for real-world, high-scale workloads.
Curious about the architecture behind it all?
👉 Read our whitepaper on building Timescale for real-time and AI workloads
It dives into how we engineered Timescale to handle time-series, vector, and relational data—all in one Postgres-native platform.

After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.

HTTP is the foundation of everything we build and interact with on the web — whether it’s a static website, a complex Single Page Application (SPA), a RESTful API, or a modern mobile app.
Every user action that triggers data exchange — from submitting a login form to loading an image — ultimately depends on HTTP.
Despite this, many developers treat HTTP as a black box: something that “just works” behind the scenes. While abstraction is useful, serious web developers must move beyond it.
Understanding how HTTP actually operates — from how requests are structured, to how connections are established, to how responses are transmitted — is essential for building high-quality, secure, and performant applications.

In this post, I’ll be dissecting a real-world data engineering project that analyzes the French Data Engineering job market. The goal? To break down the project’s infrastructure, orchestration, and cloud design—spotlighting what works well, what could be improved, and, most importantly, what we can all learn as practicing data engineers.
Why do this? Because reviewing and sharing feedback on real-world projects sharpens our own skills, encourages open knowledge sharing, and helps us all grow together. Let’s dig in.

One emerging trend is AI dating pictures: profile photos generated or enhanced by AI to help users present their “best selves” on dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, or even social media platforms.
But what exactly are AI dating pictures, and are they a good idea? Let’s break it down.
AI dating pictures refer to profile photos that are either:
✅ Generated entirely by AI — using tools like AI portrait generators or avatars based on your real face.
✅** Enhanced or edited by AI** — improving lighting, removing blemishes, sharpening features, or even subtly reshaping facial features.

Multi currency, aka exchange rate management
Time-zone management
Ages have passed, but those topics keep staying in the top 5 chart of my headaches-giver topics.
Just today, scrolling in my LinkedIn wall, I've found an interesting article from Nick Doelman that pointed to another article from 2021 where he solved the long-standing issue of updating exchange rates in the platform in an way that is
straightforward
elegant
deterministic
fast to set-up
and, above all, free!
It's just a matter of leveraging the right tools, that in this case are:
https://exchangeratesapi.io/: a website that provides daily updated exchange rates with a compelling licensing model that allows up to 100 api calls per month for free!
a simple Power Automate flow.
Take a look at his article for details!

You might be laughing a bit here. Of course .json and js goes hand in hand. Since the beginning of time we have used .json files to throw in config, mock data or see how many levels of data-indentation we can reach before we go crazy.
Well, what I want to do is have a data.json file where I "mock" all the data I want/need for a page so:
In practise this means I can simply import my file, and since I am not crazy and love using TypeScript, I can also type my data:

You start with enthusiasm, binge a few lessons, and then… confusion. What’s the difference between Flexbox and Grid? Why does your CSS break on mobile? How do you even land a job after this?
You’re not alone. The tech industry is flooded with resources claiming to teach you web design in weeks, but most leave you stuck in tutorial hell — overwhelmed, under-skilled, and unsure how to turn coding into a career.

For developers working in blockchain and fintech infrastructure, this is more than a market headline—it’s a potential stress point for applications reliant on real-time price data, order execution, and network performance.
Understanding these macroeconomic triggers is critical for building resilient crypto-native systems.
Bitcoin is currently trading near the $59,000–$60,000 support zone after facing rejection from resistance at approximately $63,000 earlier this week. Despite brief recoveries, sentiment remains cautious ahead of economic data releases.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, allows systems to analyze patterns, make predictions, and improve over time without being explicitly programmed. This is particularly useful in fields like healthcare, where AI is used to detect diseases from scans, and in finance, where algorithms assess risk and detect fraud in real time.

Asked about his tariff program, the president remarked, “Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open. Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.’”
But the toy stores where those dolls are sold might have something to say about it. 
Earlier in the week, Mischief Toy Store in St. Paul, Minnesota joined a growing number of American small businesses suing the president over his emergency tariff plan.
Throughout April, a groundswell of lawsuits led by 13 states further challenged Trump’s ambitious tariff program. Their success or failure rests on hundreds of years of judicial policy an…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🧵 Interfaces in Java, explained like you're 5!



  
  
  1️⃣ Imagine a Pizza Menu 🍕


You walk into a pizza place and see a menu. The menu promises what pizzas they offer—but doesn’t make them yet.

An interface in Java is like that menu: it defines what a class should do, but not how!  
The menu says:  
"All pizzas must have cheese 🧀"

"All pizzas must be bakeable 🔥"
Any chef (class) who follows this menu must fulfill these rules! In Java, we call this "implementing an interface."







  
  
  3️⃣ Multiple Menus, One Chef!


A chef can follow multiple menus (interfaces):  
Italian food menu 🍝

Fast food menu 🍔
Similarly, a Java class can implement many interfaces at once! (Unlike inheritance, where you only get one parent.)







  
  
  4️⃣ But… What If the Chef Cheats? 😱


If a chef says, "I’ll follow the pizza menu!" but doesn’t add cheese… BIG PROBLEM!

Java won’t allow this—it forces the class to implement every method in the interface, or the code won’t compile!  
What if some pizzas usually have tomato sauce, but not always?

Interfaces can now provide default methods—like a "standard recipe" that chefs can override if they want!  

java
interface Pizza {  
    default void addSauce() { System.out.println("Adding tomato sauce!"); }  
}]]></summary>

You might have heard of Schrödinger’s Cat — the thought experiment where a cat in a box is both alive and dead until you check. That's basically an Optional, right? A value that might exist... or not.
So, let's turn this idea into code:
enum 📦<Value> {
    case 😺(Value)
    case 😵

    init(_ from: Value) {
        self = .😺(from)
    }
}

Now we can do:
let x: 📦 = .😺(123)
let y: 📦 = .😵

But that's not quite as convenient as Swift's native syntax: let x: Int? = 123.
Can we make ours feel just as nice?
Swift lets types conform to ExpressibleByNilLiteral. Let’s do that:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The success of a mobile app heavily depends on its user interface (UI) and user experience (UX). A well-designed app is intuitive, engaging, and keeps users coming back. On the other hand, a poorly designed app frustrates users, leading to uninstalls and negative reviews. With millions of apps competing for attention, a flawless UI/UX design can be the game-changer that sets your app apart.
Users appreciate an app that is easy to navigate. A cluttered and confusing interface overwhelms users, leading to higher bounce rates. Simplicity doesn’t mean your app should be bare-bones, but rather that it should be free from unnecessary elements that distract from the core functionality.
Minimize distractions by using a clean and structured layout. Every element should have a clear purpose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We need ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to enable communication between devices on a local network. Specifically, ARP is used to map an IP address (logical address) to a MAC address (physical address), which is necessary for data transmission at the data link layer.
ARP is a Layer 2 protocol used in IPv4 networks to map a known IP address to its corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) address. While IP addresses help devices find each other logically, MAC addresses are what Ethernet networks use to actually deliver packets. ARP acts as the translator between these two.
IP works at Layer 3 (Network Layer) but to actually send data over Ethernet (Layer 2), the system needs the MAC address of the destination device.

O Facade é um padrão de projeto do tipo estrutural. Ele consiste na criação de uma classe intermediária (ou fachada) que expõe uma interface simplificada para um conjunto de classes ou processos mais complexos.
Seu principal objetivo é desacoplar a lógica de negócios da complexidade de múltiplas instâncias e chamadas internas, permitindo que outras partes do sistema interajam com uma interface unificada e mais limpa. Isso melhora a organização do código, facilita a manutenção e reduz a dependência direta de implementações internas.

Why do we need a typography component?
Consistent typography is key to keeping your website looking clean and organized. Without it, things can start to look messy fast. A typography component helps keep text styling uniform across your whole site. The idea here is to make it both flexible and well-defined, so you get a good balance between structure and creativity, since not everything is just black and white. ‘]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to part 4 in the series of shell scripting. Today we will look at a script that goes through an array with complex values. Complex values such as spaces, apostrophes, and quotes.
Scripting is the process of writing a set of instructions in a programming or scripting language to automate tasks that would otherwise be done manually. In the context of shell scripting, these instructions are written for the command-line shell, allowing users to perform complex operations - like file management, backups, or software installations - with just a single script execution. It's a powerful tool for saving time and ensuring consistency in system administration and development workflows


Create the script in VIM, complex_list.sh



Write and save the script in VIM.



We can check whether it has been created  by doing ls -ltrh.



Give the permission so the script can be executed.



If we then do a ls –ltrh we can see the script has gained a green colour, meaning that it is now executable.



Output after executing the script by using the command ./




  
  
  Stay tuned, part 5 in the series coming tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excelorithm, we build custom software solutions for startups, SMEs, and enterprise clients alike. And as the technical head here, I’ve seen a recurring pain point — many teams, including our own, spend way too much time setting up the basics of a SaaS product: authentication, subscriptions, dashboards, role management, notifications...
Sure, there are tons of SaaS starter kits out there, both free and premium. They promise speed — and often deliver — but usually at a hidden cost: vendor lock-in.
Many popular boilerplates rely on proprietary services, paid APIs, or tightly coupled ecosystems. That might be fine early on, but over time it limits your freedom, raises your costs, and ties you to someone else’s roadmap.
That’s why we built SaaSLaunchpad — a free, open-source Next.js SaaS starter kit with zero paid tool dependencies and no vendor lock-in.

Anyone who has used traditional payment systems will likely be familiar with refunds and chargebacks. If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.
However, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.

Bitcoin long-term holders are about to hit a level of unrealized profit, which has traditionally caused them to sell.

That level coincides with the return to a six-figure BTC price.

Order book data suggests that bulls may not succeed in keeping the upside going.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “notable increase” in selling from its older investors if price rises further, warns onchain analytics firm Glassnode.
In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” researchers calculated that long-term holders (LTHs) are sitting on almost 350% unrealized profits.

Fair source software is a licensing model designed to balance the freedom of open source with the revenue potential of proprietary software. This blog post explores the history, core concepts, practical applications, challenges, and future innovations of fair source software. By blending aspects of open access with commercial monetization, fair source software offers an alternative ecosystem where developers can engage communities while earning sustainable revenue. We also compare fair source with traditional licensing models using tables and bullet lists for clarity. Furthermore, we discuss additional facets such as funding strategies and legal complexities that shape this emerging model in the digital landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[INTRODUCTION:
But exactly is the purpose of the Node Operators in the Catalysis Ecosystem? well let's get into that now.
They power the services (AVSs) by doing important technical tasks.
They also help protect the network by locking up funds (called 
staking)—this keeps them honest.
If they do something wrong, they can lose money so they have a 
strong reason to act fairly.
I'm pretty sure at this point you can fairly understand why they are called the backbone of the network. Basically without them nothing would work.
HOW DOES CATALYSIS WORK IN RELATION TO THE NODE OPERATORS?
Normally, running these services on many platforms is complicated and 
expensive.
Catalysis simplifies this by giving them one tool (Catalyst-CLI) 
to manage everything in one place.

Any service that's meant to live more than couple of weeks eventually reaches the stage where you feel the need to properly monitor it. You usually start with simple console.log logging, but soon realize it's not readable enough, it's not searchable enough and it's only available on your server. Probably inside Docker container.

The suspension came after a recently announced third-party review requested by the Movement Network Foundation into an agreement orchestrated by Manche with Rentech — the latter helped broker an agreement with market maker Web3Port.

Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition.
AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality.

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin (BTC) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs. However, that’s since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post.
“Online discussions about these high-risk tokens have proliferated as traders embrace a gamble mindset, rather than a calculated investment approach,” he said.
“This is a telltale sign that traders are increasingly investing based solely on speculation and short-term gains,” Quinlivan added.

“We achieved a new record for quarterly revenue this quarter, at $161.4 million,” Riot CEO Jason Les said in a May 1 report for its first quarter 2025 earnings. The company just surpassed Wall Street estimates of $159.79 million by 1%.
Riot’s Q1 revenue was a 50% jump compared to the same quarter a year ago.

The SEC said in a May 1 joint stipulation with Balina to an Austin federal court that it “believes the dismissal of this case is appropriate,” citing the work of the agency’s Crypto Task Force.
The agency didn’t give a reason for wanting to dismiss its case, but said its decision “does not necessarily reflect the Commission’s position on any other case.”
Balina told Cointelegraph in March that the SEC had informed him it would recommend the court dismiss the case and claimed the agency’s actions were based on a shift in the agency’s priorities.

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token.
If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled.
Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.”

“What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role quickly turned into an intelligence-gathering operation,” the company wrote in a May 1 blog post.
Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview.
Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used.

Kraken said in a May 1 report that its NinjaTrader acquisition would give its US customers access to the traditional derivatives market, aligning with its plans to expand its offerings and be the go-to platform for all types of trading.
NinjaTrader is a registered Futures Commission Merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Last month, it rolled out trading for over 11,000 stocks and exchange-traded funds to certain US clients.
The deal, which Kraken dubbed the largest ever between a crypto and traditional finance firm, allows NinjaTrader to expand to the UK, continental Europe and Australian market…]]></summary>

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Two Pointers, String, Dynamic Programming
There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.
After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.
You are given a string dominoes representing the initial state where:

        <updated>2025-05-02T00:43:51.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By default, Spring Data JPA loads related data lazily, which can cause the N+1 problem — one query for the main data and more for each related item. @EntityGraph annotation fixes this by letting you load related data in a single query, without changing your entity mapping. It’s simple, improves performance, and avoids writing custom JOIN FETCH queries.
Let’s say you have a Post entity that references an Author.
Entities
@Entity
public class Post {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String title;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Author author;
}

@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}

Repository
public interface PostRepository extends JpaRepository<Post, Long> {

    // attributePaths specifies related entities to eagerly load
    @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"author"})
    List<Post> findAll();
}

Now, if you create a simple controller to return all posts and have SQL logging enabled, you'll see the queries printed in the console.
With @EntityGraph, only one query runs to fetch both the post and its author. Without it, multiple queries are executed — one for the posts and one for each author — which is the N+1 problem.
✅ Using @EntityGraph
Only one query — fast and efficient.
select p.id, p.title, a.id, a.name
from post p
left join author a on p.author_id = a.id

🚨 Not Using @EntityGraph
N+1 queries — slow and wasteful.
select * from post;
select * from author where id = ?;
select * from author where id = ?;]]></summary>

O que é o LangGraph?


O LangGraph é uma extensão do LangChain que permite construir fluxos de execução orientados a grafos para LLMs e agentes. Em vez de seguir uma sequência fixa de passos (como num pipeline tradicional), você define nós (nodes) e arestas (edges) que representam o comportamento dinâmico do sistema.

When working with data structures like lists or NumPy arrays in Python,

the standard print or pprint, or even external tools like rich, often fail to provide a clear view of the entire structure,

especially when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or deeply nested data, making it easy to lose track of which element corresponds to which.
Let's consider the following example as an illustration.
sample = [
    {"user": {"id": 1, "name": "Alice", "scores": [95, 88, 76]}},
    {"user": {"id": "002b", "name": "Bob", "scores": [72, 85, 90]}},
    {"bug_user": {"id": [3], "name": "Charlie", "scores": [100, [50, 40], 70]}},

According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets. 
Excerpt from Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report. Source: Tether
According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

In an interview with Cointelegraph's Sam Bourgi at Token2049, Elissar said that stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, the intersection between AI and crypto, alternative use cases such as decentralized science, and Web3 gaming were all niches the company is exploring.
Gaming is "part of our DNA," the executive said before reflecting on the current state of the Web3 gaming industry:

“I think it’s a missed opportunity,” Independent Reserve founder Adrian Przelozny told Cointelegraph. “Neither side has made crypto a headline issue because they’re wary of polarizing voters or sounding too niche.”
But the good news is that after more than a decade of inaction, both the ruling Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the opposition Liberal Party are promising to enact crypto regulations developed in consultation with the industry. 
In April, Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor promised to release draft crypto regulations within the first 100 days after taking office, while the Treasury itself h…]]></summary>

According to reporting from Inner City Press, a judge sentenced Eisenberg to 52 months in prison at a May 1 hearing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case was filed in April 2024 after Eisenberg’s 2023 indictment on fraud for the Mango Markets exploit.
Eisenberg was initially scheduled to be sentenced in July 2024 following his guilty plea on the child porn charge. In May 2024, the judge suggested the sentencing for both cases would occur simultaneously in a consolidated proceeding. However, as of May 1, the fraud sentencing remains …]]></summary>

Michael Saylor's Bitcoin-buying firm Strategy, formerly MicroStrategy, has reported earning a year-to-date yield of 13.7% on its Bitcoin holdings as it missed Wall Street's first-quarter estimates.
The company said in its May 1 earnings statement that its year-to-date Bitcoin (BTC) yield equates to a gain of more than 61,000 BTC, worth approximately $5.8 billion. Bitcoin yield and gain are unofficial accounting metrics Strategy uses to benchmark the success of its BTC buys. 
Strategy’s chief financial officer, Andrew Kang, said it would increase its Bitcoin yield target for this year to 25% and its Bitcoin gain target to $15 billion.

In a May 1 letter to Stephen Ehikian, the acting administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) — the entity responsible for managing the US government’s properties — Rep. Lance Gooden claimed that introducing crypto ATMs to federal buildings would serve as an “educational resource” and reflect advances in financial technology.

"Every retail user should be thinking about getting at least one Bitcoin — very soon they won’t be able to afford it,” Kunz said. 
If the United States starts buying Bitcoin for a strategic reserve, even smaller countries may soon struggle to acquire the cryptocurrency, he added. "I’m pretty sure we’ll soon see countries battling over who owns more Bitcoin. The US will start.”

Ten years ago, the state created the United States’ first comprehensive regulatory framework for firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, including key consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity guidelines.
In September 2015, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) issued its first BitLicense to Circle Internet Financial, enabling the company to conduct digital currency business activity in the state. Ripple Markets received the second BitLicense in 2016. Circle and Ripple went on to become giant players in the global cryptocurrency and stablecoin industry.

Bitcoin pressures shorts after 3% daily gains
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $96,955 on Bitstamp, its highest since Feb. 22.
Increasingly close to six figures, Bitcoin rose with US stocks at the Wall Street open as Microsoft gained 10% to become the world’s highest-valued public company.
Reacting, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades suggested that stocks may be on the cusp of a return to sustained bullish trajectory.
“Stocks trade at a key area here,” he wrote in ongoing X analysis.

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The demand for yield-generating strategies around Bitcoin (BTC) is surging, especially from firms seeking liquidity without liquidating their BTC, according to Ryan Chow, co-founder and CEO of Solv Protocol.
During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Amid the intensifying global race to tokenize real-world assets, the market is still too nascent for institutional adoption, according to Chris Yin, the co-founder and CEO of Galaxy-backed RWA platform Plume.
Institutional capital is yet to enter the RWA market, and it will take some time for institutions to see its value, Yin told Cointelegraph on the sidelines of Token2049 in Dubai.
“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

According to a May 1 Bloomberg report, the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026.

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

With the explosion of remote work, IoT devices, and public connectivity, MITM attacks are more relevant than ever. For developers, IT professionals, and security teams, the danger lies in the illusion of secure communication.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Conditional Rendering?


In React, conditional rendering allows you to dynamically render different UI components based on certain conditions. You can use JavaScript logic such as if statements, the ternary operator (? :), the logical AND (&&), or assign JSX to variables.
Using if Statements


The simplest way to conditionally render components is by using if statements inside a function component.
Example:





function AlertMessage({ show }) {
  if (!show) {
    return null;
  }
  return <p className="alert">This is an alert message!</p>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <AlertMessage show={true} />;
}

In this example, if show is false, the component returns null and nothing is rendered.
Using Ternary Operator (? :)

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

Have you ever run a SQL query that just took forever and wondered, "Why is this so slow?" You're not alone. Databases are fast until they're not. And one of the simplest, yet most powerful performance tricks in SQL is indexing.
What indexing really means in MySQL 


Why indexes are performance game changers


The exact results of an experiment we ran on 80,000+ records in 


MySQL 5.7 on a local setup (8GB RAM, SSD)


When indexing helps and when it doesn't



Let's dive in.

Think of an index like a book's table of contents. If you need Chapter 8, you don't flip through every single page you jump straight to it. That's what MySQL does with an index.

Hello everyone! Welcome to the second entry in my reading journey series. This time I have managed to read only 5 books. While I’m a little bit behind on my Goodreads goal of reading 52 books in the year, the last couple of months have been very busy with the end of the academic winter term. Now that I’m done with classes, I’m sure that I can have more time for reading and hopefully catch up to my goal. Let’s go into the reviews for this entry!

I briefly mentioned in the last entry that I was starting to read a collection of Celtic fairy tales and lore that my dad gifted me for Christmas. The first book in this collection is Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland by Lady Wilde. It contains a varied recollection of folklore and fairy tales.
Overall, I liked…]]></summary>

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

After doing my first job as a frontend engineer in a startup for an year, I left my job. Their are multiple reasons for it, but that was the story of another time.
After that I decided to not pursue the tech career and start my chocolate factory - HAKI, a chocolate spread idea that crossed my mind.


If anyone is thinking, why making a chocolate spread would be so hard, like I thought initially, my 1st two variants caught fungus within a week.

Long time, messaging a hundred people for advice and many failed attempts, now I'm here finally — with the most delicious recipe made using clean, wholesome ingredients to keep it truly healthy.
Ahh and please follow Haki on @eathaki_ to know more about it.

We're still on the lookout for a graphic designer who's excited to help build HAKI — feel free to drop me an email if someone comes to mind.
Thank you so much for reading it till here 😊

Also, if there's a better place to share this, please let me know.]]></summary>

I previously served as the General Secretary of an association based in Brisbane. Throughout the year, we host around three events where professional photographers capture numerous high-quality images. Some of these photos can be as large as 18MB.
Once the events conclude, the pictures need to be uploaded to Google Albums and shared with our community. At our most recent event, the total upload size reached 5GB.
I had previously implemented an image resizer in php which I executed by running
php process.php imageprocessing <input-folder> [<output-folder> [<size>]]

The files in the input folder were processed sequentially, which worked well for a small number of images and for smaller file sizes—around 5MB.

"I think freedom of money is important, but to have freedom of money, you have to have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is kind of the bottom line. If you don't have that, nothing — no other freedom — works."

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…]]></summary>

Bitcoin’s price increased by sixfold each time its age increased by 40%.

If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could rally to $351,046 in 2025.

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

Tether’s flagship stablecoin, USDT (USDT), is already the US dollar’s top “exporter,” Ardoino told CNBC. It has a market capitalization of nearly $150 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. 
Now, Tether is preparing to expand into the US market “by the end of this year or early next year, at the fastest,” Ardoino said, adding that the timing depends on US lawmakers’ progress on stablecoin legislation. 
The stablecoin issuer is working to woo US regulators by proactively collaborating with law enforcement and highlighting USDT’s benefits for the US economy.

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.
Despite the dismal price action, dismissing Ethereum as a relic may be premature. The network continues to evolve, and th…]]></summary>

According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally.

In an exclusive interview, Markova described the competition with dollar-pegged stablecoins as “all about sovereignty.” She compared the situation to earlier tensions between governments and US payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamic with stablecoins — on a smaller scale for now — but they’re definitely emerging as a new arena for sovereign concerns,” she said.

US GDP shrank -0.3% in Q1, far below +0.3% forecasts, sparking recession fears.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023.

Speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on April 30, Zhao said that areas of the United Arab Emirates were “extremely pro-business,” leading to crypto adoption in Dubai, while others like Bhutan were building national Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) stockpiles. According to Zhao, the US was pressing other countries’ hands by exploring its own policies for a crypto reserve, but those in Europe didn’t seem to be reacting.
“I don’t see Europe in this discussion,” said Zhao, highlighting one exception. “Montenegro is actually quite pro-crypto. We had an active dialogue with [the] prime minister there, and he’s a very forward-thin…]]></summary>

US GDP shrank in Q1, raising recession alarms while also prompting calls for Fed rate cuts.

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support. 

Today’s crypto derisking is likely transitory; market fundamentals remain strong.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…]]></summary>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it. 
This is not the first time products have been revealed to be inauthentic, with the Honey Authenticity Network highlighting that one-third of all honey products were fak…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Chinese artificial intelligence development company DeepSeek has released a new open-weight large language model (LLM).
DeepSeek uploaded its newest model, Prover V2, to the hosting service Hugging Face on April 30. The latest model, released under the permissive open-source MIT license, aims to tackle math proof verification.

Prover V2 has 671 billion parameters, making it significantly larger than its predecessors, Prover V1 and Prover V1.5, which were released in August 2024. The paper accompanying the first version explained that the model was trained to translate math competition problems into formal logic using the Lean 4 programming language — a tool widely used for proving theorems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin released another update on what he believes the future of the network should entail.
In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy.
The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Crypto was born from an open-source ethos, where code was shared publicly, accessible for review and shaped by community contributions. Transparency and verifiability are foundational principles that enable trust in Bitcoin.
But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…]]></summary>

Transient failures: An external service might be slow or unreachable for a brief moment.
Partial outages: Another system could be in maintenance mode, limiting your access.
Network instability: Users with slow internet connections might experience short outages or timeouts.
Overloaded service: Another service could be overloaded with requests, leading to slow responses.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a modern approach to provisioning cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or OpenTofu. These technologies improve scalability, repeatability, and automation—but they can also introduce security risks if the code is misconfigured. For example, exposing an S3 bucket to the public or disabling encryption can lead to serious data breaches.
This article introduces CoGuard, a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool designed specifically to analyze configuration files used in infrastructure code. We’ll demonstrate how to scan Terraform code, interpret results, and automate the scanning process in a CI/CD workflow.

Firefox is a powerful, free, and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. The journey of Firefox began in **2002, when it was initially launched under the name *“Phoenix”. Due to trademark conflicts, it was later renamed *“Firebird”, and finally, in **2004, it became known as *“Firefox”*.
The main objective was to offer a lightweight, secure, and flexible browser alternative to the then-dominant Internet Explorer. Firefox quickly became popular due to its faster performance, tabbed browsing, and support for third-party **extensions (add-ons).
Over time, Firefox introduced several innovations such as:
Private Browsing Mode

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the cloud-native era, where speed, scalability, and automation dominate, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has emerged as a critical practice for DevOps and platform engineering teams. Tools like Terraform, Pulumi, and OpenTofu allow infrastructure to be defined, versioned, and deployed with the same rigor as application code.
But just like any other code, infrastructure code is prone to security misconfigurations, errors, and vulnerabilities. A single misconfigured security group or publicly accessible storage bucket can result in devastating data breaches. This is where SAST tools for IaC play a vital role.
Among the many open-source tools available, KICS (Keeping Infrastructure as Code Secure) stands out for its breadth of support, ease of use, and community-driven rules engine. In this a…]]></summary>

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, 2025 has ushered in a paradigm shift known as vibe coding. Coined by AI researchers, vibe coding represents a transition from traditional, syntax-heavy programming to a more intuitive, AI-assisted approach where developers articulate their intentions in natural language, and AI tools generate the corresponding code.
At its core, vibe coding is about conveying the desired functionality or behavior of software through conversational prompts. Instead of meticulously writing out code line by line, developers describe what they want the software to do, and AI models translate these descriptions into executable code. This method emphasizes clarity of thought and design over manual co…]]></summary>

Will AI Take My Job?
Anita Olsen ・ Apr 22
#discuss
        #ai
      
Sure, we code daily and AI shines at spitting out code. But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.
Apart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:
Inter-team planning
Brainstorming sessions
Putting late sprints back on track
Designing requirements and user stories
Decomposing a full project into milestones
Scoping tasks with Product people
Reviewing architecture designs
Negotiating deadlines
Talking to clients
And that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn't surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can't replace that human interaction yet.
But sure, our job as coders will change. Even if we're skeptical about AI, we can't ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us. We have to adapt.
We won't be code monkeys anymore, cracking lines of code in exchange for bananas. AI will handle that. And if AI will change everything, let it at least kill dumb SCRUM ceremonies.

Austin federal court judge Robert Pitman said in an April 28 judgment that OFAC’s sanctions on Tornado Cash were unlawful and that the agency was “permanently enjoined from enforcing” sanctions.
Tornado Cash users led by Joseph Van Loon had sued the Treasury, arguing that OFAC’s addition of the platform’s smart contract addresses to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list was “not in accordance with law.” 
OFAC had sanctioned Tornado Cash in August 2022, accusing the protocol of helping launder crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking collective, the Lazarus Group.

Richard Byworth says Michael Saylor’s Strategy could ramp up its Bitcoin buys by acquiring cash-rich companies and converting their cash into Bitcoin.

He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline.

Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy’s mNAV, benefiting shareholders.

Michael Saylor’s Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says.
“Saylor’s strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast.

Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.

If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.

Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening. 
According to a US Labor Department JOLTS report released on April 29, job openings in March approached their lowest levels in four years. US employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, below the…]]></summary>

The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession.
The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours.

Fidelity Digital Assets says Bitcoin is undervalued and the firm holds an optimistic mid-term outlook.

The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. 

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” 
As proof,  the firm cited the ‘Bitcoin Yardstick’ metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network. 
In Q1 2025, the metric stayed between -1 and 3 standard deviations, cooling from its Q4 2024 overheated levels. The number of days above 2-standard deviations dropped from 22 to 15, …]]></summary>

In its April 2025 Financial Stability Report, the Bank of Italy flags crypto volatility and rising integration with the broader economy, singling out stablecoins and non-financial firms’ crypto exposure as key concerns.
"The strong growth of Bitcoin and of other crypto-assets with high price volatility means risks not only for investors but also potentially for financial stability, given the growing interconnections between the digital asset ecosystem, the traditional financial sector and the real economy,” the report notes.

In an April 29 hearing of the High Court of Karnataka, Justice M Nagaprasanna ordered the government to “block forthwith” domain names associated with Proton Mail, citing authority under the country’s Information Technology Act of 2008. The order stemmed from a complaint filed in January by a New Delhi-based design firm, alleging that some of its employees received offensive emails through the service.  
It’s unclear whether the ban will take effect or face other possible challenges in court. The Proton team reported in March 2024 that Indian authorities had similarly proposed ordering the service blocked in response to alleged “hoax bomb threats,”…]]></summary>

In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors’ inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Update (April 29 at 8:54 pm UTC): This article has been updated to include comments from Bunq's CEO to Cointelegraph. 
Europe’s second-largest neobank, Bunq, is expanding into cryptocurrency, citing growing retail investor demand for digital assets worldwide.
The Amsterdam-based neobank announced the launch of Bunq Crypto on April 29, a new offering enabling its users to invest in over 300 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL).
Starting April 29, Bunq users in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Belgium will be able to access cryptocurrencies directly through the Bunq app, according to an announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways: 

Fidelity Digital Assets’ report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum's layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.
The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin’s favor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The United States exchange Nasdaq has asked regulators for permission to list a 21Shares exchange-traded fund (ETF) holding the popular memcoin Dogecoin, regulatory filings show. 
The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF, shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Polkadot (DOT). 
Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund. The request amounts to a regulatory review process that could determine whether Dogecoin becomes accessible to a broader range of investors through an ETF structure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency compliance firm Bitrace found that $649 billion worth of stablecoins flowed through addresses classified as high-risk in 2024, according to an April 29 report.
Bitrace defines high-risk blockchain addresses as those used by illegal entities to receive, transfer or store stablecoins.
Crypto compliance firms typically score crypto wallet addresses based on their likelihood of involvement in illicit activities. The higher the risk, the higher the likelihood of foul play, and the less likely compliant crypto businesses are to accept the assets.
Per the report, the amount accounted for roughly 5.14% of all stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. This is down 0.8% from 5.94% the previous year, but significantly higher than the 2.8% reported in 2022 and 1.63% in 2021.

XRP trades over 120% above its realized price, flashing heightened correction risk.

A rising wedge breakdown on the 4H chart could send XRP toward $1.89 by mid-May.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.  
“I can feel it in my bones, $2,000 ETH coming fast.”

Global CBDC projects have not failed, but they have also not become what they were anticipated to be, according to Olga Goncharova, CEO at the consulting firm Rizz Go and former director of government relations in the Commonwealth of Independent States at Binance.
“CBDCs were conceived as a technological breakthrough, but so far they look like expensive imitations of existing traditional fiat currencies that citizens and businesses already use through online banking and payment apps,” Goncharova told Cointelegraph at the Blockchain Forum in Moscow.

Still, crypto markets have shown some resilience and cause for optimism in the administration’s crypto-friendly policies. A number of pro-crypto leaders have been appointed to key government agencies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Tra…]]></summary>
