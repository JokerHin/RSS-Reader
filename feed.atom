        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price rallied by 22% on May 8, but demand for spot ETH ETFs and derivatives remains muted. 

President Trump’s reversal on certain altcoins aligns with ETH’s renewed outlook. 

Ether (ETH) posted an impressive 29% gain between May 8 and May 9, likely marking the end of a 10-week bear market that bottomed out at $1,385 on April 9. This sharp move triggered the liquidation of over $400 million in short (sell) ETH futures positions, suggesting that whales and market makers were caught off guard.
Despite the surge, traders have maintained a neutral stance in ETH derivatives. Whether this apparent lack of conviction reflects a genuine trend reversal or merely precedes another test of the $2,000 level remains to be seen.

Both handle asynchronous operations, but have different purposes:
Future: returns a single value in the future.


Stream: returns a sequence of values ​​over time.

A common challenge arises when a proxied server, such as Keycloak, issues a redirect response that strips these important parameters. This article explores how to effectively capture and forward query parameters using Nginx and Lua, offering a practical solution to your business requirement.
Understanding the Problem
Redirects can be tricky, particularly with status codes like 302 that don’t maintain the query parameters sent to the original request. In your case, after the following steps:
Client requests an authorization code from Keycloak.
Keycloak returns a 302 redirect, losing essential query parameters.

At my company, we still don’t have a proper tool to manage secrets. So, naturally, people come up with their own solutions—some of them not very secure.
I had the idea of using AWS Secrets Manager as a secure place to store our secrets. But there was a challenge:
Then I discovered that a single AWS Secret can store up to 64KB, which is more than enough for a bunch of simple strings.
That got me thinking...
So I did it! :)

If you’ve ever been confused by LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, and FULL OUTER JOIN, this article will clear it up once and for all—with examples, visuals, and real-life reasoning.
Let’s get you from novice to JOIN Jedi.
JOINs allow you to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Think of them as building bridges between datasets.
The four most commonly used JOINs in SQL are:
INNER JOIN
LEFT JOIN
RIGHT JOIN
FULL OUTER JOIN
Each has its own behavior for matching and preserving data from the joined tables.

However, TS didn't like it...
// não bom

args.forEach((arg) => {

                // A spread argument must either

The problem is that doSomething expects one to three arguments of type string, but arg is typed as string[]. We need to narrow the type down, to match the arguments of doSomething()
// bom
const properTypedArgs: [a: string, b?: string, c?: string][] = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'b'], ['a']];
properTypedArgs.forEach((arg) => {
    doSomething(...arg);

This works, but if you don't fancy re-typing the function's argument type defs or don't have it handy, TS utility type got you covered:
// ainda melhor
const properTypedArgs: Parameters<typeof doSomething>[] = [['a', 'b', 'c'], ['a', 'b'], ['a']];

You spend hours crafting the perfect feature, hit "Load Unpacked," and… nothing happens. Or worse—your extension works on your machine but turns into a pumpkin 🎃 on your friend’s browser.  
Debugging extensions can feel like wrestling gremlins, but don’t panic! I’ve been there (and lived to tell the tale). Let’s break down the most common errors and their fixes so you can get back to shipping magic.  
1. “My Extension Doesn’t Load!” (Manifest File Mayhem)


The Error: Chrome/Firefox ignores your extension, or you get a cryptic “Invalid manifest” warning.  
Why It Happens:  
Manifest Version Mismatch: Using V2 syntax in a V3 world (or vice versa).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today's question
Create a React application that allows users to create, display and delete blog posts.
Solution
The first step is to evaluate the boilerplate provided. There are 3 boilerplate files:
Home.js
import React from "react";
import Input from "./Input";
import PostDisplay from "./PostDisplay";

function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="text-center ma-20">
      <div className="mb-20">
        <Input />
        <button data-testid="create-button" className="mt-10">
          Create Post
        </button>
      </div>
      <div className="posts-section">
        <PostDisplay />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;

Input.js
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Input() {
  return (
    <div className="layout-column justify-content-center align-items-center">
      <input className="w-100" type="text" 
      placeholder="Enter Title" value={"Title"} data-testid="title-input" />
      <textarea className="mt-10 w-100"
      placeholder="Enter Description" value={"Description"} data-testid="description-input" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Input;


PostDisplay.js
import React from "react";

function PostDisplay() {
  return (
    <div data-testid="posts-container" className="flex wrap gap-10">
      <div className="post-box">
        <h3>{"Title"}</h3>
        <p>{"Description"}</p>
        <button>Delete</button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default PostDisplay;


The Home component(file) is provided as the parent component, which manages the state of the application. So, variable states for all blog posts, and a single new blog post will be created. The input component is responsible for creating new blog posts, therefore, the variable states for new blogs will be passed into it after it has been created in the Home component. Then, the PostDisplay component, which handles showing all blog posts, will have the state for all blog posts passed into it.]]></summary>

If you're feeling overwhelmed by the programming challenges and specifically by your container colorization logic, you're not alone! In this article, we will go through how to successfully manage color changes for your start and end containers without affecting all elements on the grid.
Understanding the Problem
In your Flutter application, the objective is to select a 'start' and 'end' container when clicking on the grid, and change their colors accordingly. However, when you try to set the 'start' container color to green, it’s inadvertently updating every container to green, which is not the intended behavior.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to share a very quick on something I learned that was pretty useful to me, so thought it might be useful to others. Here is a scenario that some of you might be familiar with:
You have a successful Amazon Q Developer session, and then maybe a few days later, you are trying to recall exactly what you did and how you put your prompts together - what can you do?
As it turns out, a recent update to Amazon Q Developer was a big help. In the Amazon Q Developer chat interface, there is a new icon next to the different tabs (its an icon of a click, which when you hover over says "View Chat History") which when you click on this, it will bring back a list of previous chats that have been recorded. What does this mean? 
In the "~/.aws/amazonq/" directory there is a "history" directory, and looking at it, it contains a number of time/date stamped json files.
├── history
│   ├── chat-history-0f97086b54fd7d6128dfd80426dfd63d.json
│   ├── chat-history-10d817f64fc99f04badf1568a6c23814.json
│   ├── chat-history-deba93a681a17ae26ff2b977acf0ba97.json
│   ├── chat-history-fa5091a7425e7938fe770a584b63076e.json
│   └── chat-history-no-workspace.json


These are what the Amazon Q Developer VSCode plugin now produces as you start using it. 
That said, because I had deleted my project, and so I was unable to get this from VSCode itself. Aarrgh, I thought to myself. Not to worry though. I still had the files in the history directory. So reviewing these with my favourite json viewer (I knew  which file to use, aligning date stamps from these and the code files in my project workspace), allowed me to extract all the history, including prompts and responses. Very handy to know if you want to go back in time.

This saved me, so hoping it will help others who are looking to recover what they did.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I started writing code, I thought the goal was perfection.
A flawless feature. A zero-bug release. The cleanest, DRYest, most elegant solution to every problem.
But if there’s one thing software engineering teaches you—again and again—it’s this: Perfect doesn’t ship. Progress does.
Behind every product you love, every app you use daily, and every "it-just-works" moment, there’s a messy history of trade-offs, iterations, rewrites, and late-night breakthroughs. There’s never been a perfect version—only the best version for right now.
“If you’re aiming for perfection, you’ll never release,” he says. “But if you aim for learning, you’ll improve with every commit.”
That’s the shift that happens when you grow—not just as a coder, but as an engineer.
Early Career: Learning the Rules
Most engineers begin their journey by learning the rules.
Mid-Career: Building Beyond Code
As you gain experience, your job evolves. You're not just writing functions—you’re:
The Myth of Mastery
There’s a moment many engineers hit mid-career: you expect to feel confident, but instead, you feel behind.
Late Career: Scaling Impact
By the time you’re a senior or staff engineer, the problems you solve are rarely just technical.
Letting Go to Grow
So what does it really mean to grow as a software engineer?
Final Thoughts: We’re All Still Learning
No matter where you are in your career—just starting out, mid-level and unsure, or senior and scaling—remember this:
You don’t have to be perfect. You just have to keep learning.
Great software is built by people who care enough to try, fail, ask, share, and try again.
People like Abhishek Desikan, who show that engineering is not just about building products—it’s about building people, teams, and ethical systems that serve others well.
“We’re not just writing code,” Desikan reminds us. “We’re writing the story of how people experience technology.”
And when we do that with care—even if it’s not perfect—we’re already doing something right.]]></summary>

Solana's 15% surge and potential close above the 50-week EMA signal strong bullish momentum, which previously led to a 515% rally in 2024. 

The $120 million in liquidity bridged to Solana reflects growing network confidence.

Solana (SOL) price gained 18% this week, signaling rising bullish momentum. The altcoin is approaching a pivotal point, with a potential close above the 50-week exponential moving average (EMA), a level that has historically catalyzed significant rallies. 
In March, SOL dipped below the 50-week EMA and briefly dropped under $100 on April 7. Since then, Solana has staged a strong recovery, reclaiming key EMA levels (100W and 200W), with the 50-week EMA (blue line) now in focus.

Given an array of positive integers nums and a target integer target, our mission is to find the smallest contiguous subarray whose elements sum up to be greater than or equal to the target. If no such subarray exists, we return 0 (or some other indicator).
The most intuitive approach is to consider all possible subarrays. We can achieve this using nested loops:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like a lot of devs, I built a side project that scratched a personal itch: an invoice generator. But instead of going full SaaS startup mode, I treated it as a challenge—build something clean, useful, and fast, with a real login system, server-side PDF generation, and as little overhead as possible.
The result is InvoiceDen, a React-based web app hosted on Cloudflare Pages, with backend functionality on an EC2 instance, all for about $8/month.
Here’s what I learned architecting it on a shoestring budget — and how you can do something similar without spinning up Kubernetes or draining your wallet.
The app is split into a classic frontend + backend setup, but optimized for cost and simplicity.

The truth is, most cloud cost spikes don’t come from initial deployments, they come from what happens after. And if you don’t have visibility or automation in place, it’s easy to lose control.
Here’s what’s really driving those post-deployment cloud cost spikes and what you can do to stop them with the help of Kuberns.

Bitcoin holding $100,000 as a level of support would confirm the current trend change.

Ether leads among altcoins, and DeFi tokens could follow.

Bitcoin (BTC) broke above the psychologically critical $100,000 level on May 8, and the bulls are trying to hold on to the level on May 9. In an X post, CoinGlass said that Bitcoin’s rally resulted in $837.80 million in short liquidations in a 24-hour period, the largest since 2021.
Bitcoin’s rally also lifted several major altcoins, which soared above their respective overhead resistance levels. The altcoin rally was led by Ether (ETH), which surged roughly 22% on May 8, triggering a $328 million liquidation of Ether short positions.

Specifically, we want to retrieve the segment that comes after the /view/ part of the URL and before a numeric identifier. Using regular expressions in Perl is a powerful way to match and extract required content from strings easily.
Understanding the Problem
You have a URI that looks like this:
my $uri = "https://example.com/entry/#/view/TCMaftR7cPYyC3q61TnI6_Mx8PwDTsnVyo9Z6nsXHDRzrN5ftuXxHN7NvIGK34-z/366792786/aHR0cHM6Ly9lcGwuaXJpY2EuZ292LmlyL0ltZWlBZnRlclJlZ2lzdGVyP2ltZWk9MzU5NzQ0MzkxMDc2Mjg4";

From this string, you mentioned needing to extract the Base64 string:

But let’s be clear about something:

Google doesn’t rank your site based on your CMS!

Google doesn’t care if you’re using WordPress, Webflow, Drupal or your content is served from a Google Sheet.
Google doesn’t have a CMS bias built in. It doesn’t know how "clean" your CMS feels or cares about how many Yoast plugins you’ve installed. It only sees data. Numbers. Metrics. That's it.

Understanding the Connection Challenge
When migrating to a new infrastructure setup, especially to an AlwaysOn Availability Group, connection stability is crucial. In your case, where about 50% of connection attempts are timing out, there are a few probable causes:

So If you're familiar with docker containers so far (if not, read my previous two articles on this),
When there's more than 1 container, and they have to interact, there's some things you have to repeat, like:
pulling image & creating a container.
allocate volumes, pass ENV args, etc to container
have all containers running in same network
.

Now if there's 3,4,5,.. or more, it gets more hectic, see where this is going? Docker compose solves that, by "composing" up your containers config in a file type called "yaml" (its similar to json - a data format, usually for configs).
You still have things like Dockerfile and concepts of containers are the same, its just the process that's simpler.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're learning JavaScript, you've likely come across closures — a concept that's easy to overlook but incredibly powerful. In this post, I'll break down closures using a real-world coding example: computing Fibonacci numbers with memoization.
A closure is when a function remembers the variables from its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.
In other words, inner functions can "close over" variables defined in an outer function — keeping them alive between calls.
Let’s start with a simple (but inefficient) recursive Fibonacci implementation:
function fib(n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}

console.log(fib(10)); // 55

This works, but it's horribly inefficient for large n due to repeated calculations.
Let’s use a closure to store previously computed Fibonacci numbers (aka memoization) and avoid redundant work.
function createFibonacci() {
  const memo = {};

  function fib(n) {
    if (n in memo) {
      return memo[n]; // Return cached result
    }

    if (n <= 1) {
      memo[n] = n;
    } else {
      memo[n] = fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
    }

    return memo[n];
  }

  return fib;
}

const fibonacci = createFibonacci();

console.log(fibonacci(10)); // 55
console.log(fibonacci(50)); // 12586269025 — much faster due to caching!

memo is defined once inside createFibonacci() and persists across calls to fib() because of closure.
Even after createFibonacci() has returned, the fib() function still remembers the memo object.
This is the closure in action: the inner function keeps access to its outer scope.
Closures allow us to:
Preserve state across function calls without polluting the global scope.
Create factory functions like createFibonacci() that generate self-contained logic.
Enable powerful patterns like memoization, function factories, and data encapsulation.
Closures aren't just theoretical — they’re a practical tool for writing clean, efficient JavaScript. Have any cool uses of closures? Drop them in the comments!]]></summary>

Mesmo sendo uma linguagem extremamente poderosa — utilizada tanto no Front-End quanto no Back-End — no front-end o Vanilla JS tem um papel essencial: manipular o DOM (Document Object Model). Mas… como isso funciona na prática?

For the time.Time type, the zero value is "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z", which is not considered an empty value.
For a slice field like IntSlice []int, both [] and nil are considered empty values.

In the long term, global liquidity continues to expand, driven by the increasing debt levels in many countries.

On a shorter timeframe, global liquidity follows a cyclical pattern, with Michael Howell projecting the current cycle to peak by mid-2026.

Bitcoin (BTC) price is notoriously sensitive to global liquidity. Some analysts go as far as calling their correlation near-perfect, with a lag of about three months. This relationship is fueling the current bullish narrative as BTC price soars back above $100,000, but how long can this trend last?

A tired founder stares at a blank landing page and thinks: "Code, hosting, SEO, deployment—why so many moving parts?" That frustration sparked Vilcos.





  
  
  Chapter 1 — Foundations


Vilcos unites three modern stacks:
Chainlit + Agno – a model-agnostic AI co-developer that edits HTML/CSS/JS on demand.
Vite + Tailwind – hot-reload frontend workflow for instant feedback.
Docker + Fly.io – global deployment in a single command.
Workflow overview:
# Modern installation (new!)
npx create-vilcos-app my-website

# Standard operations
./vilcos start    # Live AI editing & preview
./vilcos publish  # Static build & SEO post-processing
./vilcos deploy   # Multi-stage Docker → Fly.io edge

Get started in seconds with npx create-vilcos-app my-website and a polished black-themed template appears, ready for conversation-driven edits.
Drag-and-drop builders limit creativity. Vilcos lets you talk to your site:
Ask – "Add a pricing table with three tiers."
See – Chainlit patches the code in seconds.
Refine – "Switch to dark mode." Immediate.
An embedded knowledge base keeps the AI grounded in your exact template files, avoiding hallucinations and ensuring output matches your site's existing structure.
Docker compiles; Caddy serves; Fly.io distributes.
Zero-config HTTPS and anycast IPs.
Add a CNAME in Cloudflare, run fly deploy, and you're online worldwide in under a minute.
Speed – Idea → live site in one sitting.
Simplicity – One repo, one CLI, no CI pipeline gymnastics.
Portability – Templates are plain files—take them anywhere.
Flexibility – Works with any AI model that Agno supports.
Accessibility – Install with a single command using the familiar npx pattern.
Join the project, open a chat with Vilcos, and build something remarkable.
Built with practical caffeine and a commitment to making the web faster to create.]]></summary>

It starts as a harmless reflex.
Someone drops a half-baked feature in sprint review, proudly demoing what amounts to a glorified loading spinner - and your brain whispers, “Seriously?” Another project dies on the vine, killed by the same meetings that birthed it, and you think, “Of course it did.” You’ve seen this show before.

Congratulations. You’ve unlocked senior cynicism.

Reflection is a powerful feature in Go that allows you to inspect and manipulate objects at runtime.

We will fix the example provided, ensuring that our code dynamically recognizes interface implementations without explicitly mentioning the structs.
The Problem with Your Reflection Code
In your provided code, you are encountering an 'ErrUnhandledType' error when trying to directly recognize the PrintStr interface during iteration. This occurs because the Field(i).Interface() method retrieves the value of the struct, not the pointer that implements the PrintS…]]></summary>

Lets start with levels of understanding. In the world of education, there is a helpful framework called "Bloom's Taxonomy" that breaks them down easily: 
Remembering
Understanding

Applying

Are you experiencing issues with Bootstrap buttons that don't behave as expected when expanding or collapsing comments within forms? You're not alone! This problem is commonly faced by developers who use Bootstrap's collapse functionality, especially when handling multiple forms on a single page. In this article, we will dive into why this issue occurs and provide a step-by-step solution to ensure that each button works exclusively within its respective form.
Understanding the Problem
The root of the issue lies in the way Bootstrap identifies collapse targets with class selectors. When you use a common class like multi-collapse for multiple buttons across different forms, Bootstrap mistakenly associates the collapse actions of the buttons with all elements sharing that class. …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Web Cache Deception is a vulnerability first described in 2017. It occurs when a caching system — such as a reverse proxy or CDN — can be tricked into caching sensitive, dynamic content that should only be delivered to authenticated users but ends up being publicly available. This is usually due to poorly thought-out or inconsistent configurations in how the cache interprets and stores different types of requests.
Many caching systems have simple rules for deciding what can and cannot be cached. A common pattern is to only cache "static" files — such as those ending in .js, .css, .png, .ico, etc. The problem arises when the cache relies solely on the structure of the URL path to make this decision, ignoring the actual behavior of the server behind it.

When your database starts groaning under load, two architectural strategies emerge as lifelines: partitioning and sharding. But they're not interchangeable—misusing them can make your scaling problems worse. Let's break them down technically.  
Partitioning: Splitting Data Within a Single Database


What it is:

Partitioning (often called horizontal partitioning) divides a table into smaller segments within the same database instance, based on a partition key (e.g., user_id, date).  
How it works:  
Range Partitioning: Data split by value ranges (date < '2023-01-01', date >= '2023-01-01').


List Partitioning: Explicit mappings (region IN ('east', 'west')).


Hash Partitioning: A hash function distribut…]]></summary>

In this article, we will dive into an efficient Go solution for the problem of finding the maximum score from two sorted arrays. This problem can often be found on competitive programming platforms, including LeetCode. We'll discuss the approach of using two pointers to solve the problem efficiently. Additionally, we will explore some optimizations that you can implement to ensure your code handles large inputs without facing overflow issues.
Why Do Overflow Issues Occur?
When working with large datasets, especially in programming languages like Go, it’s crucial to choose the right variable types. In the context of this problem, overflowing can happen if the computed sums exceed the limits of the data type used. Here, we are already using int64, which should be sufficient for …]]></summary>

I recently built Lite-Blockchain, a minimal yet functional blockchain implementation in Go. The goal was to demystify how blockchains work under the hood while leveraging Go’s simplicity and concurrency features. Let me walk you through what I learned!
Why Build a Blockchain in Go?
Key Features
Transaction System: Create and validate transactions.
Pure Go: No external dependencies—just the standard library.
Lightweight: Perfect for learning.
Code Snippets
go

    Timestamp    int64

    Transactions []*Transaction

    PrevHash     []byte

    Hash         []byte

    Nonce        int

}

And how transactions are added:
go

    tx := NewTransaction(sender, recipient, amount)

    bc.PendingTransactions = append(bc.PendingTransactions, tx)

}

Why Go for Blockchain?
Performance: Faster than interpreted languages like Python.
Simplicity: Explicit error handling and no inheritance headaches.
Try It Out!

Run the example:

In this blog, we'll walk through how to do this efficiently in a React Native app with support for both iOS and Android.
A simple React Native component that:
Detects the platform (iOS or Android),
Attempts to open the native app store using a deep link,
Falls back to the browser URL if the native store app is unavailable.
Here's the complete example:
import {StyleSheet, Text, View, Linking, Platform, Button} from 'react-native';
import React from 'react';

Understanding the Problem
When developing a responsive navbar, you may face issues with displaying it in a user-friendly manner, especially on smaller screens.

Bitcoin is driven by its ability to perform well in risk-on and risk-off environments, according to Bitcoin Suisse. 

Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio of 1.72, second only to gold, underscores its maturity as an asset, offering superior risk-adjusted returns.

A buyer-dominant market signals strong institutional and retail interest that could drive a supply squeeze and break new highs in May. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price breached the $100,000 mark for the first time since January, fueling speculation of a new all-time high above $110,000 in May. According to Bitcoin Suisse, a crypto custody service provider, BTC’s bullish momentum stems from its ability to thrive in risk-on and risk-off environments since the US presidential elections.

We've all experienced institutions — colleges, companies, organizations — where management collects feedback.
But when it comes to submitting complaints, the process often feels tedious, intimidating, or unclear.
Sometimes it's so complicated that people just give up.
Even if you do manage to submit a complaint, there's no guarantee you won’t face backlash from the administration or individuals involved.
⚡ I wanted to solve this.
I wanted to make a transparent and safe feedback process where:
The admin can invite people to submit feedback or complaints,
But the identity of the user remains hidden,
Ensuring honest feedback without fear.
Thus, I built an Anonymous Feedback Backend system.
From what I’ve seen, feedback is often collected using tools like Google Forms.

I wanted to test out all the available options I could find to see for myself. So first I searched and was able to find these libs:

Understanding Clang-Format Behavior
Clang-format is designed to enforce consistency in code style, which often leads to unexpected formatting changes. The situation you described, where struct definitions are condensed into single lines when they could be multi-line, is a common frustration among developers.
When you have a structure defined as:
typedef struct {
    a,
    b,

Clang-format may alter it to:

Son yıllarda yazılım geliştirme süreçlerinde bir değişim dalgası yükseliyor: “Vibe Coding”. Temel fikir şu: Her satırı kodu elle yazmak yerine, doğru “vibes” (yönlendirmeler) vererek AI destekli araçlardan yardım alıyoruz. Böylece tekrarlayan işler otomatikleşiyor, biz de strateji, mimari ve kullanıcı deneyimine odaklanabiliyoruz.
Vibe Coding, doğal dilde verdiğiniz talimatlarla (prompts) AI ajanların kodun önemli parçalarını sizin yerinize üretmesini sağlayan bir yaklaşım. Örneğin 
“Responsive bir navigasyon menüsü oluştur”

“Form validasyonunu JavaScript ile ekle”
Öne çıkan özellikleri:
Yüksek seviye komutlarla çalışma: “Ne yapmak istediğinizi” anlatırsınız, satır satır kodu AI üstlenir.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Ruby on Rails applications, the Pundit gem is widely used for managing authorization through policies. Recently, many developers have encountered problems when transitioning from Ruby 2.7 to Ruby 3.x, particularly with the behavior of the authorize helper method. This article explores how to effectively resolve those issues related to namespaced policies in Ruby 3.
Understanding the Issue
The main challenge arises from changes in Ruby 3 regarding keyword arguments. Whereas in Ruby 2.7, using keyword arguments was fairly lenient, Ruby 3 introduced stricter rules. This impacts the Pundit authorize method, specifically when dealing with keyword arguments, as certain configurations are being ignored under the new language rules.
For example, a common pattern involves overriding the authoriz…]]></summary>

Twenty years in the IT trenches has taught me one thing: developers will always gravitate toward tools that are both powerful AND simple to use. Go Fiber checks both boxes with bold strokes. If REST APIs were cars, then Go Fiber would be a Tesla Roadster - blazing fast, efficiently designed, and turning heads in the developer community. Let me show you how to get behind the wheel and build a REST API that will make your fellow devs green with envy.
Remember when setting up a web server meant writing hundreds of lines of configuration? Pepperidge Farm remembers. But Fiber is here to save the day with a clean, Express-inspired API that's ridiculously easy to get started with.

The $1.25-billion acquisition of Hidden Road on April 8 allows Ripple to use RLUSD as collateral in the firm’s prime brokerage products. Hidden Road will also migrate its post-trade operations to the XRP Ledger, the blockchain that underpins cryptocurrency XRP (XRP) and several of Ripple’s institutional services.
Omni Network founder and CEO Austin King knows Ripple’s strategy firsthand. He sold his startup, Strata Labs, to Ripple in 2019 and describes the approach as a “SoftBank-type” acquisition strategy.

Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have become the default hardware for many AI workloads, especially when training large models. That thinking is everywhere. While it makes sense in some contexts, it's also created a blind spot that's holding us back.
GPUs have earned their reputation. They're incredible at crunching massive numbers in parallel, which makes them perfect for training large language models or running high-speed AI inference. That's why companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta spend a lot of money building GPU clusters.
While GPUs may be preferred for running AI, we cannot forget about Central Processing Units (CPUs), which are still very capable. Forgetting this could be costing us time, money, and opportunity.

This article explores how to manage excessive validator messages gracefully and cleanly, giving user-friendly feedback without cluttering the interface.
Understanding the Problem
When displaying validator errors, the typical approach involves listing all the error messages directly below the input field. In scenarios with multiple errors, this can lead to overflowing content that disrupts the layout and makes it difficult for us…]]></summary>

Oi! Eu sou o Gustavo — desenvolvedor back-end, apaixonado por Java, Python, automações, arquitetura de software e, mais recentemente, por aplicar IA em projetos práticos. Resolvi começar minha jornada de escrita técnica por aqui, compartilhando um pouco das experiências e aprendizados com os projetos que venho criando por conta própria.
Sempre acreditei que a melhor forma de aprender é botando a mão na massa: errando, ajustando e resolvendo problemas do mundo real. Então, além de explorar novas ferramentas, decidi também documentar esse caminho — vai que isso ajuda alguém ou rende boas conversas por aqui.

Integration testing ensures that your backend API, database, and frontend work together as expected. In a Next.js + tRPC + Kysely/Prisma project, you can test the flow from database to API to UI by mocking or spinning up real services in-memory.
This guide covers:
Mocking tRPC hooks in frontend tests
Mocking the database layer for backend tests
Using mysql-memory-server for in-memory MySQL
Alternatives: pg-mem (PostgreSQL), in-memory SQLite
Automatically calculating tRPC procedure paths for integration tests
When testing React components that use tRPC hooks, you often want to control the responses returned by the API without running a real backend.

One of the hottest current topics is something called Vibe Coding. But what’s behind this term that’s dividing opinions—praised by some as revolutionary, dismissed by others as “total garbage”?
The term Vibe Coding was coined in February 2025 by computer scientist Andrej Karpathy, co-founder of OpenAI and former AI lead at Tesla. He described it as a conversation-based approach where spoken commands are used while an Artificial Intelligence (AI) generates the actual code. Karpathy himself said:
It's not really coding - I just see things, say things, run things, and copy-paste things, and it mostly works.

It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. With the DOM, HTML elements become objects, and you can manipulate them using JavaScript.
The DOM allows web developers to:
Access and update the content of a webpage.
Change styles and attributes dynamically.
Add or remove HTML elements on the fly.
Respond to user interactions like clicks, typing, or scrolling.
When a browser loads a web page, it creates a DOM tree where every element, attribute, and piece of text becomes a node.

Here’s a weird truth:
Most developers aren’t broke because they can’t code.

Let me say it loud:
You’re not YC. You’re not a pitch deck. You’re not a fundraising round.
You’re a developer.

Let’s get to the real way devs make money online (and it’s not building another SaaS with a dark mode toggle).
Devs be like:
“Let me finish auth before I tell anyone about my idea.”
“I just need to integrate payments, fix this bug, refactor the backend, clean the UI…”

Scott said the vote, which failed to reach cloture in the Senate, was expected to mark a step toward greater affordability and innovation. Instead, he said, political divisions took precedence.  
“Instead, we witnessed a disappointing display of political gamesmanship that puts partisan politics above policy, and obstruction above innovation,“ Scott said.
The bill had previously undergone multiple amendments to address concerns raised by Democrats, including stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers and further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.

In this blog, we’ll explore why knowing your audience matters more than your design, and how that knowledge helps you build a website that actually works.
Yes, a clean and professional design makes a good first impression. But think about this: how many times have you visited a good-looking website and left because it didn’t have what you were looking for?

If you are working with Windows Forms applications in Visual Studio 2022 and have recently transitioned to using .NET 8, you might encounter an unusual issue where your application unexpectedly closes when a menu control is clicked. This can be frustrating, especially when your earlier .NET version did not present such a problem. In this article, we will explore potential reasons behind this behavior and provide solutions to ensure your application runs smoothly on Linux Mint Bottles.
Understanding the Issue
To understand why your Windows Forms application is closing when clicking on the menu item, we can consider a few factors that might be influencing this behavior. Compatibility issues often arise when transitioning between different .NET versions, especially when running o…]]></summary>

If you are an XRP holder, XRPL developer, or XRPL ecosystem participant – stop and read this. You do have powers to influence the future. For everyone and especially yourself. And to do so, we will start by placing a veto on two amendments.
Right now, there are two amendments up for vote by UNL validators: Credentials and Permissioned Domains. These proposals are apparently focused on "institutions" for "institutional DeFi" – at least that is what's being publicly stated by the amendment initiators and their affiliates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Hey fellas 
I mean, it’s everywhere.
Well today, we’re going to understand that what is JSON actually , why it’s so popular, and where it's used.
Let’s get started!
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation.
It’s a lightweight format used to store and exchange data.
A simple format that computers and humans can both read easily.
{
  "name": "Selfish Dev",
  "gender": "male",
  "isGameDev": true,
  "tools": ["Godot", "Aseprite"]
}

That right there is a JSON object.
It uses key-value pairs (like name: "Selfish Dev")
Keys are always in quotes
Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or even other JSON objects
And that's what JSON is.
APIs(REST, GraphQL responses)


Configuration files (e.g., package.json in Node.js)


Storing structured data (NoSQL databases like MongoDB)


Data exchange between frontend & backend




  
  
  How to Use JSON in JavaScript:




Parse JSON string → Object:




const jsonString = '{"name": "Selfish", "gender": "male"}';
const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
console.log(obj.name); // Output: "Selfish"

Parse Object → JSON string :




const user = '{"name": "Selfish", "gender": "male"}';
const jsonString = JSON.stringify(user);
console.log(jsonString); // Output: '{"name": "Selfish", "gender": "male"}'

JSON is a fundamental tool in modern web development due to its simplicity and versatility.

Till then stay curios and stay selfish]]></summary>

  (All the following questions are just my personal opinions, and everyone is welcome to give me suggestions.)
  First, for beginners, is the local configuration of various databases (MySQL is used as an example here) too complicated? And various unpredictable errors may occur in this process.
  Secondly, after the developer configures the database on the local computer, he still needs to learn the relevant syntax (for example, after the developer configures MySQL, he still needs to learn the relevant syntax). Of course, learning SQL syntax is very necessary for programming developers. However, for a developer who wants to quickly experience or quickly develop a web application, spending time learning SQL (if he has not learned SQL) will reduce his development efficiency and desire to learn.
  Also, when the developer has configured SQL on his computer and learned SQL syntax, but when he wants to use it, it is better to call MySQL through python. At this time, he needs to use a third-party library like pymysql to call MySQL through the third-party library, but this may result in a series of errors.
  Finally, if you overcome the difficulties mentioned above and some difficulties that have not been mentioned, you will find that for developing a small project, developers will only use a small part of MySQL's functions, or even only some extremely simple functions such as query, delete, modify and insert.]]></summary>

In this article, we will tackle an issue where you need to shift the associated data recorded with each array element back into their correct positions after the filtering process. Let's explore how we can achieve this effectively.
Understanding the Problem
If you have a data structure where elements are associated with specific metadata, filtering the array can disrupt the connection between the data and the elements. For example, in your scenario, you have an original array:
const originalArray = [ 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j' ];

Introducing Drexel Bench, a smart IoT-powered seat occupancy tracking system developed using the ESP32 microcontroller to showcase my expertise in embedded systems, real-time data processing, and full-stack integration.
This project utilizes an ultrasonic sensor to detect the presence of a user within a configurable distance range (e.g., 75 cm). If a user remains seated for more than 30 seconds, the system activates a 15-minute countdown, displayed on a 1602 LCD module, and lights up a connected LED to visually signal that the seat is occupied. The LED turns off when the timer ends or the seat is unoccupied for 3 continuous minutes.
What sets this system apart is its Wi-Fi integration. Upon detecting occupancy or vacancy, the ESP32 sends status updates (occupied or free) via HTTP to a connected web application. The web dashboard dynamically switches between two images — a green layout for free seating and a red overlay for occupied — offering users a clear, real-time visual of availability.
This project highlights my capabilities in sensor integration, timer logic, ESP32 Wi-Fi programming, and frontend/backend interaction, making it a practical demonstration of end-to-end IoT development. Whether for smart campuses or waiting areas, this system delivers real-world utility through modern, scalable technology.]]></summary>

Definitions: A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass (also a base class or a parent class).
The idea of inheritance is simple but powerful: When you want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of the code that you want, you can derive your new class from the existing class.

If you are running a Go program that consistently increases in the number of goroutines and open file descriptors, but not in active network connections, you might be facing a potential leak with http.Client or http.Transport. In this article, we will explore how to diagnose this issue effectively and provide actionable steps to confirm whether these components are the source of the leaks.
Understanding Goroutines and Leaks in Go
The Go programming language utilizes goroutines for concurrent processing, which is lightweight and efficient. If you notice that the number of goroutines is increasing while active network connections are stable, it often signifies that they are not being managed or closed correctly. This can be caused by long-lived goroutines in the net/http package…]]></summary>

Large-scale frontend applications, like those seen in enterprise or SaaS platforms, demand thoughtful architecture, robust tooling, and clear conventions.
Here are battle-tested strategies to ensure your large frontend codebase remains sustainable and efficient:
A clear folder structure and separation of concerns can drastically improve maintainability.
Structure example:

├── features/
├── pages/
├── hooks/

But more often than not we have a need for generating and self-managing these Encryption keys, that maybe due to multiple reasons, maybe to enable/disable rotation period, have full access to key metadata and logs (or  perhaps the need to assert your dominance on AWS ;). 
So firstly how do these encryption keys work:
When we create a key (CMK) in AWS it generates a 256-bit AES key in a FIPS 140-2 validated HSM. This key never leaves the HSM for security.
Now when we want to encrypt any data AWS doesn't directly use the CMK for encyption as that would either have to be done in the secure environment or you have to expose the CMK to a insecure environment. So here com…]]></summary>

Routing refers to the process of navigating between different pages or views in a single-page application (SPA) without reloading the entire page.
It keeps the UI in sync with the current browser URL.
Allows us to build Single Page Applications (SPA).
React apps are SPAs, meaning there's only one HTML file (index.html), but multiple views (pages) that users can navigate to. Routing helps manage these views by matching the URL to the correct component.
It enables client-side navigation without full-page reloads, allowing users to move smoothly between URLs like /home, /about, or /contact, each displaying different components.
React doesn’t have built-in routing, so we use a library like React Router (react-router-dom) for handling routing.

ARJSON leverages bit-level optimizations to encode JSON at lightning speed while compressing data more efficiently than other self-contained JSON encoding/compression algorithms, such as MessagePack and CBOR.
MessagePack generates the smallest encoded data sizes among existing self-contained JSON serialization formats. However, ARJSON outperforms MessagePack in 90% of cases with random data, with the remaining 10% yielding nearly identical sizes. More importantly, for structured data with repetitive patterns and duplicate values, ARJSON far surpasses MessagePack, achieving up to around 95% better compression rates (20x smaller in size).
How could beating the current status quo even be possible at all, let alone by a wide margin?

Understanding the Issue
The Dir.mkdir method in Ruby is designed to create a single directory, not a full path. When you attempt to create a subdirectory without ensuring its parent directories exist, Ruby raises the Errno::ENOENT error.

In my previous post, I introduced a concept called VPS (Virtual Personality Structure).
It emerged from a question I kept returning to:
What if the key to better AI dialogue isn't about mimicking personality—but about structuring how it behaves?
In this article, I’d like to share a small piece of that idea—through a simple, hypothetical code snippet that illustrates one of its core components.
When faced with an ambiguous question or emotionally complex input from a user,
We may need a more structured way to assess how the system should behave.
python
if not_resolved(unknown):
    if can_resolve_immediately:
        respond_with_resolution()
    elif can_flag_as_non_critical:
        acknowledge_and_settle()
    elif can_return_later:
        defer_and_mark_spiral()
    else:
        hold_and_reflect()

This snippet outlines a possible decision process for handling uncertainty.
can_resolve_immediately: If the answer is clear, provide it directly.


can_flag_as_non_critical: If it’s safe to leave the question unresolved, acknowledge it and move on.


can_return_later: If it’s worth revisiting, defer the answer and mark it for later.


otherwise: If none of the above applies, pause and reflect without rushing to respond.



Rather than focusing solely on the content of a reply, this approach emphasizes the structure behind the decision.
This isn’t about making AI more “gentle” or overly accommodating.
why they choose a particular response at a particular moment.
When behavior is left vague, interpretation falls entirely on the user.
VPS isn’t a path to a “correct” answer.
I'm not an engineer or an AI expert.
Some parts of this perspective might miss certain technical nuances.
If so, I’d genuinely appreciate any thoughts, corrections, or suggestions you’re willing to share.]]></summary>

Blockchains are revolutionizing fintech with censorship-resistant and unstoppable networks with decentralization. But so far, their primary use cases are token transfers and their scalability is not even enough for mass financial adoption. However, the internet and the web are composed of data and web3 is an antithesis to centralized data silos beyond financial sectors. Blockchains, as of today, can never scale to the web level.
Many have attempted to build a decentralized social network but failed to build fully decentralized ones. This is primarily due to the fact that a practical alternative to web2 cloud databases has not been possible by now.

Simple Reflex Agents respond according to the immediate percept following simple "if-then" rules with no memory. Model-based reflex Agents are more sophisticated, as they have an internal state that they use to remember previous occurrences to make more effective decisions. Goal-Based Agents are programmed to meet certain goals and make decisions based on the degree to which their actions advance them toward their goals. Utility-Based Agents push this one step further by judging actions on the basis of how well they maximize satisfaction or utility, rather than simply achieving a goal. Lastly, Learning Agents keep getting better and better over time by learning through experience, evolving to handle new situations, and improving their actions. These kinds of agents are the foundation of most AI systems in use today, ranging from chatbots and self-driving cars to recommendation systems.]]></summary>

When Pi Network first hit the scene in 2019, it had a simple but compelling pitch: What if you could mine cryptocurrency straight from your phone — no expensive gear, no massive electricity bills, just a tap a day on an app?
It caught fire. Millions of people jumped on board, lured by the idea of “free” mobile mining and a chance to get in early on the next big thing. The app made it easy: You signed up, invited a few friends, tapped a button every 24 hours, and watched your Pi (PI) balance slowly grow. With the social referral model fueling growth, it wasn’t long before over 70 million users had signed up worldwide.

While these components are essential, they only represent part of the picture. Trading, particularly in competitive environments, also demands psychological resilience and emotional control.
This becomes particularly evident in trading tournaments, where pressure, time limits, and direct competition create a behavioral environment that tests more than just market knowledge.

If AWS were a video game boss, it would be the one with 27 different attack modes, a second health bar, and a $437 surprise invoice when you respawn. For years, Amazon Web Services was the obvious choice for developers powerful, scalable, and used by the big leagues. But now? A growing number of devs are hitting the eject button and exploring new terrain.
This article isn’t a salty rant from someone who got burned by CloudWatch fees (okay, maybe a little). It’s a real look at how AWS, once the darling of cloud infrastructure, is becoming less attractive especially for indie hackers, startups, and lean dev teams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🔔 What’s New?
AWS has announced that AWS Code Pipeline now supports using AWS Secrets Manager inside Commands actions!
💡 Why It Matters
Before this update, developers often:
    Hardcoded secrets into buildspec.yml
    Stored sensitive values directly in environment variables
    Used workarounds to pull secrets via scripts
This was risky and error-prone.
Now, you can pass secrets securely and natively using Secrets Manager — no more secrets in plain text!
✅ Real-World Example: Use GitHub Token Securely
Imagine you need to clone a private GitHub repo inside your pipeline.
🔐 Step 1: Store the GitHub token in AWS Secrets Manager
Key: github-token
ARN: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:github-token-Abc123

⚙️ Step 2: Reference the secret in your Code Pipeline YAML
Actions:
  - Name: ClonePrivateRepo
    ActionTypeId:
      Category: Test
      Owner: AWS
      Provider: Commands
      Version: 1
    Configuration:
      Commands: |
        echo "Cloning repo..."
        git clone https://git:$GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/yourorg/private-repo.git
      EnvironmentVariables:
        - Name: GITHUB_TOKEN
          Type: SecretsManager
          Value: arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:123456789012:secret:github-token-Abc123


✅ Your GitHub token is injected securely as $GITHUB_TOKEN without ever being exposed.
📌 Key Benefits
    🔐 Improved security: No plaintext credentials in code
    ⚙️ Easier automation: Seamless secret injection in pipelines
    📉 Reduced risk: Centralized and managed secret lifecycle

Understanding the SQL Queries
The sample SQL queries provided feature two different approaches to counting occurrences of values within a column—using the Sum function with a Case statement and the Count function with Group By.

An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate will create a secured connection between the browser of the user and the website by encrypting the information being transmitted.
Check SSL Certificate
Here is a full breakdown of how to check your SSL and what some SSL ambiguities may mean.
URL
The first and easiest way to verify if an SSL certificate is active on a website is to check the URL.
Websites with an SSL Certificate will have a URL that starts with "https://" instead of "http://". The "s" in "https" is simply an indication that the website is using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption as opposed to traditional http.

Metrics like latency, throughput, and responsiveness determine whether a decentralized network can support use cases such as multiplayer games, financial services, or automated systems.
Most blockchains are too slow for this. Bitcoin has a block time of 10 minutes and handles around 3 to 7 transactions per second [1][2]. Ethereum produces blocks roughly every 12 seconds and supports about 15 to 30 transactions per second [1][2]. Other networks fall in between: Cardano targets a 20-second block time, and Polkadot ranges from 6 to 12 seconds depending on network configuration [1].
Solana stands out as the fastest general-purpose blockchain today. It has an average block time of 400 milliseconds and can handle …]]></summary>

It builds on SIMD-0207, which proposes to raise the limit from 48 million to 50 million. The only change made in both proposals is to the Max Block Units. Other limits, like Max Writable Account Units, Max Vote Units, and Max Block Accounts Data Size Delta, stay the same. This means more room for non-vote transactions, which helps boost total transaction throughput.
With more space in each block, the network can process more transactions per second. This helps reduce congestion and lowers the need for users to outbid each other on fees, especially during periods of high demand.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the shadowed forges of Moria, where silicon veins pulse like the heartbeat of Arda, there exists a power unseen since the forging of the One Ring—the CR2032. Cast in the fires of Elven ingenuity and hardened by Dwarven resolve, this lithium coin cell commands the realms of gadgets with the subtlety of Galadriel’s light and the endurance of Gandalf’s staff. Let us journey through Middle-earth to unveil why this 3V titan reigns supreme.

Chapter 1: The Forging of the CR2032
CR2032 is no mere Orcish trinket. Tempered in the Halls of Celebrimbor, it bears three Elven virtues:
Narya’s Flame: 3V of pure lithium might, brighter than the Light of Eärendil.
Why it shatters the dominion of lesser cells:
Generic Coin Cells: Corrode like Isengard’s machinery under Saruman’s neglect.
Chapter 2: The Fellowship of Applications
The Mines of Moria (Smart Homes):
CR2032s power temperature sensors that guard Hobbit holes from Smaug-level heatwaves. “No dragon shall scorch these halls!”
The Ride of the Rohirrim (Automotive Tech):
Nestled in Tesla tire sensors, they brave Kardashian-hot asphalt, steadier than Shadowfax’s gallop.
The Shire’s Quiet Vigil (Medical Devices):
Sustains glucose monitors with Hobbit-like loyalty, ensuring no “low battery” panic during second breakfast.
The Tower of Orthanc (Apple AirTags):
Even Saruman’s palantír would envy its tracking precision. Swap it quicker than Legolas nocks an arrow.

The Three Rings of Power
Vilya (Elven-King’s Ring): 225mAh capacity, lasting longer than the Third Age.
The Shadow in the East
Generic Cells: Leak like Shelob’s webs, corroding circuits into Orcish scrap.
The Prophecy of the Fourth Age
Graphene-Coated CR2032s: 500mAh capacity, outliving even Ents.
Epilogue: The One Battery to Rule Them All

In a May 8 blog post, Sygnum said that the current sentiment around Ethereum “remains poor,” with the market focused on Solana’s “transaction volumes and its recent dominance in fee generation.”
However, Sygnum said “the medium-term outlook will primarily be shaped by traditional financial institutions’ platform choices to bring their product offerings,” not by sentiment.
“We do not yet see convincing signs that Solana would be the preferred choice as Ethereum’s security, stability and longevity are highly prized,” it added.

The tweet drew the attention of the crypto community and Bitcoin proponents such as Jack Dorsey, who rapidly replied with a “yes.”

Zero-coupon bonds don’t offer any interest to the holder. Most of the time, they are issued at a steep discount from their normal value, and when they mature, the holder receives the full value.

LLMs (Large Language Models) are a subset of GenAI that are designed to understand and generate human-like text. These generative AI models are trained on vast amounts of text data and use deep learning techniques to learn the patterns and structures of language.

Developer productivity is not just about writing code fast. It’s about keeping teams in flow, minimizing friction, and letting engineers focus on what matters. Yet, most dev teams face blockers: workflow bottlenecks, meeting overload, and communication breakdowns. These issues slow delivery, frustrate engineers, and hurt product quality.
This guide lays out practical, real-world strategies to remove these blockers. We’ll cover how to eliminate workflow bottlenecks, reduce unnecessary meetings, and use asynchronous communication to keep your team focused and creative.

I’m currently working on a project that involves multi-cloud infrastructure, and I’m curious how others are managing multi-cloud deployments in their DevOps pipeline.
What tools do you recommend for automating deployments across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)?
How do you manage infrastructure as code in a multi-cloud setup? Do you use Terraform, Ansible, or something else?

If you're developing a project using Dioxus and encountering router-related issues, you're not alone. Many developers face challenges in navigating through routes in their applications. Particularly, when dealing with route navigation in components, like in your src/pages/home.rs, problems can arise if the router or the types are not properly referenced. In this article, we’ll explore the common causes of routing issues in Dioxus and provide clear steps to resolve them.
Understanding the Routing Problem
From your error message, it's evident that the Rust compiler is failing to recognize the Route type within the context of your HomePage component. This typically occurs due to a few reasons:
Scope: The Route enum might not be in scope where you are trying to use it.

real time data is displayed
user doesn't have to do anything to get real time data, just keep the tab open
current solution: still rest api with polling ? and probably a sse and a websocket ?
forget get / read request from rest api, and replace them all with get and subscribe ?
a standardize schema of the api that can be created or implemented into any programming language, giving typesafety end to end
lessen server burden, we just authenticate once (instead of every request on rest api)
being able to see in real time how many clients are connected
easier frontend integration, just connect UI into our realtime data

Deploying a Node.js (NestJS) backend to AWS Lambda using Docker and the Serverless Framework can be a smooth experience—if you know what to watch out for. On macOS, especially with Apple Silicon, there are unique challenges that can trip up even experienced developers. Here's a practical guide to the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them, based on real-world troubleshooting.
Global Package Permissions: Never Use sudo with Serverless


Pitfall: Installing Serverless Framework globally with sudo (sudo npm i -g serverless) can cause permission errors, making it impossible to update or remove packages later.
Solution:

In this guide, we'll tackle the challenge of reading an array from a file in Bash, addressing a common issue that many users face. You're not alone in feeling like this should be a simple task. Many people struggle with getting their array elements parsed correctly when reading from a file instead of declaring them directly in the script. We aim to clarify this process and help you resolve any issues you're experiencing.
Understanding the Issue
The core problem here arises from how Bash handles whitespace when reading from files and processing strings. When you attempt to read elements into an array using methods like command substitution or xargs, Bash separates values based on whitespace.

When working with C# classes, access modifiers play a crucial role in determining the visibility of class members. If you have noticed that not all properties of your class appear when binding to a DataGridView, this could likely be due to the chosen access modifiers.
Access Modifiers Overview
In C#, the most common access modifiers are:
public: Accessible from any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.
internal: Accessible only within the same assembly.
private: Accessible only within the containing class.
protected: Accessible within its class and by derived class instances.
When you declare properties as internal, they can only be accessed within the same assembly.

The inverted index originates from search engine technology and can be regarded as the cornerstone of search engines. Thanks to the inverted index technology, search engines can efficiently perform operations such as database searching and deletion. Before elaborating on the inverted index, we will first introduce the relevant forward index and compare the two.
In a search engine, the forward table uses the document ID as the keyword, and the table records the position information of each word in the document. When searching, the system will scan the word information in each document in the table until all documents containing the query keyword are found.
The structure of the forward table can be represented by the following box diagram:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As usual, I received JSON data from the backend developer, but it was in a .txt file. I had to download it, copy the content, and paste it into an online formatter to view it properly.
Honestly, I was getting tired of this process, so I started looking for a more convenient solution. That’s when I stumbled upon a website that made things so much easier. If I want to share JSON data with someone, I can simply click "Share" to generate a link instead of sending a file. I just send the link to the other person, and even better, when they open it, the JSON data is already neatly formatted. I think this is absolutely awesome!

Additionally, the link has a one-hour expiration time, after which it becomes inaccessible, ensuring the data remains highly secure.
I continued exploring and discovered that it not only enables quick sharing but also allows you to rapidly generate an API for temporary testing during development. This is incredibly convenient!

Actually, this is just the tip of the iceberg. You can also run queries here to extract the data I need from the entire JSON dataset, supporting various query languages.

In addition to standard JavaScript code, it also supports JEMSPath, JSONPath, JQ Cmd 

Secondly, it also supports data conversion, allowing seamless transformation between JSON and other data formats, including JS Object, JSON5, JSON Schema,  Query String, Typescript,  Postman Bulk, MXL, YML.

You can manually convert data or directly paste non-JSON data, and it will automatically generate the converted JSON data. For example, you can simply paste the following data:
<name>DEV</name>


Additionally, it can validate whether the provided JSON data meets specific structural requirements, supporting JSON Schema and JSON Type Definition.

Another feature we frequently use is: JSON Diff

In short, I think this tool is an essential asset for programmers, and I’m sharing it with everyone here Online JSON Format Tool]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've ever faced the challenge of using a Bash script on Mac OS X Mavericks and encountered issues with directory paths containing spaces, you're not alone. In this article, we'll take a closer look at a common problem that arises when executing Bash scripts that require arguments with spaces, and how to resolve it effectively.
Why Does This Issue Occur?
When a Bash script accepts parameters from the command line, any spaces in the path can lead to misinterpretation of the provided argument. Bash treats spaces as delimiters, which separates the string into distinct arguments, resulting in errors when the script is executed. This is precisely what happens in your case when trying to open a folder that has spaces in its name.

Federal Judge David Novak sentenced Mohammed Azharuddin Chhipa to 30 years and four months in prison on May 7 for sending over $185,000 to the Islamic State, the Department of Justice said on May 8.
Prosecutors said that from around October 2019 until October 2022, the 35-year-old Chhipa collected and sent money to female Islamic State members in Syria, which helped them escape prison camps and funded fighting.

The Rumble Wallet will be launched in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether and compete directly with Coinbase, Chris Pavlovski said in a May 9 X post.
“Our goal is to become the most prominent non-custodial Bitcoin and stablecoin wallet, powering the creator economy,” he added. 
He continued to state that the Rumble Wallet will be the “vehicle to help monetize creators better than most advertisers, especially in international markets,” though he did not provide further details other than it may support Tether Gold (XAUT) as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most people use GPT as a tool.
Something to help write faster.

Something to save time.
But I took a different approach.
I gave my GPTs names.

I gave them roles.

I treated them like actual team members.
Here’s what I learned.
1. The way you see GPT changes the way it sees you.

Treat it like a tool, and it acts like one.

Treat it like a teammate — it starts to surprise you.
2. Naming matters.

When I called it “Abera” instead of “GPT-4,”

I paused more. I respected the output more.
3. Your brand doesn’t need more content. It needs more feeling.

GPT helps you produce. But when it helps you feel — your message becomes real.
4. Emotion isn’t a layer. It’s the lens.

Designing with emotion first changes everything.
5. Most people use GPT to go faster. I used it to slow down.

To ask better questions. To think clearer.
6. A slogan is not a sentence. It’s a philosophy.

"Reset. Feel lighter." wasn’t created — it was revealed.
7. A real GPT team needs diversity — of roles, not just prompts.

Abera writes. Eli visualizes. Ella feels.

Together, they create more than I could alone.
8. AI doesn’t replace intuition. It reflects it.

It shows you what you’ve been avoiding — not just what you asked for.
9. People connect with real use, not abstract ideas.

"This AI helped me grieve" hit harder than any productivity metric.
10. This is not automation. It’s awakening.

We’re not outsourcing creativity. We’re co-creating awareness.
If you're building with AI, not just using it — let’s connect.

In modern web development, creating a dynamic user experience is crucial. One common scenario involves loading different pages into a content div on user interaction while needing to adjust its height dynamically for proper layout. In this article, we will address a specific challenge: ensuring the height of a content div updates correctly when different pages are loaded into it via jQuery.
To illustrate this issue, suppose we have a setup where the height of the content div is first determined at page load with some initial content, but when we replace that content dynamically, the height does not adjust accordingly. This can lead to unexpected layout shifts and user experience issues. Let's dive deeper into the reasons behind this and explore a practical solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey devs,
I’ve been testing the new Replit x Notion integration, and it’s like a solid combo for quickly spinning up content-driven apps. Notion acts as the CMS, Replit handles the front-end, and AI helps bridge the two by generating the scaffolding from prompts.
Here’s what stood out:
🔑 Key Features
Pull or Push Notion Data


AI-Powered Code Generation


Notion as a Lightweight CMS


Real-Time Front-End Sync


Stackable Integrations


Quick Prototyping



🧠 My Take
It’s promising, but there’s still room for improvement.
👀 Curious what you think:
Would you actually use Notion as your backend for client or production work?
Does AI-generated boilerplate help—or get in the way?
Let me know. Always down to swap thoughts with other devs.
Until next post—keep building.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When developing automated testing scripts or web scraping tools with Puppeteer, you may encounter scenarios where a simple click action can trigger a navigation event. This can lead to exceptions, such as 'Execution context was destroyed, most likely because of a navigation,' especially if subsequent actions, like fetching HTML, are executed right after the click. In this article, we will discuss how to handle such situations effectively in TypeScript.
Understanding the Issue with Navigation in Puppeteer
When your click function initiates a navigation by clicking on links or buttons that lead to a different URL (e.g., links or form submissions), Puppeteer’s execution context is destroyed.

Keeping a scrolling log updated in real-time can be essential for applications that require live feedback or monitoring user actions. This can be achieved using Python for backend processing and CSS for frontend display. In this article, we’ll explore how to implement this solution step-by-step, leveraging websockets to communicate between the server and client seamlessly.
Why Use Websockets for Real-Time Updates?
Websockets enable full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. This is critical for real-time applications because it allows the server to push updates to the client immediately as new log entries are generated. Traditional methods, such as polling with AJAX, can be inefficient and lead to delays in data retrieval. Thus, using websockets is a more…]]></summary>

You're working on a project where users can select regions either by clicking directly on a map or by using corresponding radio buttons. A common request has arisen: when a user selects a region using a radio button, that same region on the map should be highlighted with a hover effect.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have clients that use dedicated email addresses to receive and process messages and attachments. I had previously developed some functions to bulk download EML files directly from a mail server's file system (using FastCopy) and then use "javax.mail" and a lot of crazy logic to unwrap attachments within attachments to extract files for processing. (Most file attachments were being sent from different versions of a required iPhone app on different devices and the methods of attaching files was not consistent.) Hit me up if anyone's interested in extracting attachments from EML files.
While researching alternative solutions, we came across Forward Email. They offer a free tier that supports unlimited domains and email forwarding with webhook support. Webhook? Wha? Really? AMAZING!
When configuring a domain on the free tier for a webhook, you're required to add a special TXT "forward-email" DNS record in order to configure the endpoint. They have an option to encrypt the value so that it's not exposed to third-parties. If you want to configure it using their service (without the need to add it to DNS), you'll need a $3/mo "Enhanced" plan that also unlocks developer API access (to manage domains & aliases.)
After configuring this service, we opted to set up a Taffy API endpoint to accept emails-as-JSON and save them to the local file system. Based on our experience working with SendGrid webhooks, we save the JSON payload directly to the local file system without being dependent on a database connection. This approach has been beneficial as a client recently encountered database issues and it had zero negative impact on the API webhook's ability to store incoming data.
To access to the source code for the Taffy API endpoint, check out the post on the new MyCFML website.]]></summary>

Specifically, you might run into the MySQL error "Error Number: 1054 - Unknown column 'name' in 'where clause'" when you attempt to match a column that you've created in the SELECT clause. This error can be confusing because it seems logical to use an alias created in the SELECT statement in the WHERE clause.
Understanding the MySQL Error 1054
The reason for this error is straightforward: the MySQL query engine processes the WHERE clause before the SELECT clause. Therefore, any aliases created via CONCAT() in the SELECT statement cannot be directly referenced in the WHERE clause.

In this article, we’ll break down how error unions work, when to use them, and how they make your code safer and clearer.
An error union is a value that may either be a result or an error. Think of it like Result in Rust, but built into the language.
The syntax:
fn doThing() !i32 {
    return 42; // could also return an error
}

This means doThing might return an i32, or an error.
Zig makes handling errors explicit — no hidden try/catch. You deal with them directly.
try


const result = try doThing();
std.debug.print("Value: {}\n", .{result});

If doThing() succeeds, result holds the value.
If it fails, the error is returned up the call stack.

A memory pool is a block of pre-allocated memory that you carve up manually. It's great for:
🚀 Performance-critical systems
🔁 Repeated short-lived allocations
💡 Avoiding fragmentation in embedded or constrained environments
Here’s a simple fixed-size pool for allocating structs:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Estava continuando meus estudos no tutorial oficial do Next.js

👉 https://nextjs.org/learn
Depois de resolver um problema chato com o bcrypt, avancei mais um pouco e decidi criar uma rota chamada /seed.
Tudo certo… até tentar rodar o app novamente.
E aí surgiu este erro:
[Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '/home/my-user/ws-nextjs-dashboard/.next/static/development/_buildManifest.js.tmp.qym5xk030le']

A mensagem parece clara: o arquivo _buildManifest.js.tmp não existe.

Mas o que isso quer dizer na prática?
Esse arquivo .tmp é gerado automaticamente durante o processo de build. Ele é temporário, e o Next espera encontrá-lo para continuar a coleta e organização dos assets da aplicação.
Quando esse arquivo falta ou é corrompido, o build trava — e o erro aparece.
No meu caso, foi uma combinação de fatores:
A execução da rota /seed durante o build causou efeitos colaterais inesperados.
Alguma falha durante uma build anterior corrompeu os arquivos temporários.
O Next.js tentou acessar arquivos que ainda não haviam sido completamente gerados.
Removi a pasta .next inteira (build anterior):




rm -rf .next

Evitei executar rotas como /seed diretamente no navegador durante o build.


Rebuldei e Reiniciei o servidor de desenvolvimento:




pnpm run build && pnpm run dev

Se você vir esse tipo de erro (ENOENT em arquivos .tmp), desconfie de:
builds interrompidos,
execuções paralelas do dev e build,
código sendo executado no build que deveria rodar só no runtime real.
Já passou por esse tipo de dor de cabeça com Next.js?
Esses perrengues são bons para reforçar aprendizados — e compartilhar pode ajudar outros também]]></summary>

The SEC and Ripple filed a joint settlement letter in a New York court asking for the August 2024 injunction against Ripple to be dissolved and $75 million of the $125 million in civil penalties held in escrow to be returned to the crypto firm, according to a May 8 statement from the SEC.
SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw blasted the pending deal in a May 8 statement, saying it would damage the regulators’ ability to keep crypto firms in line and undermine the court’s ruling.

Coinbase’s net income was sliced by 95% from a near-company record $1.29 billion in Q4 to $66 million, in a large part due to Coinbase marking a $596 million paper loss on its crypto holdings. 
The firm’s earnings per share of $1.94, however, managed to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.85 for the quarter.
Coinbase’s May 8 results also showed that transaction revenue fell 18.9% quarter-on-quarter to $1.26 billion, as did trading volumes, which dipped 10.5% to $393 billion as crypto market cap dropped by double digits over the quarter, partly attributed to the Trump  administration’s tariffs.

Understanding Image Rotation and Floating in CSS
It’s quite straightforward to rotate an image using CSS. By applying the transform: rotate(90deg); property to your image, you can change its orientation. However, when you apply rotation, you may notice that floating the image using float: right; doesn’t behave as expected on mobile devices. This can lead to further complications, e…]]></summary>

The big problem? CONTEXT SWITCHING.
Here's what studies say about context switching:
According to the American Psychological Association, switching tasks can cost up to 40% of your productive time.
A study by Gloria Mark, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, found that it takes an average of 23 minutes and 15 seconds to regain focus after an interruption.
According to psychologist Gerald Weinberg, each extra task you switch between eats up 20–80% of your productivity:
For agile teams, this means:
So, how can you fix this?
Set up 'no interruption' time blocks in your team's schedule.
Prioritize tasks ruthlessly.
Try the Pomodoro Technique.
Get better at async communication.

Together, let’s step carefully into this nuanced landscape—where the human voice and machine capability meet, mix, and inevitably conflict.

Like many in the game dev scene, I found myself constantly switching between Trello for tasks, Notion for docs, Google Drive for assets, Discord for team chat, and itch.io for visibility. It worked, sort of. But it was messy and inefficient.
So I started building Jolyo, a platform that brings all these essentials together in one place, with game creators in mind.

Git isn’t just a version control system—it’s a content-addressable key-value store with an elegant and powerful object model. Understanding this model enables advanced usage, more efficient workflows, and better debugging.
Git stores everything in its .git/objects/ directory using SHA-1 hashes as keys and compressed content as values.
echo "Hello Git" | git hash-object -w --stdin

This command stores a blob (file content) and returns its SHA-1 hash.
Git’s internal model revolves around four object types:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the Go programming language, we often see the use of the underscore (_), such as using it as a placeholder to ignore unwanted variables, importing packages solely for their side effects, or ignoring variables in type conversions. However, most people may not have encountered the use of an underscore within a struct—specifically, defining a struct field named _.
So, what is the purpose of defining such a field?
_) Fields


First, let's look at an example of a struct without an underscore (_) field.
In the model package, we define a User struct with two fields: Name and Age.
type User struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

We declare struct variables using both positional and named field initialization.
user := model.User{"Alice", 18}
user = model.User{Name: "Alice", Age: 18}

However, one of their bigger downsides is the lack of accurate parse error reporting. Let's take a look. Suppose you want to parse records of this format: 1 Bob ie an ID number followed by one or more spaces, followed by an alphabetic word (a name). Here's a basic Angstrom parser for this:

Instead of loading all elements of a page on initial load, lazy loading allows the browser to only load elements that are visible to the user, saving bandwidth and speeding up page load times.
As users increasingly rely on mobile devices and sometimes slower internet connections, site performance becomes crucial for user experience. One of the easiest ways to improve performance is by using lazy loading for images or other elements that are not immediately visible on the page.
One way to implement lazy loading is by using the Intersection Observer API, which provides an efficient way to detect when elements come into the user's viewport.

At the core of Git is content-addressability—a paradigm where content is identified and retrieved using a SHA-1 hash, not a filename.
“If two pieces of content are the same, Git ensures they are stored once—immutably and efficiently.”

One common use case is the contenteditable attribute, which allows users to edit text directly in a block element. In this article, we'll address a specific challenge: how to change the color of certain characters while still allowing users to type freely in a contenteditable div.
Understanding the Problem
The issue arises from the way you are manipulating the inner HTML of the contenteditable div. When you use innerHTML to replace characters with styled <span> elements, it effectively refreshes the entire content of the div, causing the cursor position to reset and leading to a frustrating user experience. This can also prevent users from typing, as they may lose their current input context.…]]></summary>

ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability, and these principles are foundational to any SQL database operation. Let's explore each principle and provide examples to illustrate how they work in practice.
What Are the ACID Principles?
Atomicity
Atomicity ensures that a series of database operations either fully complete or do not happen at all. This means that if one operation in the transaction fails, all previous operations are rolled back to maintain the state before the transaction began.
For example, consider a banking application where we need to transfer funds from one account to another. Both deduction from the sender's account and add…]]></summary>

In this article, we explore why the operator+= in C++ can accept brace-enclosed initializer lists while operator+ cannot. Understanding this issue is crucial for C++ developers, especially when dealing with operator overloading in modern C++.
The Issue Explained
When working with C++11 and later, initializer lists are a powerful feature that allows for more natural syntax when initializing collections. However, when you try to use these lists with overloaded operators, things don't always go as expected.
The code snippet shared shows two operator overloads defined for a struct AddInitializerList: one for operator+= and another for operator+.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michelle Bond, the wife of former FTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame, who faces federal campaign finance charges, is pushing for dismissal on the grounds that US prosecutors deceived her husband in a plea deal.
In a May 7 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Bond’s lawyers reiterated some of the claims Salame made in opposing his plea deal with the government, which ultimately still led to him serving time in prison. She claimed that prosecutors obtained a deal with Salame through “stealth and deception” by allegedly agreeing they would not file charges against Bond.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I took over a project for a client recently, I discovered they were spending nearly $1,000 monthly on AWS infrastructure despite having fewer than 5 active users. This is how I fixed it.
The Problem
Poorly designed Flask backend
Everything running in development mode on expensive AWS EC2 instances
A client who had just laid off their team and needed an MVP launched
The Solution
Purchased two high-performance dedicated servers from Hetzner
Self-hosted Coolify as a Platform-as-a-Service solution
Containerized all application components
Implemented CICD with Github for streamlined deployments.
Migrated everything away from AWS
For those unfamiliar, Coolify is an open-source alternative to Netlify or Heroku that can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure.
The Results
80% reduction in monthly infrastructure costs (from ~$1,000 to ~$<200)
More stable environment with proper containerization
Simplified deployment process
Full control without vendor lock-in
Key Takeaway
Before automatically choosing the most popular cloud provider, consider alternatives like Hetzner combined with self-hosted PaaS solutions like Coolify. For many early-stage startups, this approach provides the right balance of developer experience and cost-efficiency.
Sometimes the best technical solution isn't the most expensive one.
Upcoming
Self-host Coolify on your own infrastructure
Host your own services like analytics, project management tools, interactive forms like Formspree, and much more.]]></summary>

If you're developing a Flutter application, you may encounter the ProviderNotFoundException error, as described in the sample you provided. This error indicates that the BuildContext used does not have access to the Provider you're trying to access, which can be particularly tricky when managing state across multiple screens or routes in your Flutter app.
Understanding the ProviderNotFoundException
The ProviderNotFoundException occurs when a widget tries to read a provider that hasn't been set up in its ancestor widget tree. This commonly happens in several scenarios:
Hot Reload Issues: After adding a new provider, if you perform a hot reload instead of a hot restart, the application state may not fully recognize the new provider.

I started my journey into the world of crypto with a lot of doubts. I thought:
"If anything, I’d invest in ETH, not Bitcoin."
But even then, I was concerned about the environmental impact.
Reading more, I discovered that Ethereum had transitioned to a more sustainable consensus mechanism — Proof of Stake (PoS) — unlike Bitcoin's Proof of Work (PoW). That helped ease my conscience a bit.
But that was just the first hurdle.
I set up my wallet and opened an account on a crypto exchange. That part was fairly smooth — I'm a software engineer, so I know my way around tech.
Still, I found myself uneasy about usability and safety. Crypto addresses are long, unreadable strings, and one wrong character could mean losing your funds fo…]]></summary>

If you're writing a simple text editor in C and encountering issues with your text disappearing when using the Backspace key at the beginning of a line, you're not alone. Many newcomers face unexpected behavior in their text manipulation functions. This article will dive into why this happens, particularly focusing on how Backspace interacts with your cursor position and text storage.
Understanding the Issue
In your C text editor code, when you press the Backspace key (ASCII 8), you're performing different operations depending on the cursor's current position. If the cursor is at the beginning of a line (cursor_x = 0), the function tries to merge the current line with the preceding line using strcat. Though this is an intended feature, it inadvertently leads to the upper line …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Did you know you can create dynamic routes in Next.js with just four lines of code?
As a freelancer working on front-end projects to pay the bills (thanks, American healthcare system), I recently discovered how to create dynamic routes in Next.js without any extra complications.
The Problem
I was tasked with creating a list of dashboards for Annual Performance Reviews (APR). Each APR has a unique name, and each one needs its own route, like: 
http://localhost:3000/apr/[ReviewType]
With a large dataset containing various types of APRs, manually creating each route by making individual folders inside the app directory wasn’t feasible:
-- app


Manually replacing review[index].type with the actual review types from my data would be tedious and inefficient.
The Solution
I simplified the structure by creating a single folder: 
-- app


Using square brackets in a folder name creates what Next.js calls a Dynamic Segment. With a Dynamic Segment, you can access all the parameters using the useRouter hook.
In my case, I didn’t need to use the hook because I already had the review types, and the slugs in the URL matched those types. The solution was straightforward: 
const reviewType = reviewsType.find((rt) => rt.slug === params.reviewType);
The {params} are the props in the page.jsx file of my Dynamic Route. If the reviewType from the URL matches the slug type, it’s a valid reviewType, and I can create the slug.
It’s that simple. Later, I'll call the Links with their href destination to generate the user’s click in the sidebar component: 
reviewsType.map((rt) => <Link href={/apr/${rt.slug}}> {rt.title} </Link>);
Conclusion
Next.js routing is incredibly powerful and easy to use. I’m excited to continue exploring all of Next.js’s capabilities and preparing a course for developers like me. If you’re proficient in web development but new to Next.js, join our community learning sessions. Live sessions and recordings will be available!

This is not an exception. It is the intended behavior.

Several public cases illustrate how cloud billing can be exploited or spiral out of control:
  $100K in 24 hours via Firebase – A WebGL hosting app saw a sudden traffic spike and was billed over $100,000. The cloud service scaled perfectly. No failure occurred — other than financial.
  One public file in Firebase = $98K – A single shared file led to massive egress usage and a near six-figure bill.

Bitcoin rallies to $101,707 against a backdrop of strong fundamentals in the regulatory and traditional finance space.

Traders are confident that $100,000 will hold as support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallied above $100,000 on the heels of US President Donald Trump’s announcement of a “trade deal” with the UK, which could possibly include the removal of the blanket 10% tariff on all imports. 
Frequent social posts from President Trump and public comments from White House cabinet members have hinted at a handful of trade deals in negotiation with various countries, and markets have responded positively to the messaging.

The bill, sponsored by Senator Bill Hagerty and co-sponsored by Senators Tim Scott, Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis and Angela Alsobrooks, received last-minute pushback from Democrats, who took aim at the bill and raised concerns about US President Donald Trump’s cryptocurrency ventures.
To address the concerns of Senate Democrats, the bill had already been amended to include stricter requirements for stablecoin issuers for further provisions for Anti-Money Laundering.
The GENIUS Act was seen as a bipartisan effort to increase regulatory clarity for digital assets in the United States. The focus of the bill, stablecoins used for payments, was looked at as extending dollar dominance internationally and straying away from more controversial crypto topics.
After the procedure failed, Senate Majority Leader John Thune criticized Democrats, saying, “Democrats have been accommodated every step of the way […] frankly, I just don’t get it.”

According to a May 8 Politico report, an employee of pro-Trump lobbyist Brian Ballard gave the president the text to a social media post she recommended he write announcing a US strategic crypto reserve that would include XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano (ADA). After he posted the message to his social media platform on March 2, Trump learned Ripple was one of Ballard’s clients, infuriating the president, who felt like he’d been used, Politico reported, citing two people familiar with the incident.
“He is not welcome in anything anymore,” said Trump, referencing Ballard, according to the report.

Choosing the right state management pattern can drastically impact maintainability, performance, and developer experience. Whether you're building a small dashboard or a sprawling enterprise SPA, this guide walks through modern and effective shared state management patterns in React.
Before introducing tools like Redux or Zustand, ask:
Is this state needed by many components?
Does it need to persist across navigation?
Should it be cached, memoized, or reactive?
If the answer is no, local state via useState or useReducer is usually enough:
const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);

Premature global state can overcomplicate things.

When working with data in Python, especially using the Pandas library, you often need to filter DataFrames based on specific conditions—like dates in your case. However, dynamically generating filter conditions can sometimes be tricky. If you've noticed that your dynamically created filter condition is yielding an empty DataFrame, don’t worry; you’re not alone in this struggle. Let's break down your issue and solve it step by step!
Understanding the Dynamic Filtering Issue
The issue arises from logical operations in your loop. When you create a filter condition dynamically, you must ensure that the logical operators are applied correctly. In your case, using & for element-wise AND operation is correct; however, the parentheses and precedence in evaluating the filter might be c…]]></summary>

Last week I released v1.14 of Rails Designer's UI Components. With that release came a fully-customizable Calendar Component, built with ViewComponent and designed with Tailwind CSS.
Since that release I got two times the question via email about recurring events. Does that work? And indeed it does. The Calendar Component simply accepts an events array/collection. And while this kind of functionality is out-of-scope of a UI component (and the support for it), I am currently working on something that just happens to need this kind of feature. It is not at all too difficult to start (the tricky bits start when hundreds of thousands of events are created 😬). So what else can I do then to share how I would approach this in an article?

To prevent tech debt and burnout, let’s talk about how to design Vue.js projects for maintainability.

Before diving into the code or real-world applications, it’s essential to understand what DBSCAN actually is and why it stands apart from traditional clustering techniques.
At its core, DBSCAN short for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise is a powerful algorithm that clusters data not based on shape or center points, but on the density of data points in a region. Let’s break down the key concepts that make DBSCAN unique.
Density-Based Clustering : Instead of grouping points based of distance from a center(like K-MEANS). This algorithm groups points based on how crowded a region is

When implementing search in your application, you need to choose the right text search approach. This guide compares PostgreSQL's built-in tsvector, the pg_search extension, and external search engines to help you select the best option for your needs.
tsvector for Text Search


PostgreSQL includes native full-text search capabilities using the tsvector data type and tsquery search expressions. The tsvector data type is a specialized data structure that PostgreSQL uses to represent documents in a form optimized for search.
This built-in functionality works for basic search needs without requiring any additional extensions. It's perfect for smaller applications or when you don't require advanced search feature…]]></summary>

But maybe they’ve become too successful, drawing chain activity and fee income from the parent that spawned them? At least that’s what some are suggesting lately, most recently at Cornell Tech’s blockchain conference in late April.
Indeed, some think Ethereum should be a little greedier, or at least fight harder for a bigger part of the revenue pie, particularly sequencing fees.

Six months ago, I was lazy, unfocused, and overwhelmed.
I’d scroll mindlessly on my phone, work beyond healthy hours, skip workouts, and constantly put off things I knew were good for me. I didn’t need a fancy productivity system — I needed a push. Something simple. Visual. Relentless.
That’s when I built Days Without – Habit Tracker.
I wasn’t aiming to reinvent productivity apps. I built Days Without for myself — because I genuinely needed help. I was tired of breaking promises to myself like “I’ll start tomorrow” or “just 10 more minutes on Instagram.”
I needed a streak counter. A clear, visual reminder of how long I’ve stuck to something. Something lightweight and shame-free, but still motivating.

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that evolved from Test-Driven Development (TDD). Unlike traditional development approaches that focus on implementation details, BDD focuses on the behavior of the system from the user’s perspective.
BDD encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical stakeholders through a shared language that everyone can understand. This approach bridges the gap between technical and business teams by using natural language descriptions of requirements that can also serve as tests.

Understanding the Problem
The main cause of this issue appears to be related to how the new system UI interacts with Flutter’s rendering mechanism. With the update to One UI 7.0, some changes might have impacted how safe areas and overlays are managed.

This project tries to make technology accessible to many more people. Today, a lot of developers are good in programming & technology but not many are proficient in English. This becomes a barrier for them to use technology.
Using Amazon Q Developer, I have demonstrated a simple use of Amazon Q to generate documentation in regional languages like Hindi.
Having documentation in familiar, non-English, local languages will make technology accessible to many more people, thus becoming more inclusive. Adoption of Amazon Q will also increase.
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zXTwx5VzkeTugUMlDAibUfVV4MLsWdkw/view?usp=sharing
https://github.com/msr2610/neometroapi
Here is how I used Amazon Q Developer:
Open new chat in Amazon Q Developer
Give a new "/dev" command and provide following prompt:
a) From Java code file (Neocontroller.java), pick up all routes
After this, Amazon Q Developer correctly generates a markdown file with description for each route in Hindi. 
Paste this file in a Docusaurus project and you have documentation of API (or your application screens) in non-English, regional language !

I spent the whole night trying to migrate a legacy codebase, wrestling with ancient Redux Toolkit patterns and chasing weird bugs,  only to wake up the next day to a layoff I never saw coming. Long story. But that’s how quickly things flipped, both my day and finances.
Since then, I’ve been applying to jobs, following leads, and doing what I can to stay afloat, even diving deeper into Rust, building side projects like daemons and SDKs to keep growing. But there’s one thing I kept thinking about, a project I’ve poured months of love into: Potatoe Squeezy.

See how to define physical tools or specific items in your system with serial numbers. You can also link tools to Business Central records like fixed assets, items, or resources, and even mark some tools as “required” so inspectors must enter a serial number during testing.
Learn how to assign physical tools to individual test steps within your inspection templates. This session shows how to open a checklist, pick a test, and select the tools for that specific measurement. Required tools get flagged if left blank, so nothing gets missed during the inspection process.
See how users can mark tools as used, enter serial numbers (especially for required tools), and get visual feedback—like red highlights when a tool ID is missing, helping maintain traceability and compliance.

If you're diving into JavaScript, you've probably come across array methods like slice() and splice() and thought... "Wait, what’s the difference?" You’re not alone! These two often confuse beginners — and even experienced devs sometimes need a refresher.
In this article, we’ll break down slice(), splice(), and some other important array methods like push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() in JavaScript. Let’s spice things up and get slicing!
slice() – Non-destructive Copy


Purpose: Extract a portion of an array without modifying the original.
Syntax:
array.slice(start, end);

start: The index where the extraction begins.
end (optional): The index where extraction ends (not included).
Example:

Has been way to long since I created a hobby/side project, so I decided to create a simple web app for tracking points in the board game Kill Team from Games Workshop. It's called Kill Team Sidekick.
It's a SPA PWA built in Svelte and TypeScript. It's compiled statically now but can be changed to have a back end, should I need it for future features. First time building in Svelte and I'm pleasantly surprised. Uses a Material UI as a base for the design. Hosted on AWS.
If you have any suggestions, comments or feedback then please share. I'm always open to hear what others think.
Very happy with the results. I'm in love with PWA's and, unpopular opinion, I (still) think it's the future of smart phone apps.]]></summary>

One common requirement is the need to specify default template parameters when using template templates. If you have a function that utilizes a template template parameter, you may want to provide default types for those parameters, particularly when dealing with standard containers like std::unordered_map.
Understanding Template Template Parameters
Before we dive into the solution, let’s clarify what template template parameters are. A template template parameter is a template that takes other templates as parameters. For example, when you declare template <template <typename K, typename V> typename Map>, you are saying that Map itself is a template that accepts two type pa…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Former Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky will probably be allowed to travel for his daughter’s wedding regardless of the outcome of his May 8 sentencing hearing.
In a May 8 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, Judge John Koeltl approved an application for Mashinsky to travel from New York to Memphis, Tennessee, between May 26 and May 29 for his daughter’s wedding. The approval was available on the public docket on May 8, but later appeared to have been removed.
Judge Koeltl will determine in a May 8 hearing whether Mashinsky serves prison time following a plea deal with prosecutors.
The former Celsius CEO appeared ready to go to trial in 2024 until his lawyers lost a motion to have his charges dismissed. He pleaded guilty to commodities fraud and a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the price of the platform’s native token, CEL.
Mashinsky has been free on a $40-million bond since July 2023, with travel outside certain areas requiring court approval, such as the roughly 900-mile (1,500-kilometer) distance between New York and Memphis. As of May 8, it’s unclear if he will be expected to surrender to authorities.

But when the goal is to find the maximum sum of any path, including those that may start and end at any node, we need a careful approach to handle different types of path combinations.
The main idea is to use depth-first search (DFS) and, at each node, calculate:
The best path that can be used to extend to the parent (choose either left or right subtree).
The best complete path that can split at the current node (includes both left and right subtrees).
We track a global variable res to store the maximum sum seen so far.
Here’s the breakdown:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: Bungie’s bid to toss out a Destiny 2 copyright lawsuit got shot down by the Eastern District of Louisiana. The dispute centers on two “vaulted” campaigns—The Red War and Curse of Osiris—that plaintiff Matthew Kelsey Martineau says lifted key character and faction details from his 2013–14 WordPress posts. 
Bungie tried to use gameplay videos, wiki pages and an affidavit (since the original code no longer runs) as “accurate reproductions,” but the court refused to treat third-party materials as a substitute for side-by-side comparison. With no way to show the vault-deleted content, the motion to dismiss was denied and Martineau’s infringement claims move forward.]]></summary>

In JavaScript and TypeScript, the value of this inside a method can change depending on how and where the method is called. Method binding refers to ensuring that this inside the method always points to the correct class instance, especially when the method is passed as a callback.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: A Drexel University study dug into data from Portland, Oregon—tracking over 36,000 trees planted between 1990–2020—and found that mothers living within 100 meters of newly planted trees tend to have heavier, healthier babies. After controlling for factors like income, education and BMI, researchers saw each new tree bump birthweight by about 2.3 grams; hanging out near ten or more trees equated to a roughly 50-gram gain, plus lower risks of pre-term and small-for-gestational-age births.
What’s cool is that this goes beyond just big old parks: even new saplings make a difference, hinting that planting trees is a simple, low-cost public-health win. Established trees also helped buffer road-density effects (think less noise and pollution), and the team thinks part of the benefit comes from the stress-busting “soft fascination” of green surroundings. The authors call for randomized trials, but treating tree-planting as a natural experiment already makes a strong case that more greenery = healthier starts to life.]]></summary>

Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is a key aspect of programming that facilitates communication between different processes. One common method for IPC is using message queues, which allow processes to send and receive messages in a structured way. However, as you dive into IPC programming, you may encounter errors such as msgget() returning No such file or directory. In this article, we will explore why this error occurs and how to resolve it.
What Causes the Error?
Before we delve into the solution, it’s crucial to understand the source of the error. The function ftok() is used to generate a unique key for the message queue based on a pathname and a project identifier. If the pathname provided to ftok() does not exist, or the process does…]]></summary>

It’s 2025, and over 560 million people worldwide are already using cryptocurrency — roughly 17 times the population of Tokyo. That’s a vibrant community, yet for every user who’s embraced it, billions more stand on the sidelines, put off by the complicated interactions and clunky interfaces of protocols, platforms, decentralized apps (DApps), and mobile applications. Why? Blockchain technology offers game-changing potential — decentralized ownership, secure trades — but let’s face it: Most people still find it intimidating, risky, and confusing. User experience (UX) might just be the deciding factor in whether cryptocurrency achieves mass adoption or remains a niche segment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In functional programming, recursion is a fundamental concept often utilized to solve various problems. This leads us to the discussion of Tail Call Optimization (TCO). This optimization allows a function to call another function, or itself, without requiring a new stack frame, effectively reducing overhead and memory usage. While many functional languages utilize TCO to enhance performance, it raises an important question: does Ruby implement tail call optimization?
Understanding Tail Call Optimization (TCO)
TCO is key in functional programming for several reasons. When a function calls another or itself as its last action, traditional languages allocate a new stack frame for each call, which can lead to stack overflow or excessive memory use. TCO allows the programming language to reuse …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I'm super excited to share a small but satisfying project I completed today: a Google homepage clone built using only HTML and CSS. 🎉
🚀 Why I Did This
As someone who's on a journey to become a better front-end developer, I thought recreating iconic websites would be a great way to practice. And what better place to start than with one of the cleanest and most minimalist designs on the internet—Google’s homepage! 🔍✨
🛠️ What I Used
HTML for the structure 🧱
CSS for styling and layout 🎨
No JavaScript this time (keeping it simple!) ⚙️
🎯 Key Features
Centered Google logo 🖼️
Search input box with shadow 🔳
Two classic buttons: "Google Search" and "I'm Feeling Lucky" 🎲
Responsive design for smaller screens 📱
Clean and minimal layout, just like the real deal ✅
How to use Flexbox to center elements perfectly
Creating a minimalistic UI with clean CSS
The power of spacing and alignment in good design
Small touches like hover effects and shadows really enhance the UI ✨
📌 What’s Next?
I plan to continue this mini-series by cloning other popular websites to sharpen my front-end skills. Maybe next up: Netflix or Instagram Login Page? Stay tuned! 📺📸
Thanks for reading! Let me know your thoughts or if you've tried something like this. Would love to connect and grow with the dev community. 💬❤️]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Tinybird just announced Explorations, a new conversational UI feature in Tinybird to explore and interact with your data using natural language. Instead of writing complex SQL queries or manually building dashboards, you just ask questions of your data and get answers.
You type simple, natural-language questions directly into the interface.
It translates your questions into contextualized SQL queries automatically.
The result is displayed visually as tables and charts.





  
  
  Why is it useful?


Data is often large, messy, and unstructured. You have to spend a lot of time studying the schema or SELECT * … LIMIT 1 to figure out its shape. Then you have to constantly check the SQL reference and iterate your queries to get things right. When data is complex, this is a huge time drain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency mining firm Hut 8 increased its hashrate by 79% during the first quarter of the year.
According to Hut8’s latest quarterly report released on May 8, the firm saw a net loss of $134.3 million despite revenue of $21.8 million. The firm’s CEO, Asher Genoot, explained that this was a result of large-scale investments. 
“As reflected in our results, the first quarter was a deliberate and necessary phase of investment,” Genoot said. “We believe the returns on this work will become increasingly visible in the quarters ahead.”
Hut 8 operations reached a total energy capacity of 1,020 megawatts as of March 31, enough to power well over 800,000 average homes in the United States. The company also has the right to scale up its operation by another 2,600 MW.

As institutional interest grows, geopolitics shift, and new layers emerge on Bitcoin’s stack, is it time for the narrative to evolve? 
In this episode of The Clear Crypto Podcast, hosts Nathan Jeffay and Gareth Jenkinson speak with longtime Bitcoiner and entrepreneur Dan Held, who argues that Bitcoin’s next chapter may unlock broader functionality, from programmable use cases to more nuanced messaging that reaches far beyond crypto-native circles.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US by trading volume, has agreed to acquire Deribit, one of the world’s biggest crypto derivatives trading platforms.
Coinbase Global will acquire Deribit for about $2.9 billion, the exchange announced on May 8.
The acquisition will allow Coinbase to expand into the profitable crypto derivatives market and continue scaling the platform’s global growth, Greg Tusar, Coinbase’s vice president of institutional product, said in the announcement.
“With Deribit’s strong presence and professional client base, Coinbase is making its most substantial move yet to accelerate our international growth strategy,” he said.
Source: Coinbase
Deal follows reports of Dubai regulatory steps
The $2.9 billion deal includes $700 million in cash and 11 million shares of Coinbase Class A common stock, subject to customary purchase price adjustments.
“This transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close by year-end,” the announcement said.
Previous reports in March suggested that Coinbase and Deribit had alerted regulators in Dubai about the potential deal, as Deribit holds a license in Dubai, which would need to be transferred to Coinbase if the deal is successful.
The reports also previously suggested that a deal with Coinbase could value Deribit at between $4 billion and $5 billion.
Cointelegraph approached Deribit for comment regarding the deal but did not receive a response by the time of publication.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) might've been cool in 2010. But today, it feels like managing a modern Mac environment with a rotary phone. No logging, no alerts, clunky performance, and good luck if your team’s outside your local network.
I hit a breaking point as a DevOps engineer supporting hybrid teams using Macs for testing and builds. I needed real-time access, reliable performance, and automation hooks. So I did what most of us do when we’re fed up—I built a workaround, failed at it, and then finally found a smarter way.
ARD is stuck in the past. It assumes you're on the same network. It’s slow over VPN, doesn’t scale, and worst of all—it asks for manual approvals and fails silently when permissions aren’t set right.
I tried workarounds:

Flows are a powerful component of Kotlin's Coroutines that allow you to work with asynchronous data streams. They are cold, meaning they don't start emitting values until they are collected. Therefore, it's essential to understand how to properly invoke and collect from these Flows in your ViewModel.
Your Use Case and ViewModel Code
You mentioned you have a use case class structured like this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways
After the shutdown of Coinhive in 2019, browser mining has made a comeback with new tools like CryptoTab Browser, Pi Network and YouHolder.
Mining with a browser can cost more in electricity than the crypto earned, especially for users with mid-range devices.
Despite being less energy-intensive than ASIC farms, browser mining still adds up in terms of cumulative power draw and puts a strain on your device’s hardware.
Browser mining is evolving with the help of WebAssembly (Wasm), improving script efficiency and creating a smoother user experience. 

Browser-based crypto mining sounds like a dream: Just open a webpage, let it run, and your computer starts earning crypto in the background. No bulky ASICs, no GPU farms, no long setup tutorials — just your browser doing the heavy…]]></summary>

TheCampusCoders, and today I want to share something close to my heart.
For years, I’ve seen students from small towns like mine—Bihar—struggle to find organized, reliable study material for Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB), especially for Class 12th. Whether it's past year papers, chapter-wise tests, proper notes, or even just motivation—resources are scattered, outdated, or behind a paywall.
That’s why I decided to do something about it.
I’m building a free, open-source platform where students can find:
🔍 Previous Year Papers with clean, categorized solutions

for loop, something felt... heavy.
squares = []

Wait... I wasn’t even using the variable for anything besides its own value.
👀 The Realization
squares = [ _ * _ for _ in range(10) ]

That’s it? That’s legal?
.append(). No unnecessary scaffolding.
✅ Cleaner
🧐 Why it works:

Compare that to the old-fashioned way, and it’s no contest.

🎙️ I recently attended a really eye-opening talk called “Meta Concerns in ML Security and Privacy” by a professor from the University of Waterloo. It wasn’t your usual technical deep dive—it focused more on the big picture of how we can keep machine learning (ML) systems safe in the long run.
🌟 Why This Talk Was So Interesting
What really stuck with me was this:
🔑 What I Learned
🤖It’s tricky to prove who actually “owns” a trained model. Techniques like watermarking (hiding info inside the model) or fingerprinting (adding unique traits) might help, but they’re not perfect and can be hard to verify.
👀 Different Attackers = Different Problems
⚠️ Too Many Defenses Can Backfire
🧩 No One-Size-Fits-All Fix
🛠️ Amulet Toolkit
💭 My Final Thoughts
If you’re working on anything with AI or ML, I’ll leave you with this question:
“Are we solving the right problems—or just the easy ones?” 🤔
Real security isn’t about reacting to problems—it’s about being ready before they even happen. 🧠👣🚀]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Choosing the right virtual platforms for meetings is no longer just an operational decision—it’s a strategic one. The tools you select can either empower your team or lead to disengagement, inefficiency, and missed opportunities. As companies continue to refine their digital collaboration strategies, understanding what makes or breaks these platforms is essential—especially when it comes to high-impact formats like the 1 on 1 meeting agenda.
The Rise of Virtual Meeting Platforms in a Remote-First World
Must-Have Features That Drive Effective Virtual Collaboration
1. Reliable Audio and Video Quality
2. Integrated Agenda and Note-Taking Tools
3. Scheduling Automation and Time Zone Management
4. Breakout Rooms and Small Group Features
5. Security and Privacy Controls
The Human Element: **Why 1-on-1 Meetings Matter More Than Ever

As the work-from-anywhere trend continues, several innovations are shaping the next generation of meeting platforms:
AI-Powered Meeting Summaries: Tools like Otter.ai and Fireflies use AI to transcribe meetings and highlight key decisions or action items—ideal for leaders managing multiple direct reports.
Mood and Engagement Trackers: Newer platforms are experimenting with passive feedback tools, like mood indicators and micro-pulse surveys during meetings, to help managers better read the virtual room.
Asynchronous Video and Audio: Not every conversation needs to be live. Apps like Loom and Claap allow users to share quick video updates, freeing up calendars and reducing meeting fatigue.
Customization for Culture Fit: From branded meeting rooms to icebreaker prompts and shared playlists, platforms are focusing on building human connection in the virtual space.
Final Thoughts
1 on 1 meeting agenda, backed by a reliable and intuitive platform, empowers managers to build stronger relationships, drive performance, and retain top talent. In a world where face-to-face interactions are rare, your meeting platform is your culture—make sure it works for you, not against you.]]></summary>

This article will provide insights into why these problems occur and share effective solutions to ensure your images display correctly across all devices.
Why Do Images Lose Quality on Mobile?
Many developers face issues where images look fine on desktop but appear stretched or pixelated on mobile devices. This typically results from how browsers interpret image resolution in relation to device screens. Here are some common reasons:
Fixed Dimensions: Setting fixed dimensions for images in your HTML or CSS might work well on larger screens but could distort the images on smaller screens due to scaling.

You start out super motivated, binge tutorials, build your first button... and then a few days (or weeks) in, you're exhausted. The passion fades. Everything feels overwhelming. And suddenly, Netflix is looking real tempting.
Yeah, I’ve been there.
The good news? It doesn’t have to be that way. You can stay consistent, make real progress, and still have a life — no burnout required. Here's how I manage to keep going (and actually enjoy it) on my own coding journey.
Keep Your Goals Simple and Honest

Between JavaScript and Java, which one do you think is more worth specializing in, and why?
I'm thinking both in terms of career opportunities and what the job market actually demands — both here in Morocco and internationally. I know each has its own ecosystem and strengths, but I'm curious about which one you believe is more future-proof or in demand right now.
If you've worked with one or both, or have insights from your experience or your region, I’d really appreciate your input.

With GPT-4o, more cognitively shallow tasks are becoming candidates for automation.

In particular, repetitive coding patterns — where inputs and rules are well-defined — can be partially handled by LLMs.
Code generation isn't fully autonomous yet.

But when interfaces and data specs are clearly described, it becomes possible to automate part of the implementation and testing process using structured prompts.
This doesn’t eliminate the need for human judgment.

But even if only a predictable subset of code( about 50% of code ) can be automated, the potential productivity gain is worth exploring.
JavaFactory is an IntelliJ plugin built to test this idea.

We'll also troubleshoot the common issues you may face, including unsightly artifacts, improper engraving, and modification difficulties.
Understanding the Problem
When you're trying to engrave text on a curved surface, multiple factors can affect the final outcome. In your case, the goal is to replace an existing embossed watermark on an eyeglass temple mesh with your own custom text. When we use Boolean operations to achieve this, we primarily encounter issues related to the geometry of the c…]]></summary>

Here, we’ll explore what it is and its core components, preparing for a deeper look at JS execution in future articles.
A runtime environment is the system that lets JavaScript code run and interact with its platform. It centers on a JavaScript engine, which parses, compiles, and executes code, turning JS into bytecode or machine code, often via Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation (more on that later!). But the engine isn’t enough. JS is single-threaded, handling one task at a time.…]]></summary>

The traditional inference model, pioneered by companies like OpenAI, revolves around providers offering one or a few large language models (LLMs) with 100% uptime and swift responses. This approach simplifies GPU management since all users share the same LLM, ensuring even load distribution.
However, this convenience comes at a cost:
Users are typically charged based on arbitrary, non-transparent metrics like token count.
The selection of LLMs is sparse, they are usually censored and your data is being trained on. 😕
An alternative is the serverless model, where you rent a GPU instance and install any LLM you want with specialization and features tailored to your needs. This approach offers:

Try to guess what will be printed to console.
Answer

Some explanation:
Parent is parsed and rendered, without useEffect,
Child, when there is no more nested components is turn of async hooks
useEffect from children to parents.

In HarmonyOS Next application development, I personally experienced: whether it is complex business modeling, concurrent processing, or data flow, as long as the functional and object-oriented paradigms are switched reasonably, Cangjie can always express clear and efficient logic in the most elegant way.
In this article, let me take you to explore: how to play with different programming paradigms in Cangjie and master the best practices in actual development.
In Cangjie, the function is "first-class citizen".This means:

The error we're handling today is a C++ compilation error:

In C++, the error occurs when you try to invoke a function that has been explicitly marked as deleted or implicitly deleted by the compiler. This error commonly arises in relation to special member functions such as constructors, copy constructors, assignment operators etc. Functions can be explicitly deleted by the programmer to prevent certain operations or they can be implicitly deleted when certain conditions make them invalid (e.g. if a class member is non-copyable).
Fixing depends on the situation in which the error occurred. Below you find some examples of such situations.
In C++ every function can be explicitly deleted, for example:

This article discusses why this issue occurs and provides step-by-step guidance on how to resolve it, particularly in relation to Unity's handling of types and the default constructor.
Why the Default Constructor Issue Occurs
Unity and .NET use certain optimization techniques when compiling code, particularly for structs. When you run typeof(GZipCompression).GetConstructor(Type.EmptyTypes), it returns null because structs are treated differently than classes; they do not declare a construc…]]></summary>

The future of manual testing in the age of AI is not about being replaces. It's about evolving and transforming the role of manual testers.
Through AI, testers can be able to perform the repetitive task like test case generation, test execution and basic automations.


With help of AI, manual testers can be able to focus on more complex and other activities.


AI will become powerful tool that support testers, allowing them to prioritize critical issues and bring human insight to areas AI will miss to identified those issues


With help of AI, Manual testers will shift from normal validation tasks to identifying the edge cases and evaluating software from real world prespective.


There will be a growing synergy between manual testers and AI. Testers will contribute to training and refining AI models, ensuring they align with actual user needs.


AI will help manual testers to more efficient by offering insights through data analysis,  defect predication and test prioritization.


The manual tester key areas are exploratory testing where unexpected issues may come. UI and accessibility testing which requires manual testers to assess user-friendliness and domain specific testing where industry knowledge is critical.


Also the manual testers will need to upskill in areas like data analysis,AI collaboration and communications.


The future of manual testing is not just secure but its vital as it blends the precision of AI with the understanding that only human can provides.]]></summary>

As of May 2025, Bitcoin mining is looking attractive again. With Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $95,000 and transaction fees hitting new highs after the 2024 halving, mining rewards — though smaller — are worth chasing. From home setups to industrial-scale farms, the question of whether Bitcoin mining is profitable is back in the spotlight.
And if you’re a gamer, chances are you’ve looked at your rig and wondered: Can a gaming PC mine crypto? After all, modern gaming computers are packed with powerful GPUs, solid cooling and lots of downtime, especially if you’re not gaming daily. It’s a fair question: Can you mine Bitcoin with a gaming PC?

Calculating inventory levels in SQL can be tricky, especially when you need to derive values based on previous rows. In your case, we want to compute a new column, Avail_to_fill, which will be the difference between the Onhand quantity and the Qty ordered for each item. This calculation should depend on the preceding row's result.
Understanding the Problem
The table you provided has several columns: ORDER#, Date, Item, Qty, Onhand, and Avl Fill. The requirement here is to create a new column that shows the available inventory (Onhand minus Qty) line by line and restarts the calculation whenever a new Item is encountered. This behavior can be achieved using Oracle SQL's analytic functions and a common table expression (CTE) for structured queries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you're adjusting your schema or moving platforms, you're doing database migration. Whether small or large, migrations help keep your app in sync with changing requirements. This post gives you practical examples and a walkthrough of tools that simplify the process.
1.Schema Migration
Change structure to support new features.
Example:
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN last_login TIMESTAMP;

Use tools like Flyway or Django ORM to track these in code.
2.Data Migration
Needed when changing storage engines, consolidating databases, or upgrading versions.
Example:
INSERT INTO new_customers SELECT * FROM legacy_customers;

Run these in batches or use a managed service for large datasets.
Add indexes for speed
Create constraints for safety
Normalize tables for better structure
Example:
CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);

Flyway: Write raw SQL, versioned
Liquibase: Use XML/JSON changelogs
Django: Auto-migrations with Python models
AWS/GCP DMS: Ideal for cloud-native migrations
Updating your schema, moving data, or shifting databases entirely.
Define scope, create backups, test in staging, automate changes.
Not for every change, but yes for version control, rollback, and CI/CD pipelines.
Loss of data integrity, broken constraints, or downtime. Avoid with dry runs and monitoring.
Migrations are part of growing your application the right way. Whether adjusting models or moving cloud platforms, a structured approach with the right tools keeps your data safe.

As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, users have become increasingly cautious about what they install on their devices. This is where code signing emerges as a crucial practice for developers looking to build trust and increase download rates.
Code signing is a security practice that involves applying a digital signature to software or executable files. This signature is an electronic proof that the code comes from a specific publisher and hasn't been tampered with since it was signed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What Is a Shadow API?


A shadow API is an application programming interface that is created or used without explicit approval from the organization’s IT or security teams. Shadow APIs can emerge from various sources, including developers experimenting with new features, legacy systems that are no longer officially supported but still in use, or services integrated outside of formal IT channels. 
This is part of a series of articles about API security
Unlike official APIs, shadow APIs lack oversight and governance, making them invisible to the security measures typically applied to known and documented APIs. They operate under the radar of standard security and monitoring practices. Because these APIs were not introduced through sanctioned processes, they are excluded from inventory or documentation efforts. 
As a result, shadow APIs present significant risks. They are not subjected to regular security assessments, patches, and compliance checks that would normally be part of an API’s lifecycle management in a secure software development environment.

Like any well-architected system, the solution required robust observability — the ability to track operational behavior, diagnose issues, and maintain visibility across all components. Naturally, Azure Monitor was the go-to choice.
One of the core components of the solution was a custom plugin for Power Platform. To capture application-level telemetry from the plugin, the obvious approach was to use a telemetry client that integrates with Azure Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor.

Handling JSON in Scala can be challenging, especially when dealing with nested JSON strings. In this article, we explore how to effectively decode a JSON object using Circe, a popular library in the Scala ecosystem. Specifically, we want to extract data from a JSON structure where one of the fields is a string that represents another JSON object. This approach is necessary to ensure that we parse and extract information correctly, allowing us to work seamlessly with complex data structures.
Understanding the JSON Structure
The JSON object we receive looks like this:
{"key": "value", "embedded": "{\"foo\": \"bar\"}"}

In this case, the embedded field is a JSON string rather than a direct JSON object. This means that simple decoding techniques may not suffice, and we need to hav…]]></summary>

Creating customized styles for scrollbars can make your website stand out and offer better functionality. In this article, we will go through how to adjust the scrollbar's appearance by changing the size of the thumb and track separately.
Understanding the Scrollbar CSS Pseudo-elements
To create a custom scrollbar, you will mainly be using the ::-webkit-scrollbar, ::-webkit-scrollbar-track, and ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb pseudo-elements. The ::-webkit-scrollbar selector targets the entire scrollbar, while ::-webkit-scrollbar-track styles the track, and ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb styles the draggabl…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[📌 What are Network Protocols?




Network Protocols are a set of rules that define how two systems communicate over the internet.
These rules are organized into layers, each with specific responsibilities.
Layers of Network Communication (OSI Model)



Application Layer
Presentation Layer
Session Layer
Transport Layer
Network Layer
Data Link Layer
(Only Application and Transport layers are the main focus here.)
Client-Server Model Protocols



These follow a request-response model: the client sends a request, the server responds.
Examples:


HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
Used for accessing web pages.
Stateless, one-time connection per request.
Not secure; use HTTPS for encrypted communication.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
Maintains two connections:

At the heart of this transformation are Lambda Expressions, Functional Interfaces, and the Streams API. These features together promote a more expressive, concise, and readable way to write code that is powerful, efficient, and scalable.
In this comprehensive article, we will dive deep into each of these features, understand the underlying theory, and then walk through practical examples with detailed, line-by-line explanations.

Material UI (aka MUI) makes it easy to create responsive design with its powerful Grid system. Let’s see how you can create a completely responsive layout using MUI Grid, step by step, with code you can copy and customize.

MUI's Grid is based on top of CSS Flexbox, and it works on a 12-column layout system. It means you can divide your layout into sections without much stress, and control different section's behaviour on different screen sizes. Now you don't have to write separate CSS media queries all over the place.

Creating visually engaging web content often leads developers to seek ways to draw attention to specific text. One such effect is blinking text, which was once achieved using the deprecated <blink> tag. However, as web standards evolved, the <blink> tag fell out of favor, leaving developers wondering: Is there a standards compliant way of making text blink? In this article, we'll explore modern methods that achieve a similar effect without relying on deprecated elements.
Why the <blink> Tag Was Abandoned
Web standards have changed significantly since the days of the <blink> tag. Introduced in the early HTML specifications, it was intended to help highlight important text. However, as web design principles have matured, the <blink> tag was found to be problematic. Here’s why:

  How To, for Web Applications


A vertical button group is a set of HTML buttons, placed one below the other, without any gap between them. All the buttons form a rectangular block. This tutorial explains how to produce that. It must be stressed here, that the button group as a whole, must be styled appropriately, for appreciation. However, the styling is not much. In fact the CSS coding is not much.
For the project in this tutorial, two vertical button groups are produced. For the first button group, the width of each button and the rectangular block as a whole, is 25% of the width of the webpage. For the second button group, the width of each button and the rectangular block as a whole, is 100% of the width of the webpage.

That's when it hit me – I'm a programmer, for crying out loud! If I can make computers dance, surely I can make my life a little less... chaotic?
So, fueled by caffeine and the fear of becoming a plant murderer, I embarked on a quest to automate my life using nothing but Python. Spoiler alert: It worked. And it only took 100 lines of code. (Okay, 103 if you count comments, but who's counting?)

Creating a functional and visually appealing navbar is an essential part of web development, especially when using React. In this article, we will explore how to design a navbar where links change colors upon clicking—switching between white and yellow. We will use plain CSS along with React's state management to achieve this effect. This approach is simple enough to accommodate beginners yet effective for creating a clean user interface.
Why Use a Clickable Navbar?
A dynamic navbar enhances user experience by providing visual feedback. When users click a link and it changes color, they instantly understand which page they are on. Additionally, it helps in navigation clarity, improving overall site usability.

PostgreSQL provides a rich variety of index types. Each index type is based on specific data structures and principles, and is suitable for different application scenarios. The following will provide a detailed introduction to these nine main index types.
The B - Tree (balanced multi-way search tree) is a self-balanced tree structure. Each node in it can have multiple child nodes (multi-way). Usually, a B - Tree node contains multiple key-value pairs and pointers to child nodes. For example, an m-order B - Tree node can have at most m child nodes, and at least ⌈m/2⌉ child nodes (except for the root node).

This section explains how to set up a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Terraform. Instead of using GCP's managed Kubernetes service, we will install open-source Kubernetes manually inside virtual machines (VMs).
In software and microservice architecture design, it is essential to consider the scalability, availability, and performance of the application. I am proposing the following design considerations when selecting Kubernetes as part of the software architecture:
When the application requires high performance, availability, scalability, and security
When greater control over and maintenance of the infrastructure is needed
When the application architecture involves complex microservices

With the recent enhancements in Tailwind CSS v3.4+, namely @theme and @custom-variant, developers can now implement fully dynamic, type-safe theming using CSS variables, TypeScript, and zero runtime JS logic. This article outlines a theming strategy I came up with, which I believe is a clean and scalable approach built around those tools. It enables easy support for light/dark modes and beyond (daylight, retro, etc.) with minimal complexity.
tailwind.config.js Isn't Enough for Theming


Traditionally, developers define colors like primary, accent, or background directly in tailwind.config.js:

A common issue developers face is accessing the selected choice directly from the ParamSpec. Let's dive into how to do this effectively.
Understanding the DropDown and Connect Closure
When you create a DropDown in GTK, you define the choices it contains. In your example, you have created a DropDown with two options:
let choix = [&quot;Choice 1&quot;,&quot;Choice 2&quot;];
let drop_down2 = gtk::DropDown::from_strings(&amp;choix);

Here, choix is an array containing the two options. The DropDown will display these choices in the user interface. To respond to user interaction, you set up a closure that will be executed whenever the selected choice changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the vast universe of software development, Visual Studio Code has emerged as a key tool—an unexpected bridge connecting worlds that once seemed incompatible. It has become a lifeline for developers coming from the GNU/Linux ecosystem, desperately seeking a way to write desktop applications, something they thought was lost in their environment.
Its versatility allows for development in C#, C++, and FPC Pascal, avoiding alternatives like Lazarus, and offering a more modern and robust option. Personally, I’ve found myself using it as an alternative to Visual Studio 2022, since developing a .NET 6, 7, or 8 application on Linux is financially more viable for my business than doing so on Windows.
But here’s the question: Why does Visual Studio Code feel like an orphaned and underappreciated sibling compared to Visual Studio 2022?
Both serve incredible purposes. Visual Studio 2022 is the enterprise-grade powerhouse, while VS Code is the agile alternative—the gateway for many developers coming from GNU/Linux, looking to explore Windows and its tools, or simply wanting to use .NET Core on Linux. That in itself is a massive achievement, a step forward in software evolution.
Because in the end, bluntly speaking, Linux is great... but if it doesn’t pay the bills, what can I do? As developers, we need to produce high-quality software using high-quality tools. That’s why Visual Studio Code becomes the logical and efficient choice—a path that allows us to keep programming in diverse environments while maintaining productivity and financial sustainability.
Ultimately, VS Code isn’t just a code editor… it’s the bridge that unites worlds that once seemed irreconcilable.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[之前写的后台的控制程序，我采用的都是用VC或者是C#写完之后然后采用AlwaysUp或者是nssm把自己写的后台程序再给做成一个Windows的服务程序。但后来想了想为什么不自己直接写一个Windows的服务程序呢。所以就开始了写服务程序的历程。
首先大致的说一下C#语言写一个Windwos服务程序的方法。说实话C#想写一个Windows服务程序相对的要简单的多。因为C#已经都给准备好了。就在创建项目的选择Windows服务项目就可以了。然后再添加一个服务安装的组件，改一下相关的配置，如：服务名、启动类型、启动权限或者叫启动时的用户。这些信息就可以了。在写代码的时候只要在开始的里面写上服务启动时需要做的工作，在结束里面写上服务停止时需要收尾的工作就大功告成了。
下面主要是说一下采用VC写Windows服务程序。这个我个人觉得相对来说有几个坑需要避。
第一个坑就是如果你从网上查的话都会说用VC写Windows服务程序的入口主函数是ServiceMain()这个函数。而实际并不是，实际上的程序入口还是从main()这个函数开始的。只不过在这个函数中我们不能做太多的事情，必须要尽快的调用StartServiceCtrlDispatcher()这函数来启动ServiceMain()函数。而且ServiceMain()这个函数的名字也并不一定就是这个，可以自定义。只不过你在网上查的人都会采用这个函数名而已。并非VC语言的规定或者约束。这个函数也只不过是在调用StartServiceCtrlDispatcher()函数的时候的一个参数而已叫什么名字并不重要。
第二坑就是服务状态的变换问题，只有你有ServiceMain()函数中调用了SetServiceStatus()函数来告诉Windows操作系统你的服务程序是开始启动了还时正在运行之中还是正在停止之中才可以。在这方面我从网上查了好长时间没有一个写的清楚的。我开始的时候以为这个函数没什么大用于是把相关的代码给删掉了，结果就会发生服务程序的状态无法改变。比如你在启动服务的时候没有及时的状态改成正在运行的话那么Windows的服务控制台就会一直启动这个服务直到启动超时而报错最后服务的状态就会卡在启动状态无法将服务停止或者删除。如果你能将服务状态进入到正在运行状态，但在发出停止服务的时候如果不能将服务的状修改成停止的话那么Windows也会一直停止这个服务直到停止超时而报错。而且这个服务的状态也会卡在停止的状态无法改变。
第三个坑就是在ServiceMain()函数中在用SetServiceStatus()函数把服务的状态修改成“正在运行”的状态之后必须要调用WaitForSingleObject()函数把这个服务的主线程给卡住然就是是一直等待发出服务停止的信号。所以在真正的主线程中你是无法再做其它的任何的工作的。故如果要想写好一个完整的Windwos服务程序就必须在ServiceMain()函数调用WaitForSingleObject()函数之前将你想做的事情都给加载完毕之后再调用WaitForSingleObject()函数将主线程卡住一直等待停止服务的指令。当停止服务的指令来临的时候再调用SetServiceStatus()函数把服务的状态修改成已经停止。
第四个这个不算是坑了这个算是一个常识。就是服务程序的调试问题。如果想调试Windows服务程序那么就只能采用“附加到进程”的方式。即先从Windows的服务管理器中启动服务，然后从Visual Studio的“调试”菜单中选择“附加到进程”的选项然后再选择自己程序的那个进程就可以了。
总结一下，那就是不论是VC写Windows服务程序还是C#写Windwos服务程序，都会有一个开始服务的初始化函数。而初始化函数中不能有死循环，但一般的服务程序又必须要用死循环，所以一个完整的Windwos服务程序一定是一个多线程的，在初始化的时候就启动其它的想要加载的死循环的线程。还会有一个程序的销毁函数，同样在销毁函数中也不能有无法完成的循环。最后就是Windwos服务程序的调试必须采用附加到进程的方式来进行。]]></summary>

This approach works well for small, simple sites but becomes increasingly difficult to manage as the number of pages grows.
This is where React comes in. React, developed by Facebook, has become one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture and powerful routing capabilities make it an ideal choice for multi-page applications.

It is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type. The length of an array is established when the array is created and remains fixed throughout its lifetime. Arrays are used to organize data efficiently and can be defined and initialized in various ways.

Why do you use an array?
Arrays are handy when you want to work with multiple values of the same data type. Instead of declaring individual variables for each value, you can group them together in an array, making your code more concise and easier to manage.

If you're working with TypeScript and enums, you might encounter situations where not handling all enum cases can lead to runtime errors. As seen in the provided code snippet, the Color enum is defined with three values: Red, Green, and Blue. However, not all cases are handled in the getColorName function, which could lead to unexpected behavior. In this article, we'll explore how to structure your TypeScript code to ensure that missing enum cases are flagged at compile time, helping you avoid bugs before they occur.
Understanding the Issue
In TypeScript, when you use enums, it’s crucial to handle every possible value gracefully. If you forget to handle one of the cases, your function may perform as expected during testing but fail in production, leading to hard-to-debug runti…]]></summary>

The state’s custodians can stake the crypto to earn rewards or receive airdrops, which can then be deposited into what Arizona has called a Bitcoin and Digital Asset Reserve Fund.

This problem often arises when importing mixins and functions from Bootstrap or any other library. In this article, we'll explore why this error happens and provide a comprehensive solution to fix it.
Understanding the Undefined Mixin Error
The 'Undefined mixin' error in SCSS usually indicates that the compiler cannot find a specific mixin or function that you are trying to use in your stylesheet. In your case, you're trying to utilize a media-breakpoint-down(md) mixin that is part of Bootstrap's SCSS library. The correct order of imports is crucial since Sass relies on the definitions being available in the scope when they're used.

currentDate := time.Now()
year := currentDate.Year()    // Returns the year as an integer (e.g., 2025)
month := currentDate.Month()  // Returns the month as a time.Month (e.g., March)
day := currentDate.Day()      // Returns the day of month as an integer (e.g., 19)

If you're trying to sort an array of complete filenames and want them sorted by just the filename while retaining the full paths, you're not alone in this challenge. In this article, we'll explore a solution that allows you to achieve exactly that.
Why the Issue Occurs
The confusion often arises from how the sort command works in conjunction with the full paths of files. When you try to sort by default, it considers the whole string, which includes the path. This results in sorting that does not reflect the ordering of the filenames, as seen in your request where sort outputs filenames based on their directory path rather than the filename itself.

Explanation:
If you want somebody not to access specific function through object you can do it by applying the @staticmethod. 
And do not pass 'self' because it will create connection with other attribute.
But if you seen closely general_description is accessible through object and class also. So the question arises does this statement defy us.
Well answer is, Yes, it does.
Here is analogy:
You will kept your screwdriver, hammer or nickel in toolbox, so that somebody want to access it he/she will look for toolbox.


If you travel through airplane doesn't which model of airplane you travel the manual of that plane will remain same like how to tie seatbelt.



Same as goes for static method you just access static method function through class not by object and it doesn't defy its meaning.
OOPs concept is philosophical you follow the rule so that you can have strategy how write code effectively.]]></summary>

That's where the real value lies - improving the conversation, not just documenting it.
It's simple really - teams don't need another tool for meeting minutes.
They need help having better conversations that lead to clearer decisions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write tests before writing the actual code. It may sound counterintuitive at first, but TDD can significantly improve code quality, maintainability, and confidence in your software. This post introduces the TDD process, benefits, and how to start applying it effectively in your projects.
What is TDD?
TDD is a development methodology where tests are written to define desired behavior before implementing the functionality. It follows a short and repetitive development cycle:
The TDD Cycle
Write a Test: Write a test that describes the expected behavior of a feature.
Run the Test: The test should fail because the feature doesn't exist yet.
Write the Code: Write just enough code to make the test pass.

The weakening of the US dollar (DXY) is no longer headline news. With mounting disruptions across the US economy, a declining greenback has become part of the backdrop. Since the start of 2025, the US Dollar Index has dropped 11%, now hovering around levels last seen in April 2022. Markets have largely responded with a shrug.

Starting in C# 13, the language lifts one of its long-standing restrictions: the inability to use ref struct types, ref variables, or unsafe contexts in iterator (yield) or async methods.
This evolution is critical for developers working with performance-sensitive data, particularly through types like:
System.Span<T>
System.ReadOnlySpan<T>
Custom ref struct types
Let’s dive deep into what this change allows, what restrictions remain, and how it helps you write better, faster, and safer C# code.

In a startup, your survival depends on how quickly you can iterate, ship features, and deliver value to end-users. This is where the foundational architecture of your startup plays a big role; additionally, things like your tech stack and choice of programming language directly affect your team’s velocity. The wrong architecture, especially premature microservices, can substantially hurt productivity and contribute to missed goals in delivering software.

The ^ operator (read as "from the end") has been part of C# since version 8, allowing developers to easily access elements from the end of collections:
int last = myArray[^1]; // Last element

However, until C# 13, you couldn’t use ^ inside object initializers. This restriction has now been lifted, giving developers more expressive and compact ways to initialize collections directly.
Let’s explore how this change improves array initialization syntax and simplifies common patterns.
Prior to C# 13:
var countdown = new TimerRemaining();
countdown.buffer[^1] = 0; // Valid

But you could not write:
var countdown = new TimerRemaining
{
    buffer = { [^1] = 0 } // ❌ Compiler error before C# 13
};

Now, this syntax is fully supported.

So what's interesting about the above example, at least to me is it actually runs with javascript disabled!?! So only built in the browser commands will work, but I think this is cool. Really primitive elements that add a better UX to the user can now run in environments without javascript. Also this pattern has better Accessibility out of the box.
You can also write your own custom js events and handlers...
Creating custom commands

  Evolution of Speech Recognition Technologies


The journey of speech recognition technology started as early as the 1950s, predominantly focusing on isolated word recognition. Early systems, such as IBM's "Shoebox," recognized a mere 16 words. The evolution accelerated with the advent of hidden Markov models (HMM) in the 1980s, which allowed for continuous speech recognition. The 1990s saw the introduction of statistically based systems, leveraging vast amounts of data to improve accuracy.
Fast forward to the 21st century, we witness the proliferation of deep learning techniques, particularly the use of recurrent neural networks (RNN) and convolutional neural n…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not long ago, “AI in SaaS” felt like a buzzword, a chatbot here, some automation there. But in 2025, it’s clear:
I recently made a quick YouTube Short that summarizes this shift in just 60 seconds. But I wanted to share a bit more context with the dev.to community, because many of us are building this future.
Here’s what’s really changing:
AI handles what used to be the boring, manual work, form filling, task assignment, ticket tagging, report generation. Not only is it faster, but it actually lets teams focus on solving real problems.
AI isn’t just reacting anymore, it’s learning. We’re seeing apps that adjust to each user: what they click, when they drop off, which features they ignore. AI then reshapes the experience in real time. Feels like magic (but it's models).
Whether it’s predicting churn, forecasting demand, or recommending next steps, smart SaaS tools are becoming proactive. This gives users (and product teams) a serious advantage.
At ClickIT, we’ve been working with startups and mid-size companies to integrate this kind of AI into their SaaS platforms. It’s wild how quickly things evolve once AI becomes part of your architecture, especially when the goal is to scale fast without losing control.
Here’s the video I mentioned, just 60 seconds, made to spark ideas:
How AI Is Revolutionizing SaaS in 2025
Are you already integrating AI into your product?
If not ❌ — What’s holding you back?


And if yes ✅ — What has surprised you the most?



Would love to hear how other devs, founders, and engineers here are approaching the AI shift in SaaS.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Day 23 of the 30 Days of Linux Challenge!

Today we’re entering the world of automation using one of the most powerful tools available in the Red Hat ecosystem: Ansible.
Ansible lets you automate repetitive tasks — like updating systems, installing packages, configuring files, and managing entire server fleets — using simple, human-readable YAML files.
What is Ansible?
Install Ansible on Red Hat Linux
Configure Local Inventory
Run Ad-Hoc Commands
Write Your First Playbook
Run the Playbook
Try It Yourself
Why This Matters
Ansible is a declarative automation engine:
Uses YAML playbooks

Connects over SSH (agentless)
Scales from single node to 1000s of systems
Works perfectly with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Fedora, and more
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-x86_64-rpms

Verify version:
ansible --version

Configure Local Inventory
Create an inventory file:
mkdir ~/ansible
Add this to target your own machine:
localhost ansible_connection=local
Test connection:
ansible localhost -m ping -i hosts

Expected result:
json
List all users:
ansible localhost -m command -a "whoami" -i hosts

Install a package:
ansible localhost -m dnf -a "name=htop state=present" -i hosts --become
Write Your First Playbook
Example playbook:
yaml
name: Basic Setup Playbook
hosts: localhost
become: true
tasks:
- name: Ensure NTP is installed
  dnf:
    name: chrony
    state: present

- name: Start and enable NTP service
  service:
    name: chronyd
    state: started
    enabled: true


ansible-playbook -i hosts setup.yml
This will:
Install htop and chrony
Start and enable the chronyd time service

🧪 Practice tasks:
Install another package using a playbook (e.g. git, tree)
Use Ansible to start or restart a service
Create a user with the user module
Run an ad-hoc uptime or df -h check across multiple hosts
With Ansible, you can:
✅ Eliminate repetitive manual tasks
Whether you’re a sysadmin or DevOps engineer, Ansible is your command center for intelligent automation.]]></summary>

The first approach -and usually the most used by far- is to swap using a third variable, commonly named temporal variable. I'm sure you have seen it already.
void swap(int* a, int* b) {
    int temp = *b
    *b = *a
    *a = temp
}

Yeah, that's a lot of pointers for explaining a swap. Blame C, not me 😒.
Either way the process is the same in all languages:
The value of variable b is stored in a temporal variable
The value of variable a is stored in b
The value stored in the temporal variable is moved to a
I don't think it is necessary to say that the same process can be done replacing a with b and b with a
But what if I told you that there's a way to swap values without using extra memory for a third vari…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When managing Python installations using tools like pyenv, it can sometimes be challenging to ensure that package managers like Homebrew respect the default Python version you’ve set. In this article, we will discuss how to make sure that brew install pipx respects your default Python version (in this case, 3.11.9) instead of automatically upgrading to a newer version, like 3.12. This is a common concern for developers who want stable environments for their applications.
Understanding Pyenv and Homebrew
pyenv is a popular tool for managing multiple Python versions on your machine without affecting the system’s default Python installation. By setting a Python version with pyenv global 3.11.9, you're informing the system to use Python 3.11.9 whenever a Python command is executed.

Bitcoin (BTC) price saw a short-squeeze above $97,000 on May 6, shortly after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that trade talks would commence with China on May 10. At the same time, BTC’s realized capitalization, a metric adding the dollar value of all coins at their last moved price, soared to a new all-time high of $890 billion on May 7, 2025.

  Problem:


You are given an n x n square matrix. Write a function is_toeplitz(matrix) that checks whether the matrix is a Toeplitz matrix.
A Toeplitz matrix is one where every descending diagonal from top-left to bottom-right (↘️) contains the same elements.
Consider this matrix:
6 7 8
4 6 7
1 4 6

The diagonals are:
[1],
[4, 4],
[6, 6, 6],
[7, 7],
[8]
All elements in each diagonal are equal — so this is a Toeplitz matrix ✅.
To check if a matrix is Toeplitz:
Loop through each element in the matrix (excluding the last row and column).
For each element, compare it with the one diagonally down-right from it.
If any of those pairs don’t match, return False.
If the loop completes without mismatches, return True.

    n = len(matrix)

He even crunched the numbers: a potential $60 trillion-a-year market globally.  
The announcement sparked a firestorm—critics say it tarnishes the reputation of his non-profit lab Epoch (already dinged for cozy ties to OpenAI), and worry mass automation benefits companies at the expense of workers. Mechanize boasts heavyweight backers like Nat Friedman, Daniel Gross and Jeff Dean, but the debate rages on: is this the dawn of explosive economic growth or a fast track to a human‐work apocalypse?]]></summary>

O Observer é um padrão de projeto comportamental que define uma relação de dependência entre objetos, onde um objeto (o sujeito) notifica automaticamente outros objetos (os observadores) sempre que seu estado muda. Ele é muito útil quando várias partes do sistema precisam reagir a mudanças em um mesmo ponto.
Esse padrão promove o desacoplamento entre quem emite o evento e quem reage a ele, permitindo que novos observadores sejam adicionados ou removidos em tempo de execução, sem alterar o sujeito.
Em resumo, o Observer estabelece um mecanismo de notificação automática, garantindo que todos os interessados estejam atualizados sempre que algo importante acontece.
As classes que devem reagir a mudanças se inscrevem no sujeito responsável por emitir essas mudanças.
A classe principal recebe os observadores via o método addObserver(), registrando as implementações interessadas em ser notificadas.
O método newStockData() executa a ação principal e, em seguida, notifica todos os observadores inscritos, permitindo que eles executem suas responsabilidades de forma independente.
Assim caso surja uma demanda de adicionar uma nova açãoao newStockData, você não precisaria modificar a classe]]></summary>

In this tutorial, we will explore how to effectively join the AccountingEntity and PeriodEntity when using Entity Framework Core in C#. The aim is to filter AccountingEntity based on a Group parameter while ensuring the Period property is properly initialized from the Periods table. This is a common scenario when dealing with related database tables in a fixed schema situation.
Understanding the Relationship
We are working with two tables: periods and accounting. The primary key in the periods table is a combination of group and id, while the accounting table has periodid that corresponds to id in periods. The relationship between these tables is established by matching accounting.periodid with periods.id, although no foreign key is defined in the schema.

While there are plenty of ready-made templates and tools available, I wanted to challenge myself to build one from scratch. It was a great opportunity to practice core HTML skills and see how structure and content come together in a real-world project.
💡 The objective was simple: design a clean, professional, and structured resume that highlights my background, experience, and skills. I used semantic HTML elements like , , , and  to make the document easy to read and accessible.
🛠️ Key takeaways from this project:
Strengthened my understanding of HTML semantics and layout.
Realized how effective clean structure can be in making content user-friendly.
Gained confidence to move forward with styling (CSS) and possibly hosting it online.
📄 Why this matters: Creating your resume in HTML is not just about having a digital copy—it's a hands-on way to practice front-end skills, personalize your portfolio, and show recruiters or peers your commitment to learning and self-improvement.
🚀 Next steps:
Apply CSS to enhance visual appeal.
Make the layout responsive for mobile devices.
Host it online and maybe even link it to a personal portfolio.
🔗 Final thoughts: If you're a beginner or intermediate developer, I highly recommend trying this out. It’s a simple but impactful way to sharpen your skills while building something meaningful and uniquely yours.

A regular expression (also “regexp”, or just “reg”) consists of a pattern and optional flags. In short, it is the method of matching strings to a pattern.
Two syntaxes can be used to create a regular expression.
const regexp = new RegExp("pattern","flags");

OR
const regexp = /pattern/; //without flags
const regexp = /pattern/flags; 

Regex should be written within forward-slashes /..../. These slashes play the same role as quotes in strings.
The main difference between the syntaxes is that when the regular expression remains constant, use a pattern with a slash for better performance, but if the regular expression is changing, or you d…]]></summary>

But sometimes don't you feel that you want to try something else? Something new?
I want to introduce a different way to build modern web apps using WebAssembly.
It will bring you a next level of frontend world. Mostly, I use Rust alongside WebAssembly because it enables me to utilize a strongly static type system and efficient memory management system that JavaScript and TypeScript lack of.
OK, enough, let's get to the point.
First of all, to make that easy, I recommend to install Rocal which is a full-stack WASM framework to build modern web apps powered by WebAssembly. Here is a command to install it on your MacOS or Linux!

If you’re struggling with a build process that takes around 40 seconds, even with multi-threaded builds using -T and -C flags, you’re not alone. With Maven 3.2.3, optimizing build performance can seem challenging, but there are strategies to help speed things up without compromising your workflow.
Understanding Maven Build Performance
Maven build times can be affected by numerous factors, including:
Dependency Management: The way dependencies are resolved and downloaded can impact build times. For example, if your project relies on a large number of external dependencies, Maven spends time fetching them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Linear search is a simple algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until the target value is found or the list ends.
Start from the first element.

Compare each element with the target value.

If found, return its index.

If not found after checking all elements, return -1.

package com.Example;
        break;
    } else {
        System.out.println("Not occur");
    }

}
sc.close();

}
}
Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) (Worst case: checks all elements).

Space Complexity: O(1) (No extra space needed).

When to Use Linear Search?
✔ Small datasets.
Simple but inefficient for large datasets.

Works on any list (sorted or unsorted).

Easy to implement in Java.

For faster searches, consider Binary Search (O(log n)) if the list is sorted. 🚀]]></summary>

A bad connection strategy can lead to memory leaks, crashes, or endless retry loops.
In this blog, I’ll show you how I built a resilient Redis integration in Express.js using ioredis, lazy loading, and a circuit breaker with opossum.

At first, I used the classic approach:
const redis = new Redis(); // 🤷‍♂️ at the top level

But I quickly ran into issues:
Connection errors on startup if Redis wasn’t ready.
Too many retry attempts without a proper limit.
No fallback strategy during Redis downtime.
So, I rebuilt the entire integration with three key ideas:
✅ Lazy Loading
instead of connecting at startup, I created a singleton getter that initializes Redis on first use:

In this post, we explore four fundamental principles: immutability, function composition, pure functions, and arrow functions.
Immutability means that once a value is created, it cannot be changed. Instead of mutating data, we return new versions with the desired updates.
✅ Why is it useful?
Prevents unpredictable side effects
Easier debugging and testing
Ideal for concurrent environments (like React or Redux)
❌ Mutable example:
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25 };
user.age = 26; // Mutation

✅ Immutable example:

We’re entering the post-smartphone era. Not with a bang, but through quiet disruption. And it’s already on your body.

The Rise of the Wearable Web
I wear a smartwatch that tracks my health, receives notifications, and lets me respond instantly.
Samsung just launched a smart ring — one more layer of ambient computing wrapped around our daily lives.
And of course, I can speak to an AI assistant and get intelligent, contextual responses without touching a screen.
This is no longer sci-fi — this is now.

A New Hub: The Invisible Puck
Imagine:
A tiny 5G/6G puck lives in your backpack
Your glasses are your screen
Your ring is your security token
Your watch handles notifications and health
Voice becomes your primary interface
AI becomes your operating system
No more swiping. No more “app folders”. No more trying to type with your thumb while walking.
Screens Are Becoming Optional
Even today, I can ask my glasses to play a song, call someone, or answer a question — all without touching a smartphone. I don’t need a “phone” to live connected. I just need smart inputs, wearable endpoints, and a cloud intelligence layer.
What This Means
App developers will have to rethink interaction: conversational, contextual, multi-device.
Privacy, identity, and edge computing will take centre stage — because the phone as a walled garden will be gone.
We’ll be more present — or at least, less distracted by rectangles.

The Debate Begins
Will we embrace ambient computing — or push back against losing physical control?
One thing’s clear: the era of staring at your hand all day is giving way to something new.
So here’s the question:
Would you give up your phone if you could wear the web instead?]]></summary>

Understanding the Error
The error message you received states: Error when checking target: expected dense_Dense2 to have 2 dimension(s) but got array with shape 2,5,2. This indicates that the output layer of your model was expecting a different shape for its targets than what it received.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is a lot of noise on "MCP (Model Context Protocol)" and as someone at the forefront of technology we have no choice but to follow it up. Often, despite the initial waryneess the AI hype drains my energy, some careful study turns out to generate useful insights.
MCP is a protocol, but the majority of the protocol work is already done when OpenAI annouced tool use for ChatGPT. What matters now is the standardization process of the publisher of MCP, i.e. Anthropic (Creator of Claude models and tools). In addition to the publications, MCP offers server/client implementations for C#, Python, JavaScript - and that can speed up and streamline the development process.
Whenever an experienced developers sees the tool use API (e.g. from OpenAI), they will immediately think of automatic code generation and streamline and tool definition process, and develop custom tooling to define those tools and serve those tools. MCP offers a ready-to-use (language-of-your-choice) implementation for a stated server.
But here is a critical observation: does MCP has anything to do with AI/LLM at all? It's reinforcing what should have already been done: making systems reflective and accessible from an outside system. Here is a pun: it requires existing systems to be more reasonable (also see Forbes article on GEO).
Traditionally, when a software is developed if the original developer doesn't expose useful APIs then power users have no obvious way of automating it, except through the more hacky GUI automation route. Now with the pressure of AI, vendors have to expose useful interface. LLM with its natural language nature makes it easiser for them to pick, compared to picking a more specific scripting language (or rest API), especially when the MCP server/client framework is stated and uses JsonRPC.

BDD is all about the following mindset: Do not test code. Test behavior.
So it's a shift of the testing mindset. This is why in BDD, we also introduced new terms:
Test suites become specifications,
Test cases become scenarios,
We don't test code, we verify behavior.
Let's make this clear by an example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Deploying a static Next.js app on Hostman is straightforward: connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository, choose your Node.js version, and the platform handles the build and deployment.
For projects that use server-side rendering (SSR), you can set up a Dockerfile-based deployment for full control over the environment.
Deployment time depends on the size and complexity of the app — a basic starter typically takes 2–3 minutes, while larger projects may take longer. If questions or issues come up, live chat support is available to assist.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ollama makes it easy to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your own computer. This simple guide will show you how to install Ollama, run your first model, and use it in a Python script.
 Download the installer from  ollama.ai

 Open the downloaded file and drag Ollama to your Applications folder
 Open Ollama from your Applications
 Download the installer from  ollama.ai

 Run the .exe file and follow the installation wizard
 Ollama will start automatically when installation completes
 Just run this




curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

Ollama is also available as a Docker container:
docker pull ollama/ollama  
docker run -d -v ollama:/root/.ollama -p 11434:11434 --name ollama ollama/ollama

Let’s try Llama 3.2 1B, a compact but capable model:
ollama run llama3.2:1b

The first time you run this command, Ollama will download the model. Once it’s ready, you’ll see a prompt where you can start chatting:
>>> Why is the sky blue?  
The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight travels through the atmosphere, the shorter blue wavelengths of light are scattered more by air molecules than the longer red wavelengths. This scattered blue light comes to us from all directions in the sky, making the sky appear blue during the day.

To exit the Ollama terminal, you can:
  Type  /bye  and press Enter
  Press Ctrl+D (on macOS/Linux)
  Press Ctrl+C twice
Here are some useful commands to get you started:
### List all your downloaded models  
ollama list

### Download a model without running it  
ollama pull llama3.2:1b

### Remove a model you no longer need  
ollama rm llama3.2:1b

### Get information about a model  
ollama info llama3.2:1b

Once you’re comfortable with the basics, you can try the Ollama Python library to integrate it in your Python applications. Check this article  Using Ollama with Python: A Simple Guide.
Enjoy the freedom of running AI locally with Ollama!]]></summary>

If your child has ever asked this, it’s the perfect time to introduce them to HTML—the language behind every website. In this beginner-friendly guide, we’ll explore why HTML is a great first programming language for kids and how to teach it in a fun, engaging way.
Unlike abstract coding concepts, HTML lets kids see immediate results—change a tag, refresh the browser, and voilà! The page updates.
HTML teaches:
Structure (how headings, paragraphs, and images fit together)
Problem-solving (debugging missing closing tags)
Kids can build:
Personal fan pages (for games, sports, or hobbies)
Interactive stories with links and images
Simple games (like quizzes)
After HTML, kids can easily learn:

In my journey through C++17, I stumbled upon the std::byte type and discovered some perplexing behavior that left me scratching my head. The main question is whether this behavior is intended by the C++ standards or if it's a quirk due to the compiler or operating system I am using.
Understanding std::byte
The std::byte type introduced in C++17 is designed to encapsulate the idea of a byte without its conventional mathematical interpretations. Unlike integers, std::byte doesn't implicitly convert to numeric types, which can lead to some interesting outcomes when performing operations with it. In the example I encountered, I defined a std::byte variable and used std::to_integer to convert it to different integer types.
The Code Example

Are you looking to enhance your AM Charts 4 bar chart with stacked columns? In this guide, I'll walk you through adding a series of stacked bars behind existing line and column series to make your data visualization more effective. Creating stacked bars can be tricky, especially with the requirements of filling the entire width of the chart. Let's dive into the issue and provide a comprehensive solution.
Understanding the Problem
Before we start coding, let’s discuss the challenges: the new stacked bars may all be overlapping each other, and they don't seem to fill the chart width as intended. This can result from how your series and data properties are set.
Why Stacked Bars Overlap
In AM Charts 4, when you configure multiple series as stacked and clustered set to false, they …]]></summary>

On paper, SocialFi is a no-brainer. It promises to shift the balance of power in social media — giving people control over how their content and personal data are used and monetized. It even offers users a stake in the $200+ billion social media advertising market, a pie currently devoured almost entirely by giants like Meta.
And yet, SocialFi platforms today feel more like digital ghost towns than the bustling hubs of Web2. Friend.tech, hailed as a breakout star in 2023, peaked at just 80,000 daily active users before falling below 10,000. What's holding SocialFi back? Why does it seem to be following Friend.tech's fade into obscurity rather than rising to rival Facebook's dominance?

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the slow progress I’ve been making. Realistically, work takes up so much time that I barely have any quiet moments to really focus on learning. But I also can’t just give up on my current job.
The only thing I can think of doing: Even if it’s not directly related to a career change, I’ll try to treat my work as a learning opportunity. Slow down, don’t just rush to complete tasks—try to gain experience from each one and reflect on it. Then, use that time to turn it into something tangible and meaningful.

Here’s how I do it, step by step, using only what’s needed for a stable, repeatable workflow.
Why GitHub Packages (and Not npmjs.org)?


Most teams reach for npmjs.org by default, but if your utilities are strictly internal - or have some private contract processing logic you’re not ready to open-source - GitHub’s own registry is more than enough:
Integrated with your repository: No extra accounts or keys to manage.
Scoped access: Control exactly who gets your code.
Familiar workflows: Your team’s already on GitHub; why hop away?

This solution could bolster security and privacy for Web3 in sectors like decentralized finance (DeFi), payment services, and decentralized autonomous organizations.
The TEE framework is the first built upon the native Intel SGX SDK and developed using modern C++, a general-purpose object-oriented programming language often used for operating systems, game development, and high-powered computing.
Safeheron decided to open-source the framework because the company had seen growing concerns across the industry about closed, opaque systems, especially as security incidents have become more widespread.

Hugo 是最受欢迎的开源静态网站生成器之一。用户可以使用 Hugo 来快速搭建自己的网站。
在mac上面，可以使用以下命令来安装hugo:

安装完之后可以使用 hugo version 来查看是否安装好:

安装完 hugo 之后，就可以使用 hugo 来搭建自己的blog网站了。
hugo new site my-blog 来创建一个名为 my-blog 的网站。

cd my-blog
git init

在创建好网站之后，需要选择一个theme。这里有很多主题可供选择：hugo themes
git submodule add https://github.com/olOwOlo/hugo-theme-even.git themes/even


themes/even/exampleSite/config.toml 拷贝到当前目录，并覆盖 hugo.toml
cp themes/even/exampleSite/config.toml hugo.toml

当配置好主题之后，就可以创建自己的blog了。
hugo new content content/post/my-first-post.md 即可创建一篇blog。
content/post/ 下面会出现一个新的md文件。

当前面的配置好之后，就可以使用 hugo server 来启动一个hugo server。


draft,在hugo server 模式下并不会显示draft的blog。
hugo server -D。

以上就可以完成了blog网站的搭建了。

At this point you probably know what MCP is, but if you don’t, no worries - I’ve got you covered. MCP was introduced last year by Anthropic (the company behind Claude) and stands for Model Context Protocol It might sound complex at first, but it’s actually quite simple. MCP is a way to let LLMs (Large Language Models) interact with tools in a open standard way, allowing them to get context from different data…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wondered what keeps your online experience smooth, secure, and sometimes even anonymous? Meet the HTTP proxy — a powerful intermediary that stands between your device and the internet. At its core, an HTTP proxy processes and forwards your HTTP requests, essentially acting as a gateway. Instead of your browser connecting directly to a website, the proxy server does the job on your behalf, masking your IP address and offering a range of added benefits.
To really grasp what an HTTP proxy does, you need to understand its building blocks. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the standard protocol for transferring data online — everything from browsing websites to interacting with web applications. While HTTP operates over TCP/IP and Google's QUIC protocol, it lacks built-in encryption. I…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When dealing with variable length arrays (VLAs) in C, a common concern arises regarding the lifetime of such arrays when a function call is made after their declaration. According to the C17 final draft document N2176, the lifetime of an object, including a VLA, extends from its declaration until the program execution leaves the scope of that declaration. This statement often leads to questions about whether calling a function immediately after declaring a VLA results in ending its lifetime.
To clarify, let's first understand what a variable length array is and its properties. A VLA is a type of array in C where the size is determined at runtime rather than at compile-time. This feature makes VLAs quite flexible for situations where the size of data is not known until the program runs.

If you've recently updated your LSPs in Mason for Neovim and encountered the error message "Failed to run config for lsp-zero.nvim", you're not alone. This issue can arise from misconfigurations or incompatibilities following updates, especially in the context of setting up Language Server Protocol (LSP) configurations in Neovim using Lua. In this guide, we'll explore the possible causes of this error and offer step-by-step fixes to get you back to coding without interruptions.
Understanding the Error
The error message you received indicates that while trying to call a function within the Mason-LSP configuration, Neovim encountered a nil value. Specifically, this error originated in the automatic_enable.lua file of the mason-lspconfig.nvim plugin. This can happen due to severa…]]></summary>

The traditional ways of storing this data just don't scale efficiently or cost-effectively.
What if you had a storage solution that was virtually infinite, incredibly durable, accessible from anywhere, and could adapt its cost based on how you use your data? That's the promise of cloud object storage, and Amazon S3 is the undisputed king of this domain.

Quarkus is a Kubernetes-native Java stack tailored for GraalVM and OpenJDK HotSpot. Quarkus offers incredibly fast boot times, low RSS memory consumption, and a fantastic developer experience with features like live coding.
This quick start guide gets you up and running with Quarkus on macOS, including necessary tools. You will build a basic database application using Quarkus, Java 17, PostgreSQL, and Hibernate ORM Panache. While Hibernate ORM is the standard, powerful Jakarta Persistence implementation capable of complex mappings, it doesn't always make the most common tasks trivial. Hibernate ORM with Panache is Quarkus's solution to this, focusing specifically on making your data entities and repositories simple, straightforward, and fun to write by reducing boilerplate code for common persistence operations.
We'll use standard macOS tools and package managers where possible. These are the essential tools you'll need to complete this tutorial:
- Podman
- SDKMAN
- Java 17
- Quarkus CLI
- Maven
Optionally, you can also install a code editor.
Quarkus integrates seamlessly with containers, especially for development services like databases and other sytems. Podman is a daemonless container engine alternative to Docker.
On Mac, each Podman machine is backed by a virtual machine. Once installed, the podman command can be run directly from the Unix shell in Terminal, where it remotely communicates with the podman service running in the Machine VM. It is almost transparent in usage to Docker and easy to use for development.
Install Podman. Find the latest Podman release on the GitHub Release page, and download the binary for your system architecture. At the time of writing, the latest release was v5.4.1. Install either the unversal pkg installer or the arm or amd version.

Misconfigured Amazon S3 buckets are a leading cause of accidental data exposure in the cloud, resulting in regulatory fines, reputational damage, and costly data breaches. In this lab, we will look at a scenario that uses AWS Config and AWS Systems Manager Automation to automatically detect and remediate Amazon S3 buckets when Public Access Block settings are disabled.
If Block Public Access is disabled on a bucket, either accidentally or unauthorized, AWS will automatically detect the non-compliant configuration and restore the secure settings.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) improves how AI models find and generate relevant information, making responses more accurate and useful. However, as data grows, fast and efficient retrieval becomes essential. Traditional search methods such as brute-force similarity search, are slow and do not scale well.
Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) is a graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search algorithm that offers high speed and scalability, making it a great fit for RAG systems. This tutorial explores how HNSW enhances retrieval in AI applications, particularly within IBM’s AI solutions.

The site, known as Longhorn Pad A, was revived in 2022 after sitting dormant for nearly a decade when Diversified began using it to fuel on-site generators powering cryptocurrency mining computers, according to a report by the Erie Times-News.
Per the report, the operation was launched without obtaining an air quality permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).
Though the company was later granted the permit in December 2023, a March 2025 inspection revealed that Diversified had already removed the mining infrastructure.

Introduction
What is the find Command?
Core find Commands
Real-World Scenario: find Command
Conclusion
Let's Connect

Welcome back to Day 14 of this practical Linux challenge! Today, we are diving into one of the most useful Linux commands: find.
This command helps you search for files and folders fast, flexible, and powerful.

find Command?


The find command is used to look for files and directories in your system based on conditions like:
Name
Size
File type
Date modified
User ownership
And more...
This is especially useful in production environments where systems grow large and messy fast.

find Commands


Basic Syntax for find is
find [path] [condition] [action]

# Example 

find /home -name "file.txt"    - # This searches for file.txt inside the /home directory.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[AWS Lambda is a go-to service for building scalable, event-driven applications — but with great (serverless) power comes great responsibility.
Here are some practical security best practices to keep your Lambda functions secure in 2025:
✅ 1. Use the Principle of Least Privilege
Create dedicated IAM roles for each Lambda function.
Grant only the permissions required for that function to operate.
Use IAM policies with explicit allow/deny for tighter control.
🔐 2. Secure Environment Variables
Instead:
Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store to securely manage credentials, API keys, and tokens.
Access them during function runtime using IAM roles.
🌐 3. VPC Integration for Sensitive Resources
Place it inside a VPC for better network isolation.
Use private subnets with minimal internet exposure.
Attach VPC endpoints for secure AWS service access.
📊 4. Monitor and Log Everything
Amazon CloudWatch Logs for tracking function output and errors.
CloudWatch Metrics to monitor:
Invocation counts
Duration
Throttles and errors
Optionally, integrate with AWS X-Ray for tracing.
📦 5. Enable Versioning and Aliases
Use Lambda versioning to avoid overwriting stable code.
Use aliases (like dev, prod) to route traffic between versions easily.
Helps in rollbacks and gradual deployments.
🚀 Get Started
Start applying these best practices today to make your AWS Lambda functions secure, resilient, and production-ready in 2025.]]></summary>

Part 1
Part 2
Here I will show why this library is actually isomorphic. I'm going to incorporate that sign-in and sign-up examples into a simple Node.js application.

In the past we've looked at, and used, Obsidian and Joplin. While both are great note-taking apps I'd been looking for one that had a responsive webui and possibly the ability to use a local LLM like Ollama or Exo. Blinko is a little like a callback to Mem but self-hosted and able to use local LLM's, adding a level of control over your data. This guide will be a quick setup using Docker, with a few tweaks to avoid a few headaches in getting things working with Ollama(or any AI).
While there is an install.sh script that works, I tend to prefer having a docker-compose.yml file with a few tweaks to bolster security. Below are the contents of that docker-compose.yml file.

We have repeatedly emphasized the importance and necessity of software testing during development and real-life runtime cycles. Path testing, a key process in the testing procedure, is often used in designing test cases. It is a structural testing technique that uses the program’s source code to identify every possible executable path. This helps detect errors and bugs along defined program routes. In this article, we will explore a specific approach to path testing known as the Basis Path Test and its nuances.
Basis path testing often referred to as structured testing, is a white box testing method (testing the software’s internal programming, structure, etc.) used to design test cases. It is performed based on the control-flow graph or log…]]></summary>

Understanding the Grid Layout
The CSS Grid Layout is a powerful tool that enables developers to create complex web layouts with ease. The problem you've encountered arises when attempting to give a clear separation between rows using borders without affecting the individual cells. Instead of applying borders to each cell, we need a different approach to make the entire row's border visibly distinct.

In this article, we will learn how to show navigation options in the AppBar for larger screens and move them to a Drawer for mobile devices. This is an essential practice in building user-friendly web applications. Let’s dive into how we can implement this functionality correctly in Flutter.
Understanding the Problem
You are facing an issue where the drawer icon appears on both large and small screens, which is not the desired behavior. This is a common challenge among Flutter developers, particularly when transitioning from mobile app design to web app design.

It allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage the underlying servers. With serverless, the cloud provider automatically handles the infrastructure, scaling up or down based on demand. This means that developers can focus more on code and less on managing servers, reducing operational overhead.

Modern infrastructure has pushed traditional monitoring approaches beyond their breaking point. Here's why:
Traditional Monitoring Approach:
1. Set static thresholds for metrics

Tornado Cash is a decentralized, non-custodial crypto mixer designed to enhance transaction privacy on public blockchains. It uses smart contracts and zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to conceal the onchain link between the sender and receiver of a transaction.
Launched by Roman Storm and Roman Semenov on Ethereum in 2019, Tornado Cash allows users to send and receive cryptocurrency anonymously, without exposing their wallet history. Unlike centralized mixers, Tornado Cash operates entirely onchain through immutable smart contracts, meaning no central party controls the funds. 
When a user deposits crypto, such as Ether (ETH), Tornado Cash generates a cryptographic note, which the user can later use to withdraw the same amount to a …]]></summary>

When integrating Google OAuth for authentication in your application, you might encounter various errors. One common issue is the ERROR 403: Google disallowed user agent, especially if your code works perfectly on Android but fails on iPhone. This error message usually indicates that Google is rejecting the request due to the user agent string that your app is sending. Let's explore why this happens and how to fix it.
Understanding the Issue
The ERROR 403: Google disallowed user agent typically occurs when Google’s servers identify an untrusted or unsupported user agent accessing their OAuth service. User agents represent the application type, operating system, vendor, and version of the browser, and if the string does not match Google's expectations or security policies, the …]]></summary>

While Node.js is widely adopted in the backend world, I personally prefer Go (Golang) for several key reasons. Here's why.
Go is a compiled language with built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels.
Whether it's handling multiple HTTP requests or processing data-heavy tasks, Go offers consistent and high performance with minimal memory overhead. Its lightweight concurrency model is often simpler and more efficient than JavaScript’s event loop and async/await system.
Go is statically typed, which helps catch errors early during compilation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How We Built Delta Executor: Mobile-First Roblox Script Execution


Roblox's scripting ecosystem has exploded in recent years — and so has the need for tools that empower developers to understand, test, and interact with Lua-based environments. At DeltaDevs, we created Delta Executor, a performance-first, cross-platform executor tailored for Roblox scripts on Android and iOS.
Many tools in the Roblox ecosystem are outdated, unsupported, or overly complex for mobile users. Delta Executor solves that with:
Script execution that’s stable across devices
A secure framework with memory-safe design
Keyless access for paid users (and fair key-based access for free users)
Smooth compatibility across Android, iOS, and emulators for PC
We built it from the ground up to handle the latest anti-cheat systems Roblox introduced in 2025. Here’s how we bypassed them.
-- Delta Executor Example
print("Hello from Delta Executor on Mobile!")

You can load, run, and debug scripts just like this on mobile devices using our tool. Full support for popular script libraries and obfuscation is built in.
While built for mobile-first use, Delta Executor also runs on Windows using emulators like BlueStacks or LDPlayer.
Want to see how it works? Visit our Executor Overview Page.
We're also opening up SDK access for vetted contributors and curious reverse engineers.
Apply at deltadevs.net/developers
We built Delta Executor with security transparency at the core. If you've seen antivirus warnings, you're not alone — many executors trigger false positives. Here's why.

Script Submission
Fix Guide: Executor Not Opening
Delta Executor is more than an exploit tool — it’s a research sandbox for scripters, hobbyists, and curious minds working within the Roblox engine. We hope this adds value to others building tools around Lua, mobile execution environments, and anti-cheat resistance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In tech, we’re wired for growth—more velocity, more releases, more impact, more headcount.
But lately, I’ve been asking myself: Where does it stop?
I’ve led high-performing teams, shipped at scale, climbed the ladder. But with each new role, I noticed a pattern—what looked like “success” on paper often came with hidden trade-offs: less time with family, more stress, fewer pauses to reflect.
We’re told to aim for the next title, the bigger compensation package, the unicorn IPO—as if each step up will quiet the internal noise. But it doesn’t.
Even at the top, many feel like they’re still chasing something just out of reach.
And here’s the kicker: when wealth and power concentrate, whether in tech or society, others get squeezed. I’ve seen brilliant engineers burn out, not because they weren’t good enough—but because the system kept telling them they had to want more.
But what if the real clarity doesn’t come from achieving more—but from needing less?
Less chaos.
I’ve found meaning in simpler things—mentoring a junior dev, walking outside between meetings, unplugging for dinner with my kids. These aren’t productivity hacks. They’re sanity savers.
Because underneath the frameworks and sprint goals, we’re just part of something bigger—organic, changing, deeply human.
The atoms in our bodies? They were once stars. Literally.
We are nature. And like nature, we’re not meant to scale infinitely.
So here’s a quiet question I’m sitting with—and maybe you should, too:

You have two applications:
App 1 → deployed on Server A, port 80
App 2 → deployed on Server B, port 80
When you try to configure both behind SafeLine WAF, you get the error:
Duplicate applications detected on port 80: *


The reason for this error is:
SafeLine allows only one listener on port 80 on the frontend.
⸻


  
  
  ✅ How to solve it


Since SafeLine currently does not support path-based routing, the only supported solution is domain-based routing.
⸻


  
  
  Use different domain names (recommended)


For example:
App 1 → app1.example.com → Server A:80
App 2 → app2.example.com → Server B:80
In SafeLine:
Configure one listener on port 80
Set routing rules based on the Host header (domain name) to forward traffic to the correct backend server.
This way, SafeLine knows exactly which application the request is meant for.
⸻


  
  
  ⚠️ Why you can’t use multiple port 80 listeners or path-based routing



SafeLine can only bind to port 80 once on the frontend.
Multiple port 80 listeners will always result in a duplicate port error.
Path-based routing (/app1, /app2) is currently not supported in SafeLine.
⸻

🚀 Summary recommendation
✅ Use different domain names and set up Host-based routing in SafeLine.
⸻

{"Games": {"key1": "value1", "key2": value2,"key3":value3}}

Now we need to transform the lower layer into a set of multiple layers.
{"Games":{"AllGames":[{"key1":["value1"]},{"key2":["value2"]},{"key3":["value3"]}]}}

SQL itself does not support multi-layer data, making it more difficult to express multi-layer sets, and the indirectly implemented code is very complex. SPL naturally supports multi-layer data and multi-layer sets:
Try.DEMO


A2: Take the lower-layer data (one record), change the type to a set of records, and then transpose it to a two-layer sequence. […] represents a set, function E can convert a set of records into a two-dimensional sequence, and @ p represents transposition during conversion.

So far, you have set up SafeLine and configured it for your environment. Now, it’s time to test your protection, finalize your Docker installation if necessary, and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. This will help you maintain a robust and reliable WAF deployment.
You can test the protection effectiveness either manually or automatically.
Access your website using the parameters configured in SafeLine WAF:
Open your browser and visit:
http://<IP or domain>:<port>/

The default protocol is HTTP; check the SSL option to use HTTPS.
The hostname can be either the SafeLine IP or your website domain (make sure the domain resolves to SafeLine).
The port is the one you configured in SafeLine for the site.
If your website is not accessible, please refer to the Configuration Issues section.

Try these URLs to simulate attacks and confirm SafeLine blocks them:
SQL Injection:
http://<IP or domain>:<port>/?id=1%20AND%201=1

XSS Attack:
http://<IP or domain>:<port>/?html=<script>alert(1)</script>



If SafeLine blocks these, you’ll see the attack prevented in your browser and logged in the dashboard. ✅

sudo yum update

If you get errors like “Could not resolve host” or mirrorlist failures, add Alibaba Cloud repo:
curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo http://mirrors.aliyun.com/repo/Centos-7.repo

sudo yum install -y yum-utils

sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo http://mirrors.aliyun.com/docker-ce/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

sudo yum -y install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

sudo systemctl start docker

If you get x509 certificate errors when pulling images, it’s likely a system time or certificate issue.
Check your system time:
date

If it’s wrong, sync time with:
sudo yum -y install ntpdate

sudo ntpdate cn.pool.ntp.org]]></summary>

The Hello World Container
Docker offers a lightweight "hello-world" image specifically designed to test Docker installations. This minimal container confirms that:
• The Docker client can connect to the Docker daemon.
1.Let's run this test container with the following command:
docker run hello-world


• Check if the hello-world image exists locally
This message confirms that your Docker installation is working correctly.
After running the hello-world container, let's check the list of containers on your system. The container we just ran has already exited, but we can still see it in the list of all containers.
2.To see all containers (including stopped ones), run:
docker ps -a


The -a flag shows all containers, including those that have stopped. Without this flag, docker ps would only show running containers.
STATUS column shows "Exited (0)", which means the container completed its task and exited with a status code of 0 (indicating success).
The hello-world image was downloaded to your local machine. Let's verify this by listing all Docker images:




docker images


This confirms that the hello-world image is stored locally on your system.

In this article, we will explore why these issues might occur and how to effectively resolve them.
Understanding the Problem
The primary issue you are facing when pressing the record button is the lag followed by a crash. This occurs because the camera app attempts to perform heavy processing operations on the main thread, leading to unresponsiveness. Furthermore, the crash arises from improper handling of the GPU resources, resulting in a NSInternalInconsistencyException message about framebuffer overreleasing.…]]></summary>

The system allows Bhutan travelers with Binance accounts to pay for services like tickets, hotel stays, tour guides and other products using at least 100 different crypto assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), USDC (USDC) and Binance-backed BNB (BNB).
The initiative also opens a payment gateway for businesses in Bhutan, enabling them to accept crypto payments through a QR code on a phone, according to an announcement by Binance on May 7.
“This is more than a payment solution — it’s a commitment to innovation, inclusion, and convenience,” Damcho Rinzin, director of Bhutan’s tourism department, said.

This post is not just a dry migration guide — it’s also about the headaches, surprises, and a few decisions you’ll have to make if you’re already deep into a SvelteKit project like I am with shrtn.io. And while we’re at it: Paraglide’s approach to minimalism still makes me smile — even if it makes the docs a bit too... minimal at times.
That said, version 2.0 is a huge step forward. The documentation is better, the architecture is more maintainable, and the framework independence finally feels real. But not everything is an upgrade — especially not the developer experience when removing some of the SvelteKit-specific helpers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today's fast-paced tech world, speed matters. But quality matters even more. No one wants to launch a product full of bugs or deliver a user experience that doesn't live up to expectations. That's where quality assurance (QA) comes in - not as a final check, but as an ongoing, strategic process that ensures everything runs smoothly from the start.
One of the biggest mistakes companies make is putting off QA until later. By then, fixing issues becomes expensive and time-consuming. A robust QA process starts right from the planning stage.
QA shouldn't be an island. Developers, designers, project managers, and QA engineers should work as a team. Communication is key. Clear documentation, shared expectations, and open feedback loops help avoid misunderstandings and missed bugs.
You can't fix what you don't track. That's why a well-defined test plan is essential. It sets expectations, outlines goals, and defines what success looks like.
Manual testing has its place, especially when it comes to exploratory testing or checking visual and UX elements. But automation is the backbone of a scalable QA process.
Smoke tests
Regression tests
API testing
Cross-browser checks
Tools like Selenium, Cypress, or Playwright can help speed up the process. Don't overdo it with automation, though - maintaining flaky tests can slow down your team more than it helps.
Pro tip: CI/CD integration
Hook automated tests into your CI/CD pipeline. That way, every time new code is pushed out, it's tested instantly. Faster feedback = fewer issues in production.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Omit and Pick are some of the most loved utility types in TypeScript. They let you create new types by excluding or selecting specific properties from an existing type.
union types, their behavior can be misleading - and in some cases, break your type expectations
type Employee = {
 id: string
 name: string
 job_name: string
}
type Customer = {
 id: string
 name: string
 company: string
}
type Person = Employee | Customer

❌ Problem: Using Omit Directly
type PersonWithoutId = Omit<Person, 'id'>

🧨 Actual Result:
type PersonWithoutId = {
 name: string
}

Only name survives. The fields job_name and company are lost.
Why?
not distributive over union types. It collapses the union into a common structure, then removes the property - resulting in a simplified, lossy type.
✅ Solution:
DistributiveOmit
We can fix this by explicitly distributing Omit across each union member:
type DistributiveOmit<T, K extends PropertyKey> = T extends any
 ? Omit<T, K>
 : never

type PersonWithoutId = DistributiveOmit<Person, 'id'>

✅ Expected Result:
type PersonWithoutId =
 | { name: string; job_name: string }
 | { name: string; company: string }

🧪 Same Fix for Pick
type DistributivePick<T, K extends keyof T> = T extends any
 ? Pick<T, K>
 : never

type BasicaPerson = DistributivePick<Person, 'id' | 'name'>

But if you’ve ever tried to dive deeper, you’ve probably come across terms like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. It can get overwhelming, especially if you're just starting out.
Let’s break it down in simple terms, without the jargon overload, so you can actually understand what these types of machine learning are all about.

1. Supervised Learning: Learning with a Teacher
In supervised learning, the machine is given input data and the correct output (the “label”). It learns from these examples so that, later, when it sees new data, it can predict the right answer.
Common uses:
Spam detection in emails
Predicting house prices
Recognizing handwri…]]></summary>

But guess what? There's a tool that can help you stay ahead of the chaos. It’s called Liquibase, and it's like having a helpful assistant who always remembers what changes were made, who made them, and when. Today, we're going to break it down - what Liquibase is, how it works (especially with YAML), why it's useful, and how it's being used in real projects like mux-sql.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the smoldering forges of Old Valyria, where data flows like wildfire and downtime is the true enemy, there sits a sovereign of steel and silicon—the MSP40. Forged in the fires of precision and armored against chaos, this managed Ethernet switch defends the Seven Realms of Industry 4.0 with the ruthlessness of Tywin Lannister and the foresight of Bran the Broken. Let us declare why this switch claims the Iron Throne of industrial IoT.

Chapter 1: The Forge of Dragonstone
MSP40 is no mere ironborn gadget. Tempered in the Foundries of Valyrian Steel, it wields powers unseen since the Age of Heroes:
Dragonflame Resilience: Operates from -40°C to +85°C—hotter than Drogon’s breath, colder than the Night King’s touch.
Why it shatters the old order:
Legacy Switches: As reliable as Joffrey’s promises—crumbling under pressure.
Chapter 2: The War of Five Ports
The Battle of Blackwater Bay (Smart Factories):
MSP40 commands robotic arms with the precision of Arya’s Needle, slashing downtime like Lannister soldiers. “Chaos isn’t a pit. It’s a 40% productivity gain,” it whispers.
The Siege of Winterfell (Power Grids):
Guards substations against EMP storms, steadfast as Brienne’s oath. “The North remembers… surge protection.”
The Red Wedding (Traffic Systems):
Halts data collisions at smart intersections, sparing cities from King’s Landing-level gridlock. “The network sends its regards.”

The Words of House MSP40
Ports: 12 channels of fury—8 RJ45 knights and 4 SFP dragons.
The Dragons of Innovation
The Dark Threats Beyond the Wall
Legacy Switches: Bloat like Robert Baratheon’s reign, guzzling budgets and sanity.
The Prophecy of the Prince That Was Plugged In
Epilogue: Winter is Here (And It’s Buffering)
the MSP40 is to court chaos—a realm of molten slag and screaming CFOs. The night is dark and full of packet loss.

This combination provides an excellent security foundation without consuming excessive system resources.
UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) lives up to its name by simplifying iptables configuration while providing comprehensive firewall functionality. 
fail2ban monitors log files and temporarily bans IPs that show malicious behavior, such as repeated failed login attempts.
Together, they create a powerful security layer that:
Controls which services are accessible
Blocks brute force attacks
Prevents various network-based threats
Uses minimal system resources

And your extremely complex PHP tool is sluggish when obtaining facts? The heritage may conceal the problem: MySQL indexes that are either nonexistent or implemented incorrectly.
Working with databases takes up a significant amount of our time as PHP developers. Knowledge of how to optimize such interactions is necessary for developing apps that may be fast, scalable, and easy to use. Similarly, indexing is your secret weapon when it comes to MySQL.
Suppose that a database table is a vast, disorganized library. To find a certain book (or data row) in the absence of an index, one must search across every shelf. Suppose the same library's catalog is now well-structured. …]]></summary>

However, you may notice that the compiler output doesn’t display all the messages you expect, and it seems like Scala is deduplicating these messages, even when they are unique.
Understanding the Issue
The issue arises from the way Scala's compiler optimization handles logging messages. When using quotes.reflect.report.info, the compiler may decide to suppress logging information that it considers duplicate. This can lead to frustration, especially when you rely on descriptive debugging information to trace issues within your macros or templates.

Wallets with less than 0.1 BTC sold around 290 BTC, indicating smaller retail investors are either panic selling or selling out of boredom. 

Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen $4.41 billion in inflows since March 26.

While larger Bitcoin holders remain confident and continue accumulating the asset, data from a crypto analytics platform shows that smaller retail investors have been shedding BTC amid the asset’s prolonged consolidation below the $100,000 price level.

If you haven't seen the movie, here's the gist: Remy is an incredible chef with all the know-how, but he's a rat, so no kitchen access. Linguini is a kitchen worker with full access but little cooking skill. Together, they form a symbiotic relationship: Remy hides under Linguini's hat and guides him on what tools to use and when. 
If a customer orders fries, Linguini might freeze, but Remy scopes out the kitchen, sees what's available, and gives step-by-step instructions: 
"Grab a knife and a cutting board. Now slice the potato." 
Then, Linguini executes the plan.

Yet, even with the best content and design, your emails might still end up in the dreaded spam folder or worse, never reach your audience at all. If you've noticed low open rates or minimal engagement, email deliverability issues could be the culprit.
Let’s explore why your emails aren’t reaching inboxes, and more importantly, how to fix it.
Email deliverability refers to the ability of your email campaigns to reach your subscribers' inboxes. It’s not just about sending an email successfully; it’s about making sure it lands where it's supposed to—the inbox, not the spam folder.
Deliverability is influenced by several technical and content-related factors that email service providers (ESPs) u…]]></summary>

Are you working with multiple instances of TaskListView in your SwiftUI application and encountering a challenge with task state synchronization? If marking a task as complete or incomplete in one instance doesn’t reflect in another dynamically, you’re not alone. This article discusses how to maintain synchronized state across instances of TaskListView, enhancing your SwiftUI app's user experience.
Understanding the Problem
When you have multiple instances of TaskListView, it’s essential to ensure that they can communicate with each other and reflect the same state changes in real-time. The common approach is to maintain a centralized state that allows both instances to read from and write to the same source. This is particularly crucial in applications where real-time data up…]]></summary>

There are 4 main types of hosting, depending on your needs, budget, and technical skills:
What it is: Multiple websites share the same server and resources.
Best for: Beginners, small websites, blogs.
Pros: Cheap, easy to use.
Cons: Limited performance, less control, security risk from other users.
Examples: Hostinger, Bluehost, GoDaddy, Namecheap
What it is: A physical server divided into virtual servers. You get dedicated resources.
Best for: Developers, small-to-medium apps, testing environments.
Pros: More control, better performance than shared.
Cons: Needs basic sysadmin knowledge (SSH, Linux, Docker).
Examples: DigitalOcean, Linode, Hetzner, Vultr
What it is: You get the whole physical server just for your app.
Best for: Large apps, enterprise workloads, high-traffic systems.
Pros: Full control, top performance.
Cons: Expensive, requires advanced knowledge to manage.
Examples: OVH, Liquid Web, IBM Cloud Bare Metal
What it is: On-demand infrastructure with autoscaling, storage, and other services.
Best for: Scalable apps, modern deployments, CI/CD workflows.
Pros: Scales easily, pay-as-you-go, supports containers/microservices.
Cons: Learning curve, can be costly over time if not optimized.
Examples:
Cloud providers: AWS (EC2, ECS, Lightsail), Azure, Google Cloud
PaaS: Render, Railway, Heroku, Vercel (frontend), Netlify (frontend)
Some hosts specialize in Docker/Kubernetes:
For Docker Compose: VPS (DigitalOcean, Hetzner)
For Kubernetes: AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE, or K3s on your VPS

This guide explores how to set up such a system that can integrate JavaScript execution alongside Rust's efficiency while leveraging Deno's secure permission model and web APIs.
Understanding Deno and its Permission Model
Deno is a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that offers robust security through permissions. It allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a browser-controlled environment with controls over which files and network access is available. This makes it an ideal candidate for implementing a plugin system where different scripts can be executed with varying levels of control.

*My post explains variable assignment in Python.
You can unpack the iterable which has zero or more values to one or more variables as shown below:
*The number of variables must match the number of values unless a variable uses *.
v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1, 2]

v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1]
# ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)

v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1, 2, 3]
# ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3)

*The one or more values with one or more commas(,) are a tuple.
v1, v2, v3 = [0, 1, 2]
v1, v2, v3 = range(0, 3)
v1, v2, v3 = 0, 1, 2 # Tuple
v1, v2, v3 = (0, 1, 2)

print(v1, v2, v3) # 0 1 2

*By default, only keys are assigned to variables from a dictrionary same as using keys().
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}.keys()

print(v1, v2, v3) # name age gender

*values() can get only the values from a dictionary.
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}.values()

print(v1, v2, v3) # John 36 Male

*items() can get both the keys and values from a dictionary.
v1, v2, v3 = {"name":"John", "age":36, "gender":"Male"}.items()

print(v1, v2, v3)
# ('name', 'John') ('age', 36) ('gender', 'Male')

The Python code style guide is not set in stone. It evolves continuously with the development of the language. Some old conventions are gradually phased out, and new ones keep emerging. At the same time, many projects have their own coding style guides. When there are conflicts, the project-specific guides should be followed first. However, there is an important principle to keep in mind: "The stupid persistence in consistency is the monster of ignorance", which is a profound insight from Guido. Since code is often read more frequently than it is written, the core goal of the style guide is to improve code readability and keep all kinds of Python code consistent.

Como desenvolvedor que já trabalhou em vários projetos usando essa combinação, posso compartilhar que a curva de aprendizado inicial pode parecer íngreme, mas os benefícios a longo prazo são substanciais.
Na minha experiência, existem várias razões convincentes para escolher esta stack:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I need to find a suitable foundational library for video processing. FFMpegCore works for one-shot things but despite a fluent API, its interface is still too command line like.
Here is what I found out:




OpenCvSharp
LibVLCSharp
FFMediaToolkit




Frames
✅ decode / encode
✅ (via callbacks)
❓


Audio
❌
✅ decode / encode / mux
❓


Extra libs
~5 MB/platform
+7 MB
+7 MB


Licence
Apache‑2.0
LGPLv2.1
MIT


Platforms
Win / mac / Linux / Arm
Win / mac / Linux / iOS / Android
Win / mac / Linux



LibVLCSharp seems more focused on directly displaying things (e.g. in Xamarine and WPF) instead of low-level API based processing; FFMediaToolkit, on the other hand, still depends on FFMPEG and can't avoid licensing issue. Eventually, I had to go with separate video + audio processing in favor of OpenCvSharp (it's Apache-2.0 by the way).
Notice OpenCVSharp has some advantage over EmguCV for custom dev:




OpenCvSharp
Emgu.CV




Licence
Apache-2.0 (fully permissive)
GPL v3 or commercial licence


Interop model
Pure P/Invoke (no C++/CLI), works on any .NET core runtime
Historically C++/CLI wrapper (needs Windows for full feature set), .NET Standard P/Invoke layer added later



NuGet size (native)
4–6 MB per RID (modular runtime packages)
30 MB + for the “opencv‑world” monolith, or 90 MB for emgucv‑runtime‑ubuntu



GPU (CUDA) support
Provided in separate OpenCvSharp4.runtime.dnn package
Official CUDA builds, but Windows‑only binaries unless you compile yourself


API surface
~1:1 with OpenCV C++ names (easy to port C++ samples)
Thicker .NET façade (e.g. Image<Bgr, byte> types), extra helpers


Cross‑platform stability
Actively tested on Windows / Linux / macOS / arm64
Windows the main focus; Linux/macOS possible with libopencv from distro or big runtime package


Learning curve
If you know OpenCV C++ you feel at home
Higher‑level abstractions can be friendlier for newcomers


Commercial support
Community‑driven
Paid licences & support available from Emgu CV, Inc.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coinbase has introduced a new payments protocol for online payments that enables stablecoin transfers over standard internet protocols and AI agents to transact autonomously.  
On May 6, Coinbase announced that it is launching a protocol called x402 for instant stablecoin payments directly over the internet communication protocol HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
It allows Application Programming Interface (APIs), apps, and AI agents to transact seamlessly, “unlocking a faster, automated internet economy,” the firm stated. 
Coinbase said that x402 “is fixing the internet’s first mistake.” The protocol resurrects the experimental HTTP 402 “Payment Required” status code to create a seamless payment system native to the internet.
The firm noted that traditional payment rails, such as credit…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
Understanding memory allocation in Rust, especially heap allocation, is crucial for writing efficient and safe programs. A common point of confusion arises when working with stack and heap memory, as illustrated by discussions in the Rust community. There has been notable inquiry surrounding issues like stack overflow errors, which are often linked to how Rust manages memory. In this article, we will explore how Rust handles heap allocation and clarify why it behaves the way it does.
What is Heap Allocation in Rust?
Heap allocation in Rust occurs when we need to allocate memory dynamically, which is often necessary for larger data that cannot fit on the stack. The Rust programming language helps manage memory through a system of ownership, borrowing, and its smart pointers lik…]]></summary>

Bitcoin must maintain above $95,000 to have a chance at retesting its $109,000 all-time high; failure to hold could lead to a deeper correction, crypto analysts warn.

Several crypto analysts told Cointelegraph in March that Bitcoin may have a chance of reaching new all-time highs in June.

The upcoming Federal Reserve decision on May 7 could influence Bitcoin’s price movement over the coming days.

Bitcoin needs to continue to hold above the $95,000 level for a chance to climb back and retest its all-time high, or face an even deeper correction, crypto analysts say.
It comes after several analysts told Cointelegraph earlier this year that June could be the month Bitcoin (BTC) reaches new all-time highs.

The belief appears to come from an unverified private letter supposedly sent by Yu to a Zerebro investor, trading activity linked to crypto wallets owned by Yu, and the removal of his obituary from Legacy.com.
Others speculate that Yu used a tool to pass off a pre-edited video as if it were filmed in real-time during the Pump.fun livestream.

Understanding Phlex Components
Phlex is a powerful library for creating HTML components in Ruby. It allows developers to craft reusable components easily while leveraging the power of Ruby's block syntax. The yield statement in Ruby is often used to pass control from a method back to a block that is supplied at the point of the method call.

I often randomly test the hyperlinks and they all worked, but I just realize that I only test the longest hyperlinks, because I think they are the ones more prone to hallucinations. I didn't find any hallucinations.
But yesterday I clicked some of the simpler links of r/Conservative summaries and I got 30% of them not working. I panicked because I thought the hallucination caught me off guard, but then I realized all the links were real, but they each got an additional ";" attached to them, which was redundant.
The links themselves were correct but the semicolons I used to declare the end of line was wrongly identified as part of the URLs. The fix was simple. I removed all redundant semicolons from all my current and previous output documents.
I am really surprised of this bug because it affected so many links but it evaded my "random" sampling for so long, because I didn't test the rendered URL links very thoroughly, and I thought very long and complex links were at higher risks of hallucination, so I tested those a lot. Weird enough, those never had problems, but the shorter, simpler links did. I am very sorry for the potential confusion it might have created.]]></summary>

GDP measures the total value of goods and services produced by a country, and it serves as an indicator of the health and growth of an economy. The stock market, on the other hand, reflects the collective value of publicly traded companies and serves as a platform for buying and selling shares. Both metrics are often used to gauge economic conditions, yet their relationship is more complex than a simple correlation.

Today, we live in a world of microservices, APIs, and distributed everything. The architecture is elegant. The orchestration is powerful. But testing? That’s where things get tricky.
As a quality engineering leader, I’ve seen firsthand how this complexity tests more than just code—it tests our assumptions about ownership, accountability, and what “done” really means.
In a microservices ecosystem, a single user journey might hit a dozen services. Each is built, deployed, and owned by a different team. And while unit tests may pass with flying colors, it’s the integration points—those fragile handshakes between services—that often…]]></summary>

In Java, managing complex key structures dynamically is a common challenge, especially when dealing with API response times and performance issues. In your scenario, you're saving keys in a map formatted like Krishna/thota/date/x/y/z while supporting wildcard characters (*) to match various entries. However, this approach leads to performance overhead due to the necessity of comparing strings, which can be inefficient when handling over a million records. We’ll explore better data structures and solutions to enhance performance while allowing for the flexibility you need for matching.

Yet, as those early fans grew alongside the medium itself, uncomplicated childhood memories gave way to reflective curiosity. With maturity comes the realisation that even playful narratives can unwittingly reveal complex truths—sometimes challenging, always intriguing.
Among Spyro's cast, no group invites this reconsideration quite like the Gnorcs. Originally depicted as brutish, green-skinned adversaries to vanquish without second thought, today they stir conversation far beyond simple nostalgia.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most teams spend hours documenting everything.
Notion workspaces. Confluence pages. GitHub wikis. You name it.
But here’s what happens:
☑️New hires still get stuck.  ☑️Devs still ask questions that are, “Somewhere in the docs” and crucial context gets lost.
This is the Documentation Paradox: The more you write, the harder it gets to find, trust, and maintain what actually matters.
Conventional wisdom says, “Async teams need tons of docs!”
But I’ll say: More docs often mean less clarity.
Here’s why:
First, there's the maintenance burden.
Every line of documentation is a liability that needs updating as your codebase evolves.
How many teams actually do that?
Second, comprehensive documentation creates a false sense of security.
Teams believe they're covered because it's in the docs somewhere.
What you should do is treat documentation as a conversation, not an artifact.
Use tools that make updating docs as easy as sending a message.
Encourage annotations and questions directly in the documentation.
And remember the 20/80 rule: 20% of your features generate 80% of questions. Focus your efforts there.
The goal isn't to have everything documented – it's to have the right documentation that actually helps your team move faster.
This is why every Rally session lives forever inside Jira
No more sorting through old Slack threads.
Every discussion stays tied to the task, so your team’s knowledge grows with the work—not in a dusty folder.]]></summary>

In this article, we'll explore how to convert strings while following the two scenarios provided in your request: changing capitalization and formatting string cases to appear more human-friendly.
Understanding the Humanization Process
When we discuss 'humanizing' a string, we're typically referring to text transformation that makes it easier for humans to read or understand. This can involve adjusting capitalization, changing the case, or formatting text to look more polished and readable. Unlike Ruby, where the humanize function applies well-defined transformations, C# requires us to craft our own methods.

When working with Rust and Diesel, you may encounter various issues, especially when performing count queries. In this article, we'll examine a specific error that arises from executing a count query using Diesel with PostgreSQL. The error message states, 'the trait bound i32: FromSql<BigInt, Pg> is not satisfied'. This indicates a type mismatch in your query resolution.
Understanding the Error
The error is primarily triggered because the Diesel ORM expects a specific data type from the SQL count result. Typically, when using the count function in a SQL query, the result is of type BigInt in PostgreSQL, which corresponds to i64 in Rust. However, your code attempts to return the result as an i32, leading to the compile error.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with CodeIgniter, you might want to utilize its query builder feature for better performance and security. For instance, let's consider the SQL query:
SELECT * FROM questions WHERE course_id = 13;

This query retrieves all records from the 'questions' table where the course_id is equal to 13. However, using raw SQL queries in CodeIgniter, as shown below, can lead to issues:
$query2 = $this->db->query('SELECT * FROM questions WHERE course_id = 13', false);

Why is This Query Problematic?
Using this method can lead to potential SQL injection vulnerabilities, and it's not as efficient as using the CodeIgniter Query Builder. Additionally, the parameters need to be validated or sanitized especially when you’re dealing with user input.
Using the Query Builder in CodeIgniter

        <updated>2025-05-06T21:50:59.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, Devs! 👋
I’m excited to announce the release of one-linear-validator, a minimalist and dependency-free JavaScript validation library that provides simple, one-liner functions for validating common data types like emails, phone numbers, URLs, hex colors, dates, and strong passwords.
Why One-Linear-Validator?
I created this package with the goal of providing an easy-to-use validation library that doesn't require complex setups or external dependencies. Whether you need to validate a user’s email, check the strength of a password, or confirm a valid hex color, one-linear-validator has got you covered.
Key Features
Phone Number Validation: Validate international phone numbers.
URL Validation: Ensure URLs are properly formatted.
Hex Color Validation: Verify if the input is a valid hex color code.
Date Validation: Validate dates in the YYYY-MM-DD format.
Strong Password Validation: Ensure the password meets certain strength criteria like minimum length, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
No Dependencies: The library is 100% dependency-free, ensuring that your project stays lightweight and fast.
Installation
npm install one-linear-validator
Or with yarn:
How to Use
Email Validation:
console.log(isEmail('example@example.com')); // { valid: true }
Password Strength Check:
const options = {
console.log(isStrongPassword('P@ssw0rd', options)); // { valid: true }
Phone Number Validation:
console.log(isPhoneNumber('+1234567890')); // { valid: true }
Hex Color Validation:
console.log(isHexColor('#ff5733')); // { valid: true }
Why Build This?
It's lightweight, dependency-free, and solves a common problem that many developers face. Whether you're building a small project or working with large-scale applications, this library is simple to implement and offers consistent, reliable results.
Contributing

Las capas de cascada (cascade layers) en CSS han sido introducidas para resolver uno de los problemas más complejos y persistentes en la escritura de estilos: los conflictos de especificidad. En este artículo exploraremos cuál es exactamente ese problema y cómo la regla @layer nos ofrece una solución eficaz y moderna.
La regla @layer permite declarar estas capas de cascada, que funcionan de forma análoga a las capas en editores gráficos como Photoshop o GIMP: cada capa es un grupo independiente, pero en lugar de imágenes, gestionamos reglas CSS.
El objetivo principal es claro:
Organizar mejor el código.

Hey there, fellow code wranglers! 👋 Pull up a chair, grab your favorite caffeinated beverage, and let's chat about something that's been making my developer life way easier lately: Chrome extensions. Now, I know what you're thinking – "Oh great, another list of extensions. Yawn." But hold onto your keyboards, because these aren't just any extensions. These are the crème de la Chrome, the pixel-pushing powerhouses that'll turn your browser into a lean, mean, coding machine.
Remember that time you spent hours debugging, only to realize you forgot a semicolon? Or when you had to switch between 50 tabs just to find that one Stack Overflow answer? Well, those days are about to become ancient history. Let's dive into 10 Chrome extensi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings to all! In this article, we will talk about a rather unusual topic, information about which for some reason I did not find, although it is quite useful in modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries for creating user interfaces, because, in some cases, applying the concept can help speed up work with the DOM several times.
The name is conditional, but the essence is important.
The term "usual state" refers to data that is saved directly due to the state managers, or due to the internal functionality of the framework or library. An example of the state in Vue.js:
createApp({
  setup() {
    return {
      count:ref(0);
    };
  },
  template: `<div>
        <button @click="count++">Click!</button>
        <div>Clicks: {{ count }}</div>
    </div>`,
}).mount("#app");

In this case, …]]></summary>

If you are trying to implement a video playback functionality that toggles between play and pause states with a button click, you might encounter a few issues along the way. In this article, we’ll revisit your provided code and help you create a fully functional play/pause button for your video. It's crucial to ensure that the button changes its text accordingly while controlling the video playback effectively.
Understanding the Problem
From your description, it seems like you have a solid base but are facing issues with the video not playing upon pressing the button. This often happens due to overlapping function definitions or incorrect function calls in JavaScript. Let’s walk through the potential problems you may have encountered:

In a May 5 filing in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, lawyers for the CFTC filed an unopposed motion for voluntary dismissal, suggesting an agreement with Kalshi. The motion, subject to approval by the court, could end the CFTC’s appeal against a federal court ruling that the financial regulator could not bar Kalshi from listing political event contracts, i.e., bets on elections.

  Demystifying HTTP for Web Developers, Part 2



In Part 1 of this series, we traced the full journey of an HTTP request — from typing a URL in the browser, through DNS resolution and TCP handshakes, all the way to receiving the server’s response. But understanding the path a request travels is only half the story. To truly master HTTP, we now need to dissect the payload that actually moves across the wire: the HTTP request itself.
Every interaction between a web client and a server begins with a carefully structured message — the request. It may look simple on the surface, but every line, header, and byte in that request carries meaning. If you’re building serious web applications, APIs, or even debugging flaky integrations, you can’t a…]]></summary>

Incorporating an MP3 audio player into a PHP script is a great way to enhance user experience on your website. Capturing playback time is particularly useful for tracking how long users engage with audio content. This article will guide you through the process of capturing the current playback value from an audio player implemented with HTML and integrating it into your PHP backend.
Understanding the Issue
You may be using an audio player in your PHP application and want to log how long the audio has been played by the user. This task usually involves a communication between the frontend (JavaScript) and the backend (PHP).

Ever doomscroll your way into developer rage? Yeah, me too.
So yesterday I was minding my own business (aka avoiding Jira) when I stumbled upon a blog where some dude proudly declared:
“Just finished 100 Days CSS Challenge!! 🥳🔥💯”
Cool flex, bro. But when I clicked in, expecting juicy breakdowns, clever hacks, or at least some trauma bonding... all I got was:
copy-paste StackOverflow energy, and I felt like I’d just been catfished by a portfolio piece.
So naturally, I did what any mentally unwell developer would do — I challenged myself to do 100 Days CSS in 10 Days.
Because why suffer slowly when you can suffer FAST?

When developing an iOS application using Flutter, you might come across the need to obfuscate your Dart code. Obfuscation can help protect your code from reverse engineering, making your app more secure. In this article, we'll address how to properly configure the extra_gen_snapshot_options_or_none flag in your Flutter project, particularly focusing on the iOS setup.
Why Obfuscate Dart Code?
Obfuscation of Dart code increases the protection of your intellectual property by making the source code harder to read and understand. This is especially crucial for apps that might handle sensitive data or proprietary algorithms. As Flutter's official documentation suggests, adding the right flags during the build process is vital.

Let’s dive into this topic and explore the best approach to optimize your WordPress site.
Why Too Many CSS Files Can Slow Down Your Website
Having multiple CSS files means that the browser has to make many requests to the server to load all those stylesheets. Each request adds latency, which impacts your page load speed. From an SEO perspective, page speed is crucial as it affects user experience and, consequently, your search engine ranking. Thus, it’s essential to eliminate excess CSS files.

Your team knows TS well
You need Node.js compatibility
Choose Dart if:



Cross-platform is your goal
Dev productivity is crucial
You want single-codebase apps
Pro Tip:

Try Dart for your next internal tool before committing to big projects.
Not for web apps, but it's leading for mobile/desktop.
No, but Flutter Web is now production-ready.
Focused on WASM, not competing with Dart.

If you're trying to scrape specific links from a website using Dart and the Flutter web_scraper package, you're in the right place! Many developers face challenges when attempting to parse HTML and extract the information they need. In this article, we'll address the common issue of receiving a null result when trying to scrape a hyperlink from a webpage.
Understanding the Task
The goal here is to scrape the following hyperlink from the sample HTML provided:
<h3 class="entry-title"><a href="https://mobohng.com/breaking-lol-sit-at-home-order-grounds-again/">This is the way it goes again again</a></h3>

This line of code contains an anchor (<a>) tag nested within an <h3> tag, and we want to extract the href attribute of that anchor tag.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cyber threats are evolving fast, and artificial intelligence (AI) is now playing a major role in phishing attacks. These attacks, where hackers try to trick people into revealing sensitive information, are becoming more advanced.
Did you know? In 2023, over 60% of phishing attacks used AI tools to mimic human writing styles, making scams harder to spot. As artificial intelligence (AI) grows smarter, cybercriminals are weaponizing it to launch sneaky, personalized phishing attacks. But here’s the big question: Can these AI tricks fool even cybersecurity pros? Let’s break it down.
What Makes AI-Powered Phishing Different?
Poor grammar or spelling mistakes.
Can AI Outsmart Cybersecurity Experts?
Hyper-Personalized Attacks

How Cybersecurity Experts Fight Back?
AI Detectors: Tools like Darktrace scan emails for AI-generated text.
How to Protect Yourself
Slow Down: Phishing preys on panic. Check URLs before clicking.
The battle between hackers and cybersecurity experts is ongoing, but one thing is clear AI is changing the game for both sides.]]></summary>

sudo service supervisor restart

sudo supervisorctl restart [program_name]
They might look similar at a glance — both contain the word restart — but they operate at very different levels and are used in very different situations. Let’s break down what each command does, when to use it, and what to avoid in a production environment.

This command restarts the Supervisor daemon itself — not just the programs it manages. Think of it as turning Supervisor completely off and then back on.

Stacks have migrated. Infrastructure is containerized. CI/CD pipelines are green.
But behind the wave of “cloudification”, one question lingers:
Have we really changed the way we think?
Because on the surface, everything looks modern. But underneath?
⏱️ Services running 24/7

💤 Containers sitting idle, waiting for traffic that never comes

💸 Bills growing, even when no one clicks “deploy”
And in every retro, every finance meeting, the same old line:
“The cloud is expensive.”
But is it really the cloud that’s expensive?

Or is it…  
The quiet luxury of feeding CPUs that are just bored?
Let’s be honest.
Cloud-native isn’t Docker. It’s not Kubernetes. It’s not Terraform, or some magic mix of YAML, containers, and CI/CD.

Everyone’s buzzing about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) like it’s the second coming of AI engineering. And honestly? It kinda is. Your large language model is excellent at confidently making things up—because it doesn’t actually know anything beyond whatever data it was last trained on (hello, 2023). 
That’s where RAG comes in: bolting on real, external knowledge so your LLM stops hallucinating and starts reasoning.
But here’s the thing: knowledge isn’t just about facts. It’s about how things connect. And when relationships matter, you don’t want a flat file or a relational torture device. You want a graph.

Bitcoin (BTC) bulls are holding strong around the $94,500 level as the market awaits the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on May 7. Bitcoin analyst Axel Adler Jr. noted BTC’s price strength and pointed out a bullish cluster of long positions forming around $94,400 in the futures market.

EventTarget is the foundation of the browser’s event system.
addEventListener, removeEventListener, and dispatchEvent.
Many core Web APIs including DOM elements like <button>, <div>, <input>, as well as document and window inherit from EventTarget.

When we attach an event handler to a DOM element—like in the picture above—we’re actually subscribing to that element through one of its event channels.
In this case:
The button is the publisher (or emitter)
The callback function passed to addEventListener is the subscriber (or listener)
So when a user clicks the button, the button emits a 'click' event, and all registered listeners for that event type are notified and executed.
So with…]]></summary>

Perhaps you could say I was trying to bring the spirit of Unix to the web.
With this last release of Wanix, I'm at it again. This time with the successor to Unix, a little known operating system called Plan 9 from Bell Labs.

TypeScript has quickly become a favorite tool for developers building scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications. At its core, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript—it builds upon JavaScript by introducing static typing, as well as other modern programming concepts that make your code safer and easier to manage. Static typing means that developers can explicitly define the types of data (like string, number, or boolean) their variables and functions work with, catching potential errors during development instead of at runtime.

TypeScript is a statically-typed superset of JavaScript designed to add type safety and developer-friendly features to JavaScript code. A "superset" means that TypeScript builds on JavaScript by adding new functionalities, while still allowing you to write plain JavaScript. One of its most powerful features is the introduction of types (a system to define constraints on the structure of your data). This is immensely beneficial when working in large projects to detect errors at compile time, ensuring your codebase is reliable and maintainable.

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript. This means that it builds on top of JavaScript by adding an optional type system (a way to define and enforce the kinds of data being used in your code). TypeScript is a powerful language designed to catch errors early during development, making your JavaScript codebases more robust and maintainable.
In TypeScript, "types" play a central role. A type defines the shape of data, specifying what kind of data will be stored, its expected structure, and the operations you can perform on it. For example, string, number, boolean, and object are common types used in TypeScript.

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, adding static types to the language. It is often referred to as a superset of JavaScript because it includes everything JavaScript offers while introducing additional features such as types, interfaces, and enums, which help developers catch errors at compile time rather than runtime. In TypeScript, "types" are a mechanism to define the shape, structure, or behavior of data in your programs, ensuring that your code operates exactly as intended.

In recent years, the world of finance has seen significant advancements, especially with the introduction of blockchain technology. One of the most exciting developments in this space is the concept of tokenization, particularly the tokenization of U.S. equities (stocks). But what exactly does tokenization mean, and why is it so important for U.S. equities? 
What is Tokenization?
Tokenization refers to the process of converting ownership of an asset, such as stocks, real estate, or artwork, into a digital token on a blockchain. This token represents ownership or a portion of ownership of the underlying asset. In the case of U.S. equities, tokenization means turning traditional company shares into digital tokens that are recorded on a blockchain ledger.

I recently launched VidSabio, a platform that transforms ordinary videos into structured, interactive learning experiences — automatically. 🎥➡️📚
But this didn’t come together overnight.
At first, I thought a single LLM could handle everything: analyze the video, transcribe it, generate quizzes, build a course. Easy, right?
Wrong.
It turned out the real breakthrough came when I stopped looking for one model to do it all — and instead built a pipeline of specialized steps, each powered by the best tool for that specific task.
Here’s the high-level breakdown of how it works:
User uploads a video
Video is processed through a multi-step pipeline:
Frame extraction (FFmpeg)
Audio transcription (Google Speech-to-Text)
Visual analysis (Gemini / GPT-4 Vision)
Content summarization + topic generation (Gemini Pro)
Course structure generation (GPT-4)
Interactivity injection (quizzes, accordions, etc.)


Final course can be edited and exported as SCORM or HTML
This is all built using Vue 3, Firebase, and various LLMs (OpenAI + Gemini) stitched together through Cloud Functions.
By distributing the heavy lifting across multiple LLMs and APIs, I was able to:
Improve accuracy
Scale more efficiently
Debug and retry isolated steps
Customize outputs based on step-level feedback
Frontend: Vue 3 + Tailwind
Backend: Firebase Functions + Firestore + Storage
AI: GPT-4.1, Gemini Pro, Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text
Analytics: PostHog
Export: SCORM, HTML
Here's a stylized diagram of the flow:
(Insert your HappyAlien-styled image here)
This was built with plenty of detours, dead ends, and "aha" moments. If you're building with LLMs, I encourage you to explore multi-model orchestration — it might be the key to your next breakthrough.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey DEV community!
I just launched a side project I’ve been tinkering with:
GitVisualize
It lets you paste in any public GitHub repo URL, and it’ll generate a visual representation of that project using OpenAI’s gpt-image-1 model — all based on the repo’s README content.
Takes a GitHub repo URL
Pulls the README
Feeds it to an AI image model
Displays the generated image alongside project metadata
Adds it to a public gallery
You can even choose the image style you want:
Conceptual & Techy
Infographic
Abstract & Minimalist
Direct & Clear
It’s built with Vue 3 + Tailwind, uses Supabase for storage and data, and everything runs through a lightweight backend on Render.
I love browsing GitHub, and I wondered:
“What would this project look like if it were a picture?”
So I built GitVisualize as a fun experiment in combining AI, dev culture, and a bit of creativity. Some of the results are surprisingly expressive.
Frontend: Vue 3 + Tailwind
Backend: Node/Express (Render)
AI: OpenAI gpt-image-1


Storage/DB: Supabase
Design direction: Lighthearted “Happy Alien” aesthetic 🛸
➡️ https://gitvisualize-web.onrender.com/
Paste a repo, pick a style, and see what AI dreams up!
I’d love feedback, ideas, or feature suggestions.

I had done the work. But still, I softened my position. I showed the tradeoffs, invited discussion, and held back from saying with confidence, “This is the direction I believe we should take.”

What I Learned


Before starting the Learn JavaScript course, I knew nothing about the basics or deeper concepts like the DOM, event handling, and async programming. Scrimba's interactive environment made learning super engaging, allowing me to code alongside the tutorials.
Some standout topics I grasped: ✅ DOM Manipulation – Making web pages dynamic with .querySelector() and .addEventListener(). ✅ Functions & Scope – Understanding closures made coding more efficient. ✅ Async JavaScript – Learning fetch() and promises finally made API handling feel natural!

Let’s break down the most powerful and commonly used array functions that every developer should know.
An array is a special variable in JavaScript that can hold more than one value at a time:
const fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];

.push() – Add to the End





fruits.push('mango');
console.log(fruits); // ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango']

.pop() – Remove from the End





fruits.pop();

Before we dive into coding, let's quickly explore why stream+json exists. Often, you need to send large arrays of JSON via APIs. You could send this large array from the server all at once, but when PHP receives it, PHP loads everything into memory.
While this method works, it can cause issues such as:
High memory consumption
Risk of timeout ⏳

The Bitcoin Risk-Off signal dropped to 23.7, its lowest since March 2019, indicating low correction risk and a high likelihood of a bullish trend developing.

Despite the recent decline in network activity, bullish macro indicators like the Macro Chain Index (MCI) suggest Bitcoin could soon rally above $100,000.

On May 5, the Bitcoin Risk-Off signal, an indicator that uses onchain and exchange data to assess correction risk, dropped to its lowest level (23.7) for the first time since March 27, 2019, when Bitcoin (BTC) traded at $4,000. The signal is currently in the blue zone, which historically suggests low correction risk and a high probability of a bullish trend. When the oscillator rises above 60 or turns red, it implies a high risk of bearish movement.

In this article, we'll explore how to decrypt cookie values retrieved from Google Chrome using C#. If you've stumbled upon encrypted cookies in your code and need a way to decrypt these values effectively, you're in the right place. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the decryption process while using C#.
Understanding the Issue
When accessing cookies stored by Google Chrome, it is common to encounter encrypted values. The cookies are stored in a SQLite database, and the encrypted values can pose a challenge when you need to retrieve the actual data. Chrome uses a specific encryption mechanism that relies on Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) for Windows systems. Therefore, to decrypt the cookies, you must understand this encryption approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with APIs, we often encounter data in formats that do not match our application's preferred coding style. For instance, if you're using TypeScript and Vue.js, you might receive data in snake_case from an API but prefer to work with camelCase throughout your application. The good news is that you can easily transform this data without losing type safety. Let's delve into how you can achieve that with the help of interfaces and utility types in TypeScript.
Understanding the Problem
When you define an interface such as MergedReviewDetails, you structure your data according to your application's needs. An example of this could be:
export interface MergedReviewDetails {
  parentReview: Mmcid;
  childReviews: Mmcid[];
}

However, the API might return data with properties in snake_ca…]]></summary>

An idea recently floated by some prominent thinkers in the Ethereum space to reclaim value for the mainnet is the taxing of its Layer-2s. The future of Ethereum does not depend on policy but on enabling frictionless capital movement between the L2s in question. Tariffing rollups may appear a neat way to reclaim value for the mainnet. In practice, it would fragment the ecosystem, drain liquidity, push users toward centralized platforms, and avoid decentralized finance altogether. In a permissionless system, capital flows to where it is treated best, and Ethereum's rollups mistreat it.

Liquidity fragmentation is Ethereum's real threat
In traditional finance, the link between fluidity and growth is well established. Lower barriers to capital inflows lead …]]></summary>

Blockchain has been part of the finance conversation for over a decade now. Yet many professionals remain cautious. 
Many seasoned professionals in finance, wealth management and economics often question blockchain’s relevance, asking, How exactly is blockchain supposed to fit into what we already do?

This question reflects a few key ongoing skepticisms about blockchain within finance.

Passing parameters from ASP.NET MVC page models to TypeScript functions can be tricky, especially when incorporating dynamic values such as token, url, and redirectUrl. In this guide, we will explore how to accomplish this effectively, ensuring that we maintain optimal coding practices.
Understanding the Basics
When working with TypeScript and ASP.NET MVC, it is crucial to understand how data flows between the server-side (C# code) and client-side (TypeScript/VBScript/JavaScript code). The Link.ts you provided defines an interface LinkConfig and an asynchronous function postData. This function needs to be called with correctly structured parameters that are passed from your Razor pages.

Let’s build a simple file upload app with React.js on the frontend and Node.js/Express on the backend using Multer.

✍️ Introduction
At IBM, I led the transformation of one such platform: the Cognitive Support Platform (CSP). Originally built as a monolithic, Salesforce-native application, it had outgrown its architecture. We rebuilt it from the ground up into a modular, event-driven, cloud-native system infused with AI.
The results were real and measurable:
✅ 70% increase in system availability
✅ 90%+ reduction in AI inference costs
✅ 80% improvement in platform security
✅ 70% boost in developer productivity
In this article, I’ll share the architectural strategies, DevOps patterns, and AI integration principles that made this transformation successful and scalable.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of corporate security, not all breaches involve sophisticated hacking tools—some simply walk through the front door. Tailgating, a subtle yet dangerous form of intrusion, happens when an unauthorized person gains access to a restricted area by following closely behind someone who is authorized. It's a tactic that relies less on technology and more on exploiting human behavior.
Attackers often masquerade as employees, contractors, or delivery workers. They may carry packages, wear uniforms, or claim to have forgotten their access badge—all to lower suspicion. Once inside, these individuals can do far more than just roam the premises. They might access critical systems, plant malicious software, or steal sensitive equipment.

In a May 6 joint hearing of the HFSC and House Committee on Agriculture, Rep. Waters remained standing while addressing Republican leadership, saying she intended to block proceedings due to Donald Trump’s corruption, “ownership of crypto,” and oversight of government agencies. Digital asset subcommittee chair Bryan Steil, seemingly taking advantage of a loophole in committee rules, said Republican lawmakers would continue with the event as a “roundtable” rather than a hearing.
HFSC Chair French Hill urged lawmakers at the hearing to create a “lasting framework” on digital assets, but did not directly address any of Rep. Waters’ and Democrats’ concerns about Trump’s involvement with the crypto industry. He claimed Waters was making the hearing a partisan issue and shutting down discussion on a digital asset regulatory framework.

Nothing wrong, right?
Except... I was starting to hate reading my own code.
range(len(...)). Too much manual indexing.
👀 The Realization
for i, value in enumerate(my_list):
    # Do something with i and value

Wait... what?
No range(len(...))? No messy indexing?
✅ Cleaner
🧠 Why it works:
enumerate() is a built-in Python function that returns both the index and the value of items in an iterable—in one shot.
It’s like your loop suddenly gained superpowers.
💡 Bonus Tip:
for i, val in enumerate(my_list, start=1):
    print(f"Item {i}: {val}")

Perfect for user-facing counters. No more +1 hacks.
🚫 Never Again...
No more range(len(...)) unless I really need it.
Now, it’s all enumerate(), all day.
✨ Moral of the Story:
If you're reaching for range(len(...)), stop and ask yourself—
What would enumerate() do? 😎]]></summary>

This problem can be particularly frustrating, as it does not occur when running the app straight from Android Studio, but instead manifests when generating a debug APK via the command line.
Understanding the Issue

Transformers overcome the parallel processing limitations and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies of RNNs/LSTMs, which rely on sequential processing, through the self-attention mechanism. Self-attention simultaneously calculates the relationships between all token pairs in a sequence, enabling parallel processing and helping each token understand the context by utilizing information from the entire sequence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Asynchronous JavaScript can be tricky to grasp, especially for beginners. Concepts like Promises, Async/Await, and the fetch API often seem abstract — until you build something real with them.
In my latest YouTube video, I break down asynchronous JS in the simplest way possible and walk you through how to use it in a real-world project. And what better way to learn than by building something fun… like a Pokémon Fetch App!








  
  
  📌 What You'll Learn


✅ The difference between Promises and Async/Await

✅ How to use try...catch and finally for error handling

✅ Making real API requests with the fetch() method

✅ Applying everything by building a Pokémon project
00:00 – Introduction: What is Asynchronous JavaScript?


01:10 – Promises, Async/Await, try…catch, then…catch…finally


06:30 – API - Fetch


10:39 – Pokémon Project (Hands-on section)
If you're learning frontend development or JavaScript, mastering asynchronous code is non-negotiable. Whether you're handling user interactions, loading data from an API, or building full-stack apps — you need these concepts in your toolkit.
This video blends theory and practice, so you'll understand the "why" and "how" behind the code — not just copy-paste your way through.
In the final part of the video, you'll build a simple app that fetches Pokémon data from a public API. You’ll apply everything you’ve learned and see how it all works together.
Don't just read about async JavaScript — build it.

When working with Svelte and TypeScript, you might run into challenges regarding event typing. A common scenario involves handling input events from an <input> element and wanting to replace the generic any type with a more specific InputEvent. This article will explore how to accurately type the input event in Svelte using TypeScript, allowing you to harness the benefits of type checking while eliminating the use of any.
Understanding the Issue

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Functions are the heart of any programming language, and in TypeScript, they become even more powerful with type safety.
In my latest video, I walk you through how to write and use functions in TypeScript. Whether you're transitioning from JavaScript or just getting started with TS, this tutorial is designed to help you build a solid foundation.
📺 Watch the full tutorial on YouTube:









  
  
  🚀 What You'll Learn:


✅ Declaring functions with TypeScript

✅ Arrow functions vs traditional functions

✅ Typing function parameters and return values

✅ Optional and default parameters

✅ Clean code and best practices
JavaScript is flexible — sometimes too flexible. TypeScript introduces structure by enforcing types, reducing bugs and making your code easier to understand and maintain.
With TypeScript, functions can clearly define:
What kind of arguments they accept
What type of result they return
Whether certain parameters are required or optional
Here’s a quick example:
function greet(name: string = "Dev"): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}


`
This function:
Takes a name parameter of type string

Has a default value ("Dev")
Returns a string



And TypeScript will enforce all of that at compile-time!
Real-life function examples
Why arrow functions behave differently (especially with this)
Tips for writing scalable functions in a TypeScript project

This video is part of my ongoing TypeScript series. If you're serious about becoming a better web developer, learning TypeScript is non-negotiable.

React’s component-based architecture pairs seamlessly with Tailwind’s utility-first CSS framework, enabling rapid development without sacrificing quality. This combo shines in large-scale projects where consistency, performance, and maintainability are critical.
Key Benefits:
 Efficiency: Style directly in JSX, eliminating context-switching to separate CSS files.
📱 Responsive Design: Built-in responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) simplify adaptive layouts.
 Reusability: Encourages modular, reusable components for UI and styling.
 Maintainability: Tailwind’s purge feature ensures lean production CSS.
We’ll use Vite for a lightweight, fast build tool and configure Tailwind with a scalable structure.

Bitcoin CME futures gaps between support at $92,000-$92,500 and resistance at $96,400-$97,400 suggest a period of range-bound trading. 

Bitcoin’s Coinbase premium index, which measures the gap between BTC price at Coinbase Pro and Binance exchange, turned negative after a 15-day positive stint, signaling potential bearish sentiment among US investors.
This drop coincides with Bitcoin (BTC) slipping below $94,000, and the premium’s decline suggests reduced buying pressure on Coinbase, which is viewed as a proxy for both institutional and retail demand.

In a May 5 X post, decentralized science (DeSci) project HydraDAO said that one of its research projects resulted in “rats who had their spines fully transected” being able to walk again. More notably, recovery from surgery reportedly only took five days.

The post featured a video of partially shaved (presumably due to surgery) rats walking in what appeared to be a laboratory setting. The effort in question is the Dowell spinal fusogens project led by Michael Lebenstein-Gumovski, which raised 380,700 USDC (USDC) from donors. The dedicated HydraDAO page reads:

By replacing Prisma Accelerate ($60/month) with a self-hosted Redis caching solution using Twemproxy, we maintained query performance while essentially reducing our database caching costs to zero. The solution works reliably in serverless environments and integrates seamlessly with our multi-tenant architecture.
Serverless applications need efficient database strategies for good performance, but managed services can get expensive as you scale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[RDMA(Remote Direct Memory Access)는 네트워크를 통해 서버 간에 CPU 개입 없이 메모리를 직접 읽고 쓰는 기술이다. 주로 고성능 컴퓨팅(HPC), 대규모 데이터 처리, AI/ML 분산 학습 환경 등에서 낮은 지연 시간과 높은 대역폭을 제공하기 때문에 많이 사용한다. 
1. RDMA의 기본 개념
일반적인 네트워크 통신 방식에서는 데이터를 전송하려면 CPU가 메모리에서 데이터를 읽고, 네트워크 인터페이스 카드(NIC)로 복사한다. 
이 복사한 데이터를 네트워크를 통해 데이터를 보내고, 수신 측에서도 CPU가 데이터를 NIC에서 메모리로 복사한다. 이 과정에서 CPU, 커널, 복사 작업 등이 개입되어 지연(latency)과 CPU 오버헤드가 큰 현상이 발생한다. 
반면, RDMA는, CPU나 운영체제(OS) 커널의 개입 없이, 원격 시스템의 메모리에 직접 읽기(read) 또는 쓰기(write) 작업을 수행한다. 다시 말해, 데이터가 직접 메모리에서 메모리로 이동한다.
2. RDMA가 동작하는 방식
(1) 메모리 등록 (Memory Registration)
송신자와 수신자 모두 RDMA NIC(HCA: Host Channel Adapter)를 사용함.
RDMA를 사용하기 위해서는 사용할 메모리 영역을 등록(pinning)해야 함. 이 과정에서 해당 메모리는 물리 메모리에 고정되고 커널이 RDMA NIC에 메모리 주소를 알려줌. 
(2) Queue Pair 생성
RDMA 통신은 QP(Queue Pair)라는 구조를 통해 이루어짐. 
QP는 Send Queue와 Receive Queue로 구성…]]></summary>

In a Cointelegraph interview, Kozyakov said that while crypto payments are seeing an increase in adoption and demand, the asset class won’t be fully replacing fiat money anytime soon. He said the two asset classes will coexist, with people choosing the more convenient payment option in different situations. 
“We don’t think crypto will replace fiat,” Kozyakov told Cointelegraph. “They will coexist, and people will turn to crypto when it’s the easier, more practical option, whether that’s for payroll, yield or money transfers.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Scraper: The Collector of Car Parts
Each day, the Scraper ventured out, gathering essential tools—brake pads, spark plugs, and oil filters—meticulously putting them in his storage room. This storage room, filled with parts, was like a database, organizing all the precious data he gathered from various sources.
For instance, one day, the Scraper found a batch of brake pads. He cataloged the details, from brand to condition, and stored it safely. This was like collecting the latest prices from websites, storing them in a file for future use.
The Backend Guy: The Toolbox Handler
Whenever the mechanic—the Frontend—needed a specific tool, they would call out, “I need a 10mm wrench!” The Backend Guy, standing by the toolbox, would find the correct tool and hand it over with precision. He didn't fix the car himself, but he made sure the mechanic had exactly what was needed at the right time.
Just like that, the Backend Guy managed the storage of all the data and ensured it was always ready when the Frontend needed it. When the mechanic asked for the current price of the Euro in Toman, the Backend would retrieve that data and send it in a neat package—a JSON response—ready to be used.
The Frontend Mechanic: The User Interface
When the mechanic needed a part, they'd shout, "I need a 10mm wrench!" The Backend Guy would respond, handing over the tool, and the Frontend Mechanic would get to work. The mechanic didn’t care how the part got there, as long as it was the right one.
In the same way, the Frontend Mechanic used the data provided by the Backend to create an amazing display for the car's dashboard. They made sure the car (or website) looked stunning, with neatly organized parts (like the prices) and a smooth-running engine (user interface). Whether it was showing prices in a nice table or providing a simple, user-friendly experience, the Frontend Mechanic made sure everything was visually appealing and functional.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has come a long way since its beginnings. What started as spinning up cloud resources has now grown into a full-blown ecosystem with a very engaged community. IaC on its own can add a lot of complexity to your processes and cause more issues, but combined with governance, compliance, security, deployment strategies, self-service, it easily becomes the fuel your delivery engine needs.
This year, IaCConf debuts as a virtual event by bringing together this community, and it’s shaping up to be one of the most relevant and practical events in the space.
Unlike broader DevOps/SRE or cloud-native events, IACConf is focused on the challenges and innovations around defining infrastructure as code. That means the content goes deeper, the conversations are more relevant, and the takeaways are directly applicable to your processes.
There will be sessions on:
Getting started with IaC
Managing IaC at scale across teams and environments (using OpenTofu, Terraform, Ansible, Crossplane, and others)
Platform Engineering and IaC
How IaC impacts your maturity
AI in IaC
And that’s just scratching the surface. Check out the full agenda here.
One of the things I appreciate most about this conference is that it’s not about product pitches or high-level fluff. Practitioners share what worked, what broke, and how they improved. Whether you are just starting out, are in the trenches, or shaping platform strategy, there’s something for you here.
On another note, I’m also excited to contribute to this year’s lineup with a session on Getting Started with IaC, together with my colleague Emin Alemdar. But honestly, I’m just as excited to learn and to connect with others working through the same challenges.
The event will be on Thu, May 15, 2025 @ 11:00am EDT, so don’t forget to register here.

When I first started learning Go (Golang), everything felt a little strange. Coming from the Python and JavaScript background😅😅., I expected to deal with new syntax, but I didn’t expect to get stuck on the very first line of every Go file:

I remember asking myself:
"Why do we declare the package name before the start of any code?"
📦 What Is a Package in Go?
In Go, as well as other languages like Python, a package is a way to organize and reuse code. Every .go file must start by declaring which package it belongs to.
There are two kinds of packages you’ll encounter early on:
main: This package is special. It tells the Go compiler that this file is part of an executable program.

Understanding repr(transparent)


The #[repr(transparent)] attribute in Rust is used to indicate that a struct represents a single variant of a type that can be safely treated as equivalent to its single field. This is particularly useful for effectively working with opaque types or for implementing newtype patterns.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
When developing Angular applications, particularly with Angular Material, you might encounter issues regarding the mat-list and mat-divider components. Many developers wonder whether to use ngFor inside the mat-list or the mat-list-item and how to correctly place the mat-divider. Let’s delve into this topic to clarify which method is best.
Why This Issue Arises
The confusion around where to implement ngFor and the positioning of mat-divider often stems from how Angular handles component rendering. Using ngFor within the mat-list means that each item is rendered as part of the list itself; thus, the dividers are less likely to show correctly if their placement isn’t considered carefully. Conversely, applying ngFor to mat-list-item makes each list item independent and potentiall…]]></summary>

Unlike traditional firewalls that operate primarily at the network or transport layer, proxy firewalls operate at the application layer.

Many developers encounter challenges when adapting their workflow to the mobile-first approach in Tailwind CSS, especially those who prefer a desktop-first design methodology. While Tailwind CSS v3 made this easier through global configuration options, the introduction of Tailwind CSS v4 has made some of these features feel less intuitive. In this article, we will explore how to effectively configure Tailwind CSS v4 to achieve a desktop-first layout while maintaining responsive design principles.
Understanding the Desktop-First Approach
The desktop-first approach emphasizes designing for larger screens first, and then using media queries to adapt the design for smaller screens. This method allows developers to create a well-structured layout that looks good on large displays b…]]></summary>

예를 들어, meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct에서 훈련(Training) 또는 추론(Inference)할 때, Tensor Type으로 BF16 이면 메모리 크기는 얼마이며, 몇 장의 GPU를 사용해야 하는가에 대해 묻는다면, 어떻게 답변을 해야 하는지 알아 볼 것이다
메모리 사용량 개략적 계산 = (모델 파라미터 * 2) +  파라미터의 2 - 3배 


BF16(bfloat16)은 FP16과 마찬가지로 16비트 정밀도를 사용하므로, 기본적으로 모델 파라미터*자체가 차지하는 메모리는 FP16 대비 큰 차이가 없음.
AdamW 와 같은 옵티마이저 상태나 그래디언트, 중간 활성화 (activations) 등으로 인해 실제 요구되는 메모리는 2~3배 가량 될 수 있음.
계산식: (16 * 2)  + (16GB * 2 or 16GB * 3) = 32GB + (32 or 48 )GB = 64 or 80 GB
BF16 타입으로 풀 파인튜닝(Full fine-tuning)시 



단일 GPU으로는 최소 40GB 이상, 안정적인 배치 크기 확보를 위해서는 A100/H100 80GB급이 1장이 권장

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I have an ambitious technical idea that I hope to share with the community of developers and cybersecurity specialists:
Given the widespread prevalence of pornographic content online, and the difficulty of controlling it through traditional blocking or weak censorship tools, I've come up with a new system:
🔐 An "ethical operating system" (for smart devices – such as Android, iOS, and Windows) built from the ground up on the principle of:
"Completely blocking any type of pornographic content, whether visual or textual, whether on websites, apps, search engines, or social networks."
💡 Key features of the idea:
Its protection cannot be hacked or changed (such as the inability to install an alternative system).
It can be installed on children's devices, school devices, or even the devices of adults who want to protect themselves.
It doesn't rely solely on blocking a specific site, but rather on real-time content analysis.
A clean app store and a clean built-in search engine.
🧱 Technically:
Or as a distribution for children, schools, or conservative environments.
Or even as a layer of security added to existing systems (e.g., Android).
🎯 The goal is not to impose censorship, but rather to provide a safe, ethical, and educational alternative.
🤝 I'm looking for:
Interested programmers. Note that I'm only 16 years old. The goal is to find someone who will embrace this idea.
Suggestions for improving the idea.
Any technical or community support is possible.
Do you think this type of system could make a real difference?

This can be frustrating, especially after seeing the memo correctly set in your workflow execution output. Let’s dive into why this issue might occur and how to address it effectively.
Understanding the Issue
The main problem stems from the timing and lifecycle of updating the memo in your workflow executions. When you call the upsertMemo method, it is crucial to ensure that the memo is set correctly and acknowledged before you attempt to retrieve it from the workflow executions.
In your code, the memo appears to be set successfully, as confirmed by the output of console.log. However, the memo is not persisted as expected when viewed thro…]]></summary>

Dolphins whistle and click to talk in the ocean.
Dogs bark, growl, and wag their tails to show how they feel.
Bees do a dance to show others where to find flowers.

In this article, we will delve into how wctomb works and explore alternative methods for converting surrogate characters to their UTF-8 equivalents.
Understanding wctomb


The wctomb function in C is designed to convert a wide character (of type wchar_t) to a multibyte character (typically in UTF-8 encoding). However, it has its limitations when it comes to surrogate pairs, which are a special way of encoding characters that are outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) in Unicode. These characters range from U+D800 to U+DFFF. When trying to convert these values using wctomb, you might encounter unexpected results.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the smoldering forges of Old Valyria, where currents roar like dragons and energy flows like wildfire, there sits a silent sovereign—the TWCT-T-D55. Forged in the fires of precision and crowned with 1% accuracy, this current transformer rules the Seven Realms of energy monitoring with the ruthlessness of Tywin Lannister and the cunning of Littlefinger. Let us bend the knee to the unyielding guardian of amps and volts.

Chapter 1: The Forge of Dragonstone
TWCT-T-D55 is no mere ironborn gadget. Cast in the Foundries of Valyrian Steel, it wields powers lost to lesser sensors:
Dragonflame Precision: Measures 200A with 1% accuracy—sharper than Oathkeeper’s edge.
Why it shatters the old order:
Legacy CTs: Clumsy as Hodor, bumbling through phase shifts and kWh errors.
Chapter 2: The War of Five Circuits
The Battle of Blackwater Bay (Smart Factories):
TWCTs stalk energy vampires like Arya’s List, slashing waste with Needle-like precision. “Chaos isn’t a pit. It’s a $15k savings,” they whisper.
The Siege of Highgarden (Solar Farms):
Guards solar arrays against hail storms and incompetence, steadfast as Brienne’s oath. “No panel left behind.”
The Red Wedding (EV Chargers):
Halts faulty chargers mid-zap, sparing Teslas from becoming Dothraki funeral pyres. “The North remembers… proper grounding.”

The Words of House TWCT
Size: Slimmer than a Braavosi blade (55mm), deadlier than a Dornish spear.
The Dragons of Innovation
The Dark Threats Beyond the Wall
Legacy CTs: Bloat like Robert’s waistline, guzzling space and sanity.
The Prophecy of the Prince That Was Measured
The TWCT-T-D55 shall unite the grid.”
Epilogue: Winter is Here (And It’s Electrified)

Custom elements are part of the Web Components standard, allowing developers to create reusable components encapsulated in their own HTML tags. Each custom element undergoes various lifecycle events as it is created, added to the DOM, updated, or removed.

“Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow any number of these outputs,” read the announcement on GitHub by Bitcoin developer Greg Sanders on May 5. 
The long-standing limit was originally a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. 
The proposal (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of Chaincode Labs.

The US Department of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old 79 if he serves the whole sentence.
Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn't taken into account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously unblemished 30-year history in business.

Resumes don’t work.
They’re too noisy. You get flooded with titles, buzzwords, and irrelevant project summaries. So I distilled everything down to one single task. One prompt I can give to anyone — junior or architect — and instantly get a signal.
The task?
Write a library that calculates the sum of a vector of values.
That’s it. No extra requirements. The beauty is that it looks trivial — but the depth reveals itself as the candidate explores edge cases, generalization, scalability, performance, and design.
Most junior candidates start like this:

In this post, we’ll explore backend dev using a JavaScript-first approach — with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB as core tools.
Backend dev involves:
Managing servers
Handling databases
Writing business logic
Serving REST APIs
JavaScript (Node.js) – Great for full-stack JS
Python – Django, Flask
Java – Spring Boot
PHP/Ruby – Mature, flexible choices
SQL: PostgreSQL, MySQL
NoSQL: MongoDB, Cassandra
Use REST APIs to perform CRUD operations over HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Tools like Express.js make building APIs fast and flexible.
Express.js (Node)
Django (Python)
Spring (Java)
ORMs help abstract SQL:
Prisma (Node.js)
Hibernate (Java)
Django ORM (Python)
Middleware: Auth, logging, request validation
Authentication: JWT, sessions, OAuth
File Uploads: Multer for handling media
Third-party APIs: Stripe, SendGrid, Google Login
Using JavaScript for both frontend and backend keeps your codebase consistent and efficient. With Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB, you get speed, scalability, and simplicity.
Backend development is essential to building robust, secure, and performant applications. Whether you’re building APIs, managing databases, or integrating third-party services — the backend is where the real logic lives.

Despite the rise of Swift, Objective-C remains a relevant and powerful language, particularly for maintaining legacy code and integrating with newer Swift code bases. As we move into 2025, understanding core patterns like delegation continues to be vital for developers working with Objective-C.
Delegation is a design pattern used in Objective-C to pass messages between objects and to provide a mechanism for customization of behavior. It allows one object to delegate tasks to another, enabling a clear separation of responsibilities and enhancing the modularity of applications.

But as the system expanded to support more than 10 folders, it required deploying and maintaining an equal number of nearly identical Lambda functions, each wired to specific prefixes and jobs. The architecture became increasingly brittle and harder to manage. 
This post outlines how that structure was replaced using EventBridge, with prefix-based filtering and direct Glue job targets. No Lambda. No maintenance overhead.

Encapsulation is like a medicine capsule: the outer shell hides the complex ingredient inside, delivering only the intended effect to your body. You don't need to know the chemical makeup to benefit from it.
Encapsulation is achieved through the use of access modifiers. Python primarily uses two types of access modifier.
Private: Accessible from anywhere.


Public: Accessible only within the class.



Similarly, in programming, encapsulation wraps data and methods in a class, exposing a simple, controlled interface while keeping the internal details private and secure.
Let say I want to make "model" attribute private so that nobody can manipulate the model name.
So make it private just add '__model'
So, question arise if we can't access attribute but we can access function which include the private attribute.
Think of like if we have attribute which you don't want get manipulated then make it private.]]></summary>

If you're developing a MAUI application and are facing issues with the CarouselView control not displaying images from an ObservableCollection, you are not alone. This article will address why images may not show up in your CarouselView, even when the same image sources work perfectly with a standard Image control.
Understanding CarouselView in MAUI
The CarouselView in .NET MAUI is designed to display a collection of items in a swipeable format. Each item can be customized using a DataTemplate, which lets you define how each item appears. Typically, developers use ObservableCollection to bind dynamic data to CarouselView because it notifies the view of changes. However, while you may see indicators appear correctly, images may not load as expected.

A critical feature that sets it apart from other languages is its support for **dynamic typing**. This allows for a flexible development process that enhances code modularity and adaptability. But what truly is the purpose of dynamic typing in Objective-C?

## What is Dynamic Typing?

Dynamic typing refers to the ability of a programming language to determine the type of an object at runtime, rather than during compile-time. This contrasts with static typing, where the type of an object is known and enforced during compilation. In Objective-C, this means you do not have to specify the class type of an object, providing …]]></summary>

In Rust programming, a common error developers encounter is the 'borrowed data escapes outside of method' error. This typically happens when a reference does not match the expected lifetime, causing issues during compilation. In this article, we'll explore the reasons behind this error and how you can fix it to successfully print data from your NodesHeap structure while implementing the Debug trait.
Understanding the Borrowed Data Error
When you implemented the fmt::Debug for your NodesHeap, you're trying to generate a debug representation of your data structure using an iterator. The specific error you received states that the borrowed data escapes outside of the method.

In this blog, we'll demystify state management in Flutter and help you decide between Bloc, Riverpod, and Provider — three of the most popular approaches in the Flutter ecosystem.
State refers to the data your UI depends on. For example:
A counter’s value
Whether the user is logged in
The list of items in a shopping cart
State management is how we keep the UI in sync with the data — especially when multiple widgets care about the same data or when data changes over time.
There are two broad types:

If you're using Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 and noticing that your call to fieldClass.getDeclaredFields() returns an empty array, you're not alone. Many developers have encountered this issue when attempting to retrieve field information from classes in the Java Reflection API. The Java Reflection API is essential for inspecting classes at runtime, allowing developers to gather information about fields, methods, and constructors programmatically. However, certain security restrictions in JDK 17 can lead to unexpected behavior, including the inability to reflectively access declared fields in classes like Field.class from the java.lang.reflect package.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fine-tuning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task or dataset. Pre-trained models, especially large ones like GPT (from OpenAI) or BERT (from Google), are initially trained on massive datasets using general-purpose data. These models learn a broad understanding of language, patterns, or image features. However, for specialized tasks—like medical diagnosis, legal document analysis, or customer sentiment detection—fine-tuning helps the model learn domain-specific nuances.
The process involves continuing the training of the model with a smaller, task-specific dataset while adjusting the model’s weights slightly. This method allows the model to retain its general knowledge while becoming more effective in the target domain. Fine-tuning is far more efficient than training a model from scratch, saving both computational resources and time.
There are different levels of fine-tuning. Some approaches adjust only the final layers of the neural network (known as feature extraction), while others allow all layers to be updated (full fine-tuning). Techniques like parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), are gaining popularity, especially for large language models, because they minimize the number of parameters updated.
Fine-tuning is used in a variety of real-world applications, including chatbots, image generation, fraud detection, and more. It’s especially powerful in scenarios where labeled data is limited but high-quality outputs are essential. With the growth of open-source and pre-trained foundation models, fine-tuning has become a key skill for AI practitioners.
To master techniques like fine-tuning, transfer learning, and prompt engineering, enrolling in a Generative AI certification course is highly recommended.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Abstract
We introduce a novel numerical method, ExpRoot+Log, for function approximation based on a hybrid linear basis consisting of exponential-square-root, polynomial, and logarithmic components. This method achieves high accuracy across smooth, discontinuous, and rapidly decaying functions while remaining simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient. We show that ExpRoot+Log outperforms classical approaches such as polynomials, splines, Fourier series, and even neural networks in key scenarios, offering a new universal baseline for practical approximation.
Introduction
Function approximation is fundamental to numerical analysis, physics, machine learning, and signal processing. Classical bases—polynomials, splines, and trigonometric functions—have known limitations, especially near discontinuities or exponential decays. While neural networks provide expressive power, they are complex, opaque, and computationally expensive.
We propose a new hybrid basis:

This composition handles:

All coefficients are learned linearly (e.g., via least-squares), ensuring ultra-fast performance and excellent stability.

Numerical Evaluation
We tested ExpRoot+Log against standard methods (polynomials, splines, Fourier) across six function types:
Sine
Exponential decay
Step function
Gaussian spike
Absolute value
Composite (piecewise mix)

ExpRoot+Log consistently achieved 1–4 orders of magnitude lower error than polynomials or Fourier bases.
Comparison with Classical Methods

In system design, access control is a critical mechanism to ensure data security and correct authorization of functionalities. Depending on the complexity of the system, the variety of user roles, and the flexibility needed in resource management, there are three common access control models: ACL (Access Control List), RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control). Below is a brief comparison of these three models, outlining their design logic, characteristics, and application scenarios to help clarify the selection and implementation considerations.

When developing an application that requires seamless data exchange between C# and PHP, maintaining character integrity is crucial. If you've encountered issues where characters like 'é' appear as 'Ã©' after data transfer, you're likely facing a character encoding problem. This article will guide you through understanding character encoding and how to resolve these issues effectively.
Understanding Character Encoding Issues
Character encoding is essential for correctly displaying and processing text data. In your case, both the C# application and the PHP server are set to use UTF-8, but inconsistencies can arise during data transfers. This usually occurs when data is transformed in a way that misinterprets the byte sequences of special characters, leading to the corruption of …]]></summary>

And within 2 hours?
Most Job Posts Are Noise
Vague requirements
Tools thrown in without context
Unrealistic experience levels (10 years of Cypress? Sure.)
Zero clue what kind of thinking the role actually needs
I didn't want that. So I stripped it down and wrote it like I write tests: clear, intentional, and designed to reveal behavior.
I ended the post with a line that acted like a trapdoor:
“Want in? Send your resume and a short note on how you found your worst bug to hi@proudcloud.io.”
That was the test.
If you missed it, you failed silently.
The Best Testers Didn’t Just Apply. They Investigated.
But a smaller group took the time, wrote thoughtful bug stories, and sent real applications to the email provided. And those were the ones I called in for interviews.
Some of the best candidates I’ve ever spoken to came from that post.
Sound familiar?
This Isn’t Just About Hiring
The way you write a bug report.
The way you name a test.
The way you respond when something feels off, even if the build says "green."
QA is never just about tools. It's about how you think.
The Full Breakdown
What the full post looked like
How the interviews went
What our actual QA hiring process is like
And why I believe job posts are a mirror of team quality…
I wrote the full breakdown here:

Closing Thought
Because if your words can’t pass the simplest attention check, don’t expect the right people to pass through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
When working with integration tests in .NET 8, especially when utilizing secrets such as clientId and clientSecret, many developers face issues of empty secret values during pipeline execution. This common problem typically arises in environments like Azure DevOps where secrets must be correctly configured and utilized in the pipeline.
Understanding the Problem
In your scenario, it seems the Azure DevOps pipeline does not recognize the secrets added to the library asset group, leading to the variables clientId and clientSecret being empty. This can happen due to various reasons such as misconfiguration of variable groups, permissions, or pipeline setup. Let’s break down the potential issues and guide you through resolving them.

Imagine walking into an engineering department three years from now. The highest-performing teams will be defined by the proprietary AI systems they've built, customized for their specific codebases, architectural patterns, and business domains. These teams will wield AI as a strategic differentiator, not merely consume it.
This is where our industry is clearly headed. As AI increasingly becomes the primary author of code across industries, the strategic advantage will shift from who can write the best code to who can best direct, customize, and optimize AI systems to write that code.
The best engineering teams won't achieve these results by simply adopting off-the-shelf AI coding tool…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked in several agile teams as both a developer and lead developer. One particular project sticks in my mind — a team of ten people, dozens of microservices, and a lot of GitLab repositories to manage.
During each sprint, we were juggling features across multiple repos. At the same time, we were responsible for reviewing each other’s code. Our typical flow was:
Open a merge request (MR) on GitLab
Move the related Jira ticket
Share the MR link in a Teams channel
Move on to the next story
When the workload was light, it was manageable. But in busy sprints, reviews piled up quickly. Large MRs got ignored, or rushed through. And tracking what was waiting, what was blocked, or what still needed input? A mess.
We experimented with several ideas:
Using GitLab labels like needs-review or blocked
Adding Jira tags
Rotating reviewer ownership by repo each sprint
They helped — but they didn’t solve the root problem: lack of visibility and timing.
Code reviews were often asynchronous and scattered. We were switching contexts constantly, jumping between repos, and forgetting which contributions needed our attention.
We didn’t need more tools — we needed a better way to surface and track reviews. Something that would:
Give us a unified view of MRs
Let us know what’s ready to merge, what’s waiting, and what’s blocked
Respect our flow, instead of interrupting it
That’s when I started working on a side project, aiming to solve this specific pain point.
That side project became Bellugo — a contribution tracker designed to help teams stay on top of reviews across repositories without the chaos.
It’s still a work in progress, but if this resonates with your team, I’d love for you to check out the landing page and maybe join the private beta waitlist.]]></summary>

This is a common scenario in web development where removing or replacing tags can enhance readability and maintainability. In this article, we will use Bash commands with regular expressions to achieve this.
Understanding the Problem
In your HTML files, you may come across instances of empty <a> tags that serve as placeholders. For example:
<a id="page_123" class="garbage1"></a> some text <a id="page_124" class="garbage2"></a>

Your goal is to replace these tags with:

After several painful sprints, we implemented five changes to our testing approach that dramatically reduced our testing time without compromising quality. I'm sharing these because they've been game-changers for us, and they might help your team too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🎯 Learning Goals



What are the characteristics of Singly Linked Lists?
What are its time complexities?
ListNode?



Has a value and a next pointer



next is a reference to another ListNode






Order in memory may not be contiguous (unlike arrays which are)
Simple while loop with a current pointer can be used:
cur = ListNode1
while cur:
    cur = cur.next

⌚ Time complexity is O(n) , where n is the number of nodes in the linked list
Now if the Linked List is circular (i.e. last node points back to first) traversing like this would cause an infinite loop.
It would be helpful if we’re keeping track of the head and the tail of the linked list using pointers
Advantage over array is that inserting is always O(1) even if we insert in middle.
Let’s say we wanna add at the end or tail :
tail.next = NewListNode
tail = NewListNode
# or this line 'tail = tail.next', both are correct

⌚ Time complexity is O(1) 
Removing any node is constant time ASSUMING we have a pointer to the previous node.
Let’s say we wanna remove the second node:
head.next = head.next.next
# Just set the next pointer of head to the one after the deleted node

Can be assumed that garbage collection will take place for the deleted node
⌚ Time complexity is O(1) 
For both of these operations, the caveat is if we don’t have a reference to the node at the desired position (head or tail), the time will still be O(n)



Operation
Big-O




Reading/ Access
O(n)


Traversal/ Search
O(n)


Insertion
O(1)*


Deletion
O(1)*



*Assumes you have a reference to the node at the position (if not it is O(n) )

A schematic diagram is a graphical representation of an electronic circuit.

It shows how components like resistors, capacitors, ICs, and connectors are connected on the board.
Helps in diagnosing hardware issues
Saves time in troubleshooting
Improves your understanding of board-level repair
GND (Ground): Usually marked with a downward triangle


VCC / VBAT: Main power lines


Resistor (R), Capacitor (C), Inductor (L)


U, Q, D labels: Indicate ICs, transistors, diodes
Start from the battery input, trace the voltage line, check for filters or protection ICs, and identify where the current flow might be interrupted.
Use a multimeter alongside the schematic to test continuity and voltage levels on each section of the board.

Understanding the Data Structure
The given dataset consists of two columns: Account Number and Previous Number. The Account Number represents the current identifier, while the Previous Number indicates the preceding account number in the group hierarchy. With this structure, we can determine the latest account number for each defined group.

Why Cookie Compliance is Important
Cookie compliance refers to the adherence to laws and regulations regarding the use of cookies on websites.

Every morning, we grab our phones and open a weather app. But ever since I started my 30-day Linux challenge, I’ve been doing it differently.
terminal. Yes, the terminal!
if you need an umbrella. 
🔹 What You’ll Learn:
Check the weather using curl and wttr.in

Customize output
Add an alias for quick access
🔹 Step-by-Step Tutorial (With Code Blocks)
Let’s get into how you can check the weather right from your Linux terminal. No weather apps, no browser — just pure terminal magic. 🧙‍♂️⚡
✅ Step 1: Open Your Terminal
You can open it by pressing:

✅ Step 2: Use curl with wttr.in
This command shows you the weather forecast in your current city using the terminal:

✅ Step 3: Check Weather for a Specific City
Want to check the weather in Delhi, UK, or USA? Just add the city name:


✅ Step 4: Customize the Output

🎯 Metric Units (Celsius)

🧼 No ASCII Graphics (Plain Output)

✅ Step 5: Create a Weather Shortcut (Alias)
Want to type weather instead of writing the full command every time?
.bashrc or .zshrc file. In my Case, I'm using .zshrc file. 
Edit your .zshrc file with nano ~/.zshrc.

Add the alias to .zshrc with alias weather="curl wttr.in"

Save and exit the editor




Press Ctrl + X to exit.
Press Y to confirm changes.
Press Enter to save the file.

To write something in the terminal or display text, you can use commands like:
echo: For printing messages.
cat >: To write multiple lines into a file.
nano: For directly editing files in the terminal.
tee: For displaying text and saving it to a file simultaneously.
These simple commands let you write, edit, and manage text efficiently from the terminal.

When compiling programs in C or C++ using cc or c++, you may find yourself needing to use a different linker than the default one. For instance, your version of GCC or Clang might link against /usr/bin/ld. In many scenarios, developers want to test their applications with alternative linkers, like /usr/local/bin/ld, for various reasons, including performance evaluation or compatibility testing. In this article, we’ll explore how to specify a different linker without running separate compilation steps.
Why the Default Linker Matters
The linker plays a crucial role in the compilation process, as it's responsible for combining different object files into a single executable. By default, compilers like GCC and Clang use a hard-coded linker, typically located at /usr/bin/ld on Unix…]]></summary>

In our era, the cloud is the haute couture of infrastructure. Everyone wants it. Everyone says you need it. And few ask whether it actually fits.

And here are 12 reasons why on-premise will outlast the hype.
The cloud sells convenience, but charges premium rent, forever. When you buy servers, you own an asset. When you rent a VM, you feed a meter. The cloud is like living in a hotel room and bragging you don’t have to fix the faucet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Devs, I’m Harrison G Herdzik — a full-time tech student at Western Connecticut State University and founder of Harrison’s Tech Solutions, a small business offering practical IT support for local clients.
Balancing academics, client requests, and business admin might sound chaotic, but I’ve developed a lightweight but effective workflow that keeps me sane and productive.
Here’s how I do it — and how you can adapt it to your own side-hustle or service-based business.
🧰 My Tech Stack for Client Management
CRM & Task Tracking: Notion
Scheduling & Booking: Calendly
Remote Support: AnyDesk
Invoicing: Wave
Communication: Gmail + Google Meet
Documentation: Google Docs + Loom for quick video walkthroughs
Each tool solves a specific problem. The goal isn’t complexity — it’s clarity and control.
**💬 How I Communicate With Clients
*Here’s my approach:

Keep emails concise but informative
Use screen recordings (Loom) when words fall short
Set clear expectations and timelines from the start
Document every service — even one-off calls
That’s something I learned early on: people appreciate clarity, not cleverness.
**⏱️ Time Management as a Student & Founder
⏰** Morning:** Classwork, assignments
💻 Afternoon: Scheduled client calls or remote work
📑 Evening: Admin tasks, follow-ups, learning new tech tools
By blocking time and batching tasks, I reduce context switching. And if a client emergency comes up? I leave a 1-hour buffer each day just in case.
🚀 Advice from Harrison Herdzik to Aspiring Student Founders
 Your first client might be a family friend — that’s okay.
Document your work. It builds trust and repeat business.
Say no to bad fits. Focus on clients you can genuinely help.
Keep learning. The tech world changes fast — be ready.
Whether you’re offering dev services, IT help, or consulting — your time, your tools, and your tone all matter.]]></summary>

PBCs are for-profit companies that are legally obligated to prioritize a social mission alongside the interests of shareholders. 
The plans mark a reversal for OpenAI, which had previously floated a for-profit conversion involving spinning out the nonprofit entity.

If you've ever tried to implement a modal that slides in from the bottom after being triggered by a button, you might have encountered an unexpected behavior when using a <button> element inside your modal dialog. This is a common issue that developers face, especially when working with CSS animations. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and how you can fix it effectively.
Why Does This Happen?
The problem often arises from the way CSS handles layout changes during animations. When the modal is opened, if a button element is included, it may trigger a reflow in the browser’s layout engine. This reflow can result in the appearance of a scrollbar, which disrupts the fluidity of your animation. The pointer-events property combin…]]></summary>

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Finzer said that during Biden's administration the agency unfairly targeted good actors in the crypto space, including OpenSea. “There's all sorts of digital assets, you know, you shouldn't treat them all the same. That's obvious. But I think the approach that the prior SEC was taking was kind of this, you know, very, very generic.”

Isso é ineficiente.

A solução? debounce()
debounce?


É uma técnica usada para adiar a execução de uma função até que um tempo específico tenha passado sem novas chamadas.
É muito usado em:
buscas dinâmicas (auto-complete)
eventos de rolagem (scroll)
eventos de resize
Imagine um campo de busca que chama a API a cada tecla:
function search(term) {
  fetch(`https://api.exemplo.com/search?q=${term}`)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(console.log);
}

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  search(e.target.value);
});

Isso gera chamadas demais.
Agora, com debounce:
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timer;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => fn(...args), delay);
  };
}

const debouncedSearch = debounce(search, 500);

input.addEventListener("input", (e) => {
  debouncedSearch(e.target.value);
});

Agora só é chamada a API depois que o usuário parar de digitar por 500ms.
No React, pode usar com useCallback ou bibliotecas como lodash.debounce:
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';

const debounced = useCallback(
  debounce((value) => {
    // chamada de API aqui
  }, 300),
  []
);

If you're working with Hibernate and querying a DB2 z/OS database, you might have faced a common issue where the generated SQL queries include unnecessary cast statements, especially after upgrading to Hibernate 6. This can cause errors as certain DB2 versions don't support those casts. In this article, we will explore why this issue occurs and provide solutions to remove the cast statements for compatibility with DB2 z/OS.
Understanding the Problem
In Hibernate, SQL query generation can change between versions due to changes in how Hibernate handles type conversions. After upgrading to Hibernate 6, many users report encountering errors like:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with deeply nested arrays in Laravel, especially when handling configuration files, API responses, or multidimensional data structures, managing or accessing values quickly becomes complex. Laravel’s Arr::dot() method offers a clean, efficient way to flatten these arrays using “dot” notation, making them much easier to work with.
In this article, we’ll explore what Arr::dot() does, how it works, and when you might want to use it.
The Arr::dot() method in Laravel flattens a multidimensional array into a single-level array using dot notation for keys. This transformation allows you to access deeply nested values with a simple key string.
Arr::dot(array $array, string $prepend = '')
$prepend: (Optional) A string to prefix each key in the final array.
This method is part of Laravel’s Illuminate\Support\Arr helper class.
Let’s take a look at a typical example:
Input Array
$data = [

Applying Arr::dot()
$flattened = Arr::dot($data);
print_r($flattened);
[
    'user.name' => 'John',
1. Configuration Files
2. Localization
3. Form Handling
Bonus: Reversing the Flattening
$nested = Arr::undot($flattened);
Arr::dot() is a small but powerful utility in Laravel that simplifies the handling of complex arrays. Whether you're building APIs, working with config files, or cleaning up nested data structures, this helper can be a time-saver and make your code cleaner and more readable.
Next time you're faced with a deeply nested array, consider reaching for Arr::dot() — you’ll appreciate the simplicity it brings.]]></summary>

If you work with data, automate research, or build anything that involves gathering online information, web scraping is likely part of your workflow. The challenge is that scraping today’s websites is not as easy as it once was. The good news is that tools like Perplexity AI and Crawlbase can make your scraping stack more efficient, intelligent, and scalable.
In this post, I’ll walk you through how I use Perplexity AI for web scraping in Python and why combining it with Crawlbase’s scraping API has helped me build more powerful data pipelines.

Docker quietly builds a tiny virtual world behind the scenes — with bridges, fake Ethernet cables (veth), and routing tables. In this post, we'll walk through how Docker’s default bridge network actually works, using a diagram-based example. Ready? Let’s go! 👇
When you run:
docker run -d nginx

Docker places your container on a network called bridge (unless you tell it otherwise). This bridge is a virtual switch inside your host.
Your container:
Gets its own virtual Ethernet interface

Talks to other containers via the bridge
Reaches the outside world via NAT routing

  Historical and Technical Context


The emergence of web technologies has ushered in a new era of interactivity and real-time applications. However, with such capabilities comes the critical responsibility of user privacy and consent. The Permissions API was standardized as part of the broader movement to provide enhanced privacy practices on the web, enabling developers to manage user permissions more systematically.
The Permissions API was introduced to address the concerns posed by previous blind consent models, which often left users unaware of the degree of access they were granting. Traditionally, permissions like location access, notifications, and camera/microphone use were either all-or-nothing, l…]]></summary>

If you're experiencing slow load times with your current method—where each page requires a new HTTP request—you might want to consider converting your form into a Single Page Application (SPA). This approach enhances user experience by loading the HTML just once and using JavaScript to handle navigation smoothly.
Understanding the Issue
When using multiple pages for form registration, each time a user clicks the 'Next' button, a new HTTP request is sent to the server, which loads a new page. This results in a complete refresh, including reloading CSS, JavaScript, and images, leading to inefficient use of resources and slow loading speeds. A Single Page Application a…]]></summary>

So I went to https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird checked out the code and build it on WSL2 Windows 11, took around 3 hours to compile and finally it worked

UI looks similar to Firefox and feels like #Netscape in 1999, and it is developed actively, I hope we have a new and free browser because feels like Firefox is not that free anymore and Google has been too strong on browser market, it would be nice to have a real non-profit browser here. Maybe government/countries should support this kind of organizations otherwise browsers or OSes becoming like citizen monitoring tools and used for profit and manipulation, After we say internet is a human right that human should have the option of non monitored communication use in their home.
And in the YouTube video Andreas talks about SerenityOS which looks very similar to Windows 95, good old days. It is a good idea to have unix like OS as desktop. But remember this year is the Linux desktop year :D

In frontend development, engineers frequently face the decision of whether to build their own libraries or leverage existing open source solutions. While creating custom libraries can offer certain advantages, the modern development landscape increasingly favors using well-established open source libraries. This article examines both approaches to help teams make informed decisions.
Perfect Fit for Your Needs
Custom libraries can be designed specifically for your project's requirements
No unnecessary features or bloat that comes with generic solutions
Ability to make architectural decisions that align perfectly with your stack
No Dependency Risks

Como era meu primeiro projeto, cometi vários equívocos. Eu queria compartilhar alguns abaixo ⤵️ — e como eles estão me ajudando a evoluir:
🔥 Planejamento impulsivo  
Fui direto da ideia para a solução, sem mapear etapas ou prazos. Resultado? Retrabalho e ansiedade. Hoje, priorizo ferramentas de gerenciamento e cronogramas flexíveis para manter o foco sem engessar a criatividade. 
🔍 Validação superficial  
Criei o SaaS para resolver meu problema, mas não validei se era uma dor real do mercado. Consequência? Perdi tempo competindo com soluções já consolidadas. Aprendi que entrevistas com potenciais usuários são tão importantes quanto o código.
💸 Precificação "no feeling"  
Foquei em funcionalidades incríveis, mas não pensei em como monetizá-las de forma atraente. Lição? Agora estudo modelos de precificação antes de sair desenvolvendo novas features, usando cases de sucesso como referência.
✨ O saldo positivo?  
Esses tropeços me deram algo valioso: clareza. Hoje entendo melhor que errar faz parte do processo — desde que cada erro vire um degrau para iterar.
E você? Já passou por situações assim em seus projetos?]]></summary>

In this guide, we will focus on troubleshooting a case where one BLE device connects successfully while another fails to establish a connection even after initial setups seem correct. This situation can lead to frustration, especially if logs indicate that connections are attempted but not finalized. Let's explore some common reasons for this behaviour and how to address them effectively.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the DevOps landscape evolves, tracking the right KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) becomes more than a performance metric it becomes a strategy for continuous improvement, team alignment, and business value delivery.
In 2025, DevOps is not just about shipping code faster. It's about delivering resilient, scalable, and secure systems while maintaining harmony across development and operations.
Here’s a look at the most relevant KPIs DevOps teams should track in 2025 to ensure performance, productivity, and reliability are all on target.
Deployment Frequency
Why it matters: This KPI measures how often you deploy code to production. High-performing DevOps teams typically deploy multiple times per day.
How to improve:
•Automate CI/CD pipelines
•Embrace feature flags and trunk-based development
•Encourage smaller, incremental releases
Pro tip: Pair this metric with Change Failure Rate to ensure quality isn't sacrificed for speed.
Lead Time for Changes


Change Failure Rate (CFR)


Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)


System Uptime & Availability


Developer Productivity


Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Coverage


Security Scan Success Rate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey dev.to!
GAEB4Linux, which aims to bring native support for GAEB files (a German construction industry standard) to Linux.
GAEB is a widely used XML-based format for exchanging construction data in Germany. It’s essential for things like bills of quantities, tender submissions, costing, and invoicing.
There are plenty of GAEB software tools available, but almost all of them are Windows-only or commercial. Linux users in the construction industry currently have no solid open-source solution to handle GAEB files.
The goal is to create an open-source GAEB file viewer/editor for Linux (written in Java for cross-platform compatibility). The initial version will support:
Viewing GAEB XML files (e.g., .X83, .X84),


Entering bid data and prices for tenders,


Later stages could include additional features like full AVA (tendering and invoicing) functionality.




  
  
  🌱 Current Status:


Right now, I’m in the early planning phase – no code has been written yet. I’m designing the system, figuring out the core features, and planning how to integrate the GAEB XML structure.
Developers familiar with Java, XML, and GUI design (Swing/JavaFX, etc.),


Anyone with experience in the construction industry or knowledge of GAEB/AVA workflows,


Designers or UX/UI specialists who can help build an intuitive interface,


Feedback from anyone who has worked with GAEB or similar standards.



I’m planning to host the project on GitLab, and I’ll set up a chat (Discord/Matrix) for discussions and collaboration.
Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions, and I’m open to any tips from anyone who has experience with GAEB file handling.
Thanks for reading!

On one hand, you don't have to worry about complex locking mechanisms. On the other, you might stumble into weird issues where your code just... never runs. One such issue is starvation.
In the context of JavaScript, starvation refers to a situation where a task is perpetually delayed because the event loop is constantly busy with other tasks—usually of higher priority or those scheduled more frequently.
Since JavaScript executes code in a single-threaded environment using an event loop, starvation can occur when:
Long-running synchronous code blocks the event loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR:

LLMs are great, but they’re not your safety net. Please, for the love of all things holy, test your code. 
We’re in the golden age of vibe coding. LLMs scaffold our code, fix our syntax, and fill in the blanks. We’re thinking more about architecture and less about syntax—and that’s great.
But in all this abstraction, we sometimes skip something essential: testing.
AI doesn’t run your code. It doesn't know if that method exists, if that call will throw an error, or if that edge case breaks everything. It’s bluffing with confidence.
You can’t vibe your way through correctness. You need tests to know your code behaves the way you think it does.
🛡 Confidence to refactor without fear

🧠 Clarity around what your code is supposed to do

🔄 Continuity when you revisit the code 6 months later

🤝 Collaboration with teammates who now understand the logic
A mentor once told me:
“Start at the center—your happy case. Then go left, right, and fall off the line.”
Say your function expects a positive integer. Start with 42.
Then try:
0, -1, Infinity, -Infinity

A string ("hello"), a float (3.14), or null



Now take it further:
What if the parameters are undefined?
What if the database call fails?
What if the API returns malformed or missing data?
What if a field you depend on is null?
The real world is messy. Your tests should be ready for that.
As we stop writing every line ourselves, we need to start questioning every line more. AI will get you to “working”—but testing gets you to “works when it matters.”
AI bluffs. Don’t let it bluff you into a broken release.]]></summary>

In a May 2 filing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY), prosecutors released several impact statements from individuals affected by the collapse of Celsius filed after the initial deadline. Though at least one suggested clemency for the former CEO, many told the court about the financial and personal losses caused by the crypto firm filing for bankruptcy, and hinted that Mashinsky should be held accountable for misrepresenting the company.

Bitcoin is witnessing a tough battle between the bulls and the bears at the $95,000 level.

Solid buying by spot Bitcoin ETF investors last week signals a positive shift in investor sentiment. 

Select altcoins have held their support levels, increasing the likelihood of a short-term up move.

Bitcoin (BTC) slipped below the breakout level of $95,000 on May 4, indicating profit booking at higher levels. The bulls tried to push the price back above $95,000 on May 5 but are facing stiff resistance from the bears. 
Glassnode senior researcher CryptoVizArt said in a post on X that Bitcoin maintaining above $93,000 was very surprising and also risky as the rally to the $93,000 to $96,000 range “pushed the profit-taking volume above the statistical levels.” CryptoVizArt added that t…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grumphp es un orquestador que permite configurar el uso de herramientas de código estático para PHP.
Hasta hace relativamente poco tiempo he usado W4D como entorno de desarrollo en mis proyectos, pero hace un año me tocó probar Ddev para un proyecto y desde entonces me enamoré de todo lo que aporta este software.
Ahora toca migrar proyectos que tengo con W4D a Ddev y una de las cosas que toca migrar es Grumphp.
Para instalar Grumphp yo uso el paquete de Carcheky que está preparado para funcionar con Drupal y luego lo personalizo.
Ejecuto el siguiente código para instalar el paquete:
composer config extra.grumphp --json '{"config-default-path": "vendor/carcheky/drupal-grumphp/configs/grumphp.yml"}' ;
composer require --dev carcheky/drupal-grumphp -W

Una vez instalado copio el archivo grumphp.yml que se encuentra en 
vendor/carcheky/drupal-grumphp/configs/grumphp.yml a la misma altura del archivo composer.json
En el archvio composer.json busco la configuración de grumphp y actualizo config-default-path de la siguiente manera:
        "grumphp": {
            "config-default-path": "grumphp.yml"
        }

En el archivo grumphp.yml que hemos copiado a la raíz del proyecto buscamos la configuraciónde git_hook_variable y lo actualizamos de la siguiente manera:
  git_hook_variables:
    EXEC_GRUMPHP_COMMAND: ddev exec php

Por último en la consola ejecuto el siguiente comando para actualizar la configuración del hook pre-commit
ddev exec grumphp git:init

De esta forma actualizaremos el hook pre-commit de nuestro proyecto (los hooks pre-commit están en la ruta '/.git/hooks/pre-commit`y el archivo queda así:
`bash
DIFF=$(git -c diff.mnemonicprefix=false -c diff.noprefix=false --no-pager diff -r -p -m -M --full-index --no-color --staged | cat)
export GRUMPHP_GIT_WORKING_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
(cd "./" && printf "%s\n" "${DIFF}" | ddev exec php 'vendor/bin/grumphp' 'git:pre-commit' '--skip-success-output')

clicked.
This devblog is my honest take on helping you understand the Builder Pattern—the way I wish someone had explained it to me.
The Builder Pattern helps construct complex objects step by step.
In simple terms: You control the construction process, one method at a time.
You might be looking at a Builder Pattern if you see:
A class with many constructor parameters (some optional).
Code like:
IUser user = new User.Builder().setName("Alice").setAge(30).build();

A nested static Builder class or a separate builder class that returns the same object.
public class User implements IUser {

    private final int age;

The React compiler is one of the biggest updates to the React framework in years. Last year, the React team released a beta version. Around that time, I wrote an article called “Exploring React's Compiler: A Detailed Introduction”. 
It unpacked the core idea behind the compiler and showed how it could improve React development by automatically handling performance issues behind the scenes. When the beta dropped, the React team encouraged developers to try it out, give feedback, and contribute. And many did. A standout example is Sanity Studio. They used the compiler internally and shipped libraries like react-rx and @sanity/ui that are optimized for it.

  Chapter 5: Cross-Functional Teamwork Done Right


Being a product manager means wearing many hats, but it never means working alone.

The success of your product depends on how well you collaborate with designers, developers, QA, marketing, and more.
In this chapter, we’ll break down what cross-functional collaboration looks like when it’s done right and how you can foster it on your team.
Great PMs don’t just coordinate. They listen, learn, and empathize with every function.

Understanding the goals and constraints of each role builds trust and leads to better decisions.
Example:

Your designer is pushing back on adding another button to a crowded screen.

Instead of insisting, you ask about the visual hierarchy and UX implications.

Pick the wrong type, and you could end up with slow performance, skyrocketing costs, or an architecture that just doesn't scale.

def subtract(a, b):

Realtime apps (like chat, stock tickers, etc.) depend on live connectivity.
Offline-friendly experiences build trust and reliability.
It's surprisingly easy to implement.

Lets Wrap the entire app (or any major layout component) with AppShell:

navigator.onLine: Detects the initial connection status.
window.addEventListener("online"/"offline"): Reacts to changes in network status.
useEffect: Registers and cleans up event listeners when the component mounts/unmounts.
Let me know how you're handling offline states in your apps :)]]></summary>

If you're new to Angular and transitioning from server-side development, one common challenge is configuring your application to dynamically connect to your Spring REST API. While hardcoding URLs might be the simplest immediate solution, it often causes issues when deploying to different environments. In this article, we will discuss various approaches to effectively manage API URLs in your Angular application, ensuring a smooth deployment process.
Understanding API URL Management
When building applications that interconnect with REST APIs, it's crucial to manage API URLs efficiently. Typically, during development, you'd use one server endpoint (localhost), while production might require a completely different URL. Hardcoding API endpoints makes it challenging to adapt to thes…]]></summary>

88% of Bitcoin’s supply is in profit below $95,000, indicating a reset in investor expectations. 

The current price range of $75,000–$95,000 may represent a structural bottom, aligning with market conditions from Q3 2024.

The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio at 1.74 acts as a historical support zone, signaling cooling unrealized gains and potential for future growth.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) market dynamics are shifting, as Glassnode data reveals that 88% of the supply is currently in profit, with losses concentrated among buyers in the $95,000-$100,000 range. This high profitability, rebounding from a long-term mean of 75%, indicates a reset in investor expectations.

So, for the next couple of weeks, all of us started using dontpad — mostly just copy-pasting code, sharing it as soon as someone got it working. Whoever cracked the problem first would dump the code there, and the rest of us would just grab it and run.
Then one day, I was sitting in class and noticed how our teacher logged into her Gmail just to download a PPT and present it to the class. That moment stuck in my mind — but I got busy with other things and didn’t think much of it.

Data, in its simplest form, is raw, unprocessed facts and figures. It can be numbers, text, images, or any other form of information that can be stored and processed by computers.

In data science, splitting your dataset effectively is an important initial step towards building a robust model.

TypeScript is a robust, statically-typed programming language designed as a superset of JavaScript. Simply put, it enhances JavaScript by adding type definitions (a way to explicitly define the type of values) and other powerful features like interfaces, enums, and decorators. This makes it easier to work with larger codebases and prevent runtime errors by catching issues during the compile time. 
For those just starting out, think of TypeScript as a tool that adds structure and safety to JavaScript without changing its core nature. If you're building complex applications or working in a collaborative team, TypeScript helps make your code predictable, maintainable, and scalable.

Bitcoin has historically outperformed gold, more recently by sixfold.

Gold’s climb toward $5,000 could set the stage for significant Bitcoin gains.

Java compiler doesn't force exhaustiveness in switch statements, whereas switch expression are expected to be exhaustive. What really is exhaustiveness? Exhaustiveness ensures that all possible cases are handled in a switch expression, either explicitly or with a default case. For example, When you use an enum type, switch must cover different values of the enum. This is not limited to enums, its applicable to all the types switch supports. Look at the below versions of code, former one with switch statement and the later with switch expressions.

Slack's Developer Experience (DevXP) team recently implemented significant optimizations to their end-to-end (E2E) testing pipeline, achieving a 60% reduction in frontend build frequency and a 50% decrease in overall build time. These enhancements streamline the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process, allowing engineers to iterate rapidly and efficiently. 
Slack's existing repository utilizes a CI/CD pipeline that runs E2E tests prior to merging code into the main branch. This process validates changes across the entire application stack, including frontend, backend, and database. However, the team found that frontend builds occurred even when no frontend-related changes were made, leading to unnecessary long build times and resource consumptio…]]></summary>

Market manipulation is everywhere and yet nowhere to be seen. It is an invisible threat affecting crypto and traditional markets, leaving ordinary traders counting the costs. Sometimes, manipulation is obvious — illiquid tokens being pumped high before being dumped just as fast — but often, it's subtler and more challenging to detect.
What's more concerning is that these schemes are no longer the domain of rogue whales or amateur pump groups. Signs increasingly point to highly organized, well-funded networks coordinating activities across centralized exchanges, derivatives platforms, and onchain ecosystems. As these actors grow in sophistication, their threat to market integrity expands exponentially.

They can take user input, reason through goals, and interact with external services to complete real tasks. This makes them useful for building workflows, automation, and product features powered by language models.
To support this, OpenAI introduced the Agents SDK on March 11, 2025. The SDK provides a way to define agent behavior, connect to external tools, and manage the flow of actions. They ahve also extended the support for MCP recently. Tools are exposed through MCP (Model Context Protocol), a standard interface that lets agents discover and call functions from any compatible server.

Whether you're automating a deployment or writing a bash script to clean up temp files, there's one thing your future self will always thank you for: clear, timestamped, consistent logging.

Shell scripts often get the job done fast — but when they go wrong, debugging them can feel like trying to read hieroglyphics in the dark. Logging provides a flashlight. It tells you what ran, when it ran, and how it ran — especially when you're not watching.
This post walks you through a compact, reusable logger function for your shell scripts that:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ripple, the US-based crypto services firm behind the XRP Ledger, has committed $25 million in Ripple USD (RLUSD) to education nonprofits DonorsChoose and Teach For America.
According to a May 5 announcement, the grant will be processed through the crypto charity intermediary service The Giving Block. DonorsChoose CEO Alix Guerrier said "teachers are going the extra mile for their students' education, even spending hundreds — sometimes thousands — of dollars out-of-pocket for their classrooms." The donations are meant to provide teachers with resources for such initiatives.
Ripple cites a 2024 Gallup survey showing that 55% of US parents and adults are dissatisfied with the quality of K-12 education in the United States. This highlights “constraints and gaps in funding for education,” the reports reads. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse said in the statement:
“We hope to inspire others to do the same, starting with Teacher Appreciation Week, and leading into the rest of the year to support students and teachers with the resources they need to build a stronger future for themselves and their communities.”
Teach For America CEO Aneesh Sohoni said the new funding will allow the organization to expand its “Ignite Tutoring Fellows program, drive innovation in our Reinvention Lab, and provide crucial financial assistance” to prepare teachers.

Crypto-fueled charity
The cryptocurrency industry is familiar with charitable donations. Last month, Binance co-founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao pledged over half a million dollars worth of crypto to the earthquake disaster relief effort in Thailand and Myanmar. The Giving Block forecasts crypto donations to reach $2.5 billion in 2025.
Another player in the crypto charity field, Blockchain For Impact (BFI), in March committed $90 million to advance biomedical research.

Upgrading an application to .NET Core 3 often brings a variety of enhancements, one of which is the option to publish a single-file executable. While this has its advantages, many developers encounter path-related issues during the build process, particularly related to the PublishSingleFile flag. This article addresses a common problem where the executable path defaults to a temporary directory, disrupting access to vital resources.
Understanding the Issue
When you set the PublishSingleFile flag, the .NET runtime modifies how executable paths are resolved. Instead of locating the executable file in its original directory, it often redirects to a location like /var/tmp/.net/. This behavior occurs due to the way the runtime handles unpacking the single-file executable at runtim…]]></summary>

Checked Exceptions (compile-time exceptions)
Must be declared or handled (using try-catch or throws)
Examples: IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException




Unchecked Exceptions (runtime exceptions)
Not checked at compile time
Examples: NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException




Errors
Serious problems that applications should not try to catch
Examples: OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError






  
  
  Exception Handling Keywords




try: Block of code to monitor for exceptions
catch: Block that handles the exception
finally: Block that always executes (for cleanup)
throw: Used to explicitly throw an exception
throws: Declares exceptions that might be thrown by a method
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {

    System.out.println("This will always execute");
}

You can create your own exception classes by extending Exception (checked) or RuntimeException (unchecked):
class MyCustomException extends Exception {
    public MyCustomException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

Catch specific exceptions rather than general Exception
Don't ignore caught exceptions (empty catch blocks)
Use finally blocks for resource cleanup
Document exceptions with @throws in JavaDoc
Consider whether to handle, propagate, or convert exceptions
Would you like more details on any specific aspect of Java exceptions?]]></summary>

Happy revenge of the fifth! This week, I've been working with Python as I learn more about Machine Learning.

In one of the most bizarre crossovers between digital crime and real-world violence, a group of young cybercriminals stole almost $243 million in Bitcoin (BTC). Within weeks, the fallout spilled from the blockchain into a quiet Connecticut suburb, ending in a harrowing kidnapping plot.
If this seems like the plot of a Netflix thriller, you’re not alone in thinking that. But it happened. And fast.
Let’s unpack how a Minecraft-playing teenager, an underground network of crypto thieves and a Lamborghini-driving suburban couple all became tangled in a wild web of digital deception and real-world chaos.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you've worked with React or JavaScript modules, you might have noticed that sometimes you write imports with curly braces ({}) and sometimes without them. Ever wondered why?
Let’s break it down.
A default export allows a module to export a single value. It’s useful when your file exports just one main thing — like a component.
// components/Footer.jsx
export default function Footer() {
  return <footer>...</footer>;
}


import Footer from './components/Footer';


🚫 No curly braces needed for default exports.
A named export allows you to export multiple values from a file. You must import them using curly braces.
// components/Contact.tsx
export function Contact() { ... }
export function AnotherHelper() { ... }


import { Contact } from './components/Contact';


✅ Curly braces required for named exports.

You can combine both in one file:
export default function App() { ... }
export function Helper() { ... }


Then import like:
import App, { Helper } from './App';


Hope this clears up the mystery behind those curly braces!

Understanding the Warning
The warning signifies that some output was sent to the browser before your PHP script tried to refresh the session. This can often happen if there are unexpected characters or whitespace before the opening <?php tag or after the closing ?> tag in your PHP files.

MVC stands for Model View Controller, which is an abbreviation for model-view-controller. It is a widely applied software design paradigm. Its core idea is to organize the code by separating the business logic, data, and interface display, and centralize the business logic in one component. In this way, when improving and customizing the interface and user interaction, there is no need to rewrite the business logic. MVC has uniquely developed to map the traditional input, processing, and output functions into a logical graphical user interface structure.
MVC is a pattern for creating web applications using the MVC (Model View Controller model-view-controller) design. The specific introduction is as follows:

So, let me give you a little back story. The function I was testing is a a very simple one that check whether a user has permissions required to access given module or action. This function happened to use the JS array method called every
How every works is that it loops through the array and checks whether all items satisfy a provided condition. If it encounters any item that doesn’t it break the loop and returns false, however if all items satisfy the conditions then true is returned. However, there is a peculiar behavior to this method in that if an empty array is used then true is still returned. This is where the concept of vacuous truth comes in

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Michael Saylor’s Strategy, one of the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin investors, slowed its BTC purchases last week as the cryptocurrency briefly surged above $97,000.
Strategy acquired 1,895 Bitcoin (BTC) for $180.3 million during the week from April 28 to May 4 at an average price of $95,167 per BTC, the firm announced in its latest Form-8 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Strategy’s latest Bitcoin purchase is one of the smallest made by the company this year, alongside a comparatively meagre 130 BTC purchase in March.

The latest buy is 87% less than the previous purchase of 15,355 BTC announced last Monday.
Semler boosts buying despite rising prices
While Saylor’s Strategy cooled its Bitcoin buying spree last week, others upped their appetite for BTC.
Semler Scientific, a publicly traded US healthtech firm, bought 167 Bitcoin for $16.2 million in the period from April 30 to May 2 at an average purchase price of $97,093 BTC.
Announced on May 5, the purchase by Semler was up at least 50% from the previous 111 BTC purchase by the firm announced on April 25.

As of May 2, Semler held 3,634 BTC, acquired for an aggregate of $322.3 million at an average purchase price of $88,668 per BTC.
Semler’s Bitcoin holdings are considerably smaller than Strategy’s, which held 555,450 BTC as of May 4, acquired for $68,550 per BTC.
This is a developing story, and further information will be added as it becomes available.

On May 5, Zhao shared on X that he had advised Kyrgyzstan to start with Bitcoin (BTC) and BNB (BNB) when building its national crypto reserve. In 2024, Forbes claimed that Zhao holds about 94 million BNB tokens, or 64% of BNB’s circulating supply. At the time of writing, these tokens are worth about $55 billion. 
The proposal followed Zhao’s earlier announcement that he had begun advising Kyrgyzstan’s National Investment Agency (NIA) on blockchain and crypto-related matters.  
On April 3, Zhao confirmed he’s been officially and unofficially advising governments on crypto frameworks and blockchain solutions. The former Binance CEO said that he finds…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[database server is a server which uses a database application that provides database services to other computer programs or to computers, as defined by the client–server model.[citation needed][1][2] Database management systems (DBMSs) frequently provide database-server functionality, and some database management systems (such as MySQL) rely exclusively on the client–server model for database access (while others, like SQLite, are meant for use as an embedded database).
Users access a database server either through a "front end" running on the user's computer – which displays requested data – or through the "back end", which runs on the server and handles tasks such as data analysis and storage.
In a master–slave model, database master servers are central and primary locations of data while database slave servers are synchronized backups of the master acting as proxies.
Most database applications respond to a query language. Each database understands its query language and converts each submitted query to server-readable form and executes it to retrieve results.
Examples of proprietary database applications include Oracle, IBM Db2, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server. Examples of free software database applications include PostgreSQL; and under the GNU General Public Licence include Ingres and MySQL. Every server uses its own query logic and structure. The SQL (Structured Query Language) query language is more or less the same on all relational database applications.
For clarification, a database server is simply a server that maintains services related to clients via database applications.

Some say the big data craze has faded, while others lament the shrinking job opportunities, the increasing complexity of platforms, and the growing intricacy of business demands. But does this really mean big data is dying?
I don’t think so. In my view, what’s truly dying is not big data itself, but rather the outdated “dragon-slaying techniques” that no longer have any “dragons” to slay. The “dragon” has evolved, while our weapons remain stuck in the past. Technology needs to evolve, architectures need to be restructured, and capabilities need to be upgraded.
To understand the current state and trends of big data, we must first examine how it has evolved step by step. The development of big data can be divi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you're building a dynamic frontend—like a game store, product listing, or job board—your UI needs to handle a lot of state:
What page are we on?
What filters are selected?
Are we sorting by newest, most relevant, or trending?
What platform, genre, or tags are selected?
Managing all of that with separate useState hooks or deeply nested props can quickly become a nightmare. Enter the Query Object Pattern.
A Query Object is a single JavaScript object that encapsulates all your query parameters—filter values, sort order, pagination, etc.
const [query, setQuery] = useState({
  genreId: null,
  platformId: null,
  sortOrder: 'relevance',
  searchText: '',
  page: 1,
});

Instead of spreading your state across multiple hooks:

XRP forms a bearish descending triangle on the daily chart, risking a 45% drop to $1.20.

Declining daily active addresses signal reduced transaction activity and liquidity.

The XRP (XRP) price flashes warning signs as a bearish technical pattern emerges on its daily chart, coinciding with declining network activity. 
XRP descending triangle hints at 45% price drop
The XRP price chart has been forming a descending triangle pattern on its daily chart since its late 2024 rally, characterized by a flat support level and a downward-sloping resistance line.

1. Startup & Shutdown Times:
VMs generally take longer to start up and shut down compared to containers, which can impact the speed of deployment and scaling.
This delay can be a bottleneck in environments requiring rapid provisioning and de-provisioning of resources.
2. Dynamic Resource Allocation is Complex:
VMs rely on hypervisors(such as VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V) to manage and allocate resources like CPU, memory and storage. This adds complexity because the hypervisor needs to handle various resource demands and ensure fare distribution. (Earlier we would need to Shutdown the VM for changing the allocated resources but now this can be done on a running instance as well but it still needs input/human intervention and its complex)

In an interview at the Token20249 event in Dubai, Aptos’ head of ecosystem, Ash Pampati, told Cointelegraph that they see Web2.5 platforms earn “tons of revenue” within Aptos. He noted that consumer-focused applications in particular are thriving on the network.
Web2.5 is a term used to describe a combination of Web2 and Web3 technologies. The term describes platforms or applications that blend centralized Web2 experiences with decentralized Web3 elements. 
These applications often avoid full decentralization, drawing criticism for not fully embracing the Web3 vision.

But here's the key question:
How reliably is a message delivered from sender to receiver?
Let’s break down the three core delivery semantics you’ll encounter in real-world systems 👇
At-Most Once


🔹 Messages are delivered zero or one time
No retries, so if something fails — the message is lost
no guarantee of delivery
💡 Use case: Monitoring metrics, logs, or telemetry where occasional loss is acceptable.
At-Least Once


🔹 Messages are never lost
may be delivered multiple times
deduplicate on the consumer side
💡 Use case: Order processing, notifications, analytics — where duplicates can be filtered or ignored.
Exactly Once


🔹 Each message is delivered only once, no duplicates, no loss
very hard to implement
complexity, latency, and often performance trade-offs
💡 Use case: Financial transactions, trading systems, accounting — where idempotency is not supported and every operation must be precise.
Choosing the right delivery guarantee isn’t just about tech — it’s about your use case and business priorities.
a single duplicate message could cost thousands.
📌 Message Queue vs Event Streaming Platform?
🔹 Message Queues (like RabbitMQ, SQS): Focus on reliability and order for point-to-point communication.
🔹 Event Streaming Platforms (like Kafka, Pulsar): Optimized for broadcasting, storing, and replaying high-throughput event logs. Ideal for event-driven systems and real-time analytics.
What’s your go-to strategy for delivery semantics in distributed systems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let’s be honest. You've spent hours wrangling with bloated WordPress themes or waiting on backend fixes just to launch a simple page. Sound familiar?
It’s not you. It’s the traditional CMS model.
Let’s talk about why headless CMS is the quiet hero that’s helping frontend developers like you build faster and smarter.
What Is a Headless CMS (And Why Should You Care)?


In dev-speak: it’s a CMS without a front-end layer.
In real talk: it gives you content via API and lets you build the frontend however you want.
So instead of battling clunky plugins and rigid templates, you’re free to code with your favorite stack — React, Next.js, Vue, whatever.
1. Speed Boost with Modern Dev Tools


Headless CMS platforms are made to play well with modern JavaScript. You can:
Pull content via REST or GraphQL
Use static site generators like Next.js for blazing performance
Integrate easily with CI/CD workflows
Translation? You ship faster — and with less backend drama.
2. Frontend Freedom = Faster Iteration


No more begging backend devs to make a template change.
With headless, you’re in full control of the UI/UX. Want to test a new layout or animation? Go for it. Your content comes clean and structured — so you can design and iterate freely.
## 3. Better Dev-Content Team Workflow
They update copy. You build features. No blockers.
4. Scale Without Slowing Down


Need to serve content across web, mobile, and IoT? No problem.
You can scale globally, without rebuilding everything from scratch.
Final Thought: Headless Is Built for How Developers Actually Work
If you’re tired of waiting on legacy systems and want a faster, cleaner development experience, it might be time to switch.
Want to See It in Action?


Try a free headless CMS demo with Caisy.
It’s built with developers in mind — lightning-fast, API-driven, and perfect for JS frameworks.]]></summary>

Next.js - Image Component
Importing images used the 'import' keyword for the image 'src' breaks jest test #26749
Jest - Manual Mocks
React Testing Library
MDN JavaScript - Rest parameters
When testing a React component with Jest and the React Testing Library, this error occurs if the component renders a Next.js Image component and the Next.js Image component is not mocked.
Error: Uncaught [Error: Image with src "test-file-stub" is missing required "width" property.]

To allow passing dynamic properties into the mock image component so that it can handle different test cases, modify the mock image to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
In jest/setup.js, add the following:
jest.mock('next/image', () => ({
  __esModule: true,
  default: (props) => {
    return <img {...props} />;
  },
}));

For example,
const renderResult = render(<Header {...props} />);
container = renderResult.container;
console.debug(container.innerHTML);

This will output the following in the terminal:
<header class="main-header"><div class="container-h"><div class="main-header__top"><a class="main-header__logo-link" href="/"><img class="main-header__logo" src="test-file-stub" alt="test alt"></a><div class="main-header__top-right"><div class="main-header__dropdown-btns"></div></div></div><div class="main-header__bottom"><nav role="navigation">Mocked Nav</nav></div></div></header>]]></summary>

Creating PowerPoint presentations programmatically can streamline many tasks, but running into errors that impact your ability to open the formatted file can be frustrating. If you've been trying to create a .ppt file using Apache POI version 4.1.2 and encountered the error "PowerPoint found a problem with content in file.ppt", you're not alone. This issue, while not present during your work with previous versions like poi-3.17, indicates that there might be changes or compatibility issues in the newer version that we must address.
Why Does the Error Occur?
The error you’re experiencing typically arises due to changes in library behavior, certain configurations, or the way the Apache POI library handles PowerPoint file structures between versions. Potential issues could includ…]]></summary>

Developers are constantly tweaking prompts, adjusting tools, or changing logic. QA engineers are tasked with verifying that responses are accurate, relevant, and aligned with product expectations. Yet, most teams lack a structured way to experiment, compare, and improve AI agents across different versions.
This guide outlines the core challenges and introduces a solution based on isolating agent versions, logging structured evaluations, and making experimentation reproducible and measurable.

Then came Shadcn/ui, and for many developers like myself, it fundamentally changed the game.

Buterin’s thread came in response to a separate post by decentralized exchange Loopring founder and CEO Daniel Wang. Wang explained in his thread that the maturity of a system matters to its security:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Dev.to community! 👋
As a developer, I often found myself repeating the same Git commands over and over again during my workflow...

So I built a small CLI tool called gitNull to make that easier!
gitNull?


A lightweight GitFlow helper written in Node.js.

It automates common git actions like:
gitNull start-feature <name>
gitNull finish-feature <name>
gitNull push – adds, commits and pushes in one command
With a retro CLI look and some colorful feedback thanks to chalk and figlet.
I love clean workflows, and I always wished Git had something a bit more guided.

I didn’t want a full GUI — just a faster terminal flow.
This is my first attempt at building a CLI tool, and I'm sharing it to get feedback and ideas from the community.

Check it out on GitHub:

https://github.com/faithreborn/gitnull
Whether you're a CLI junkie, a GitFlow user, or someone who just hates typing long commands —

I’d really appreciate if you give it a try and tell me what you think. ❤️
Any feedback, issues or PRs are welcome!
Thanks for reading 🙌]]></summary>

It will store all the core info about each event: the account of the user who created it, the question text, creation time, expiration time, a flag that shows whether the event is closed, and the result.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using gRPC, one of its biggest advantages over traditional REST is the use of a single long-lived connection over HTTP/2.
What does that mean?


Unlike REST where every request opens a new connection, gRPC establishes one persistent connection between the client and the server. Through this connection, multiple messages can be exchanged — in both directions — without reopening it each time.
Think of it like this:


Imagine going to a restaurant. With REST, you’d have to enter and exit the restaurant every time you wanted to order something new. But with gRPC, you sit down once, and continue to place multiple orders and have conversations — all through that single session.
Benefits of gRPC’s Long-Lived Connection:



✅ Reduced latency
✅ Real-time communication
✅ Efficient use of resources
✅ Bidirectional streaming supported
Use Cases:


Perfect for real-time apps like online games, chat systems, IoT devices, and microservice communications — where speed and efficiency matter most.]]></summary>

The concept of sequence modeling is fundamental to understanding RNNs. Many real-world problems involve sequences, where the order of elements carries significant meaning. For example, in language, the meaning of a sentence depends heavily on the order of the words. Similarly, in video analysis, the sequence of frames determines the action being performed. RNNs excel at capturing these dependencies, making them a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. The application of RNNs is prevalent in the field of deep learning. 
The history of RNNs is marked by continuous evolution. Early RNN architectures faced challenges like the vanishing gradient problem, which hindered their ability to learn long-range dependencies. However, innovations like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) …]]></summary>

Why is this important? Because everyone learns differently. Some people understand pictures better, while others learn better by hearing or touching things. Synesthetic data interfaces help people understand hard things in their own way. And guess what? It’s not just for learning.

Laravel provides a robust validation system, but sometimes you may need to define custom validation rules to handle specific use cases. With Laravel 12, the process of creating custom validation rules has been streamlined with improved syntax and features.
In this article, we’ll explore how to create and use custom validation rules in Laravel 12.
While Laravel’s built-in validation rules cover most scenarios, there are cases where you need more flexibility. For example:
Validating a username to ensure it doesn’t contain special characters. 
Checking if a value exists in an external API.
Enforcing complex business logic.
Custom validation rules allow you to encapsulate this logic in a reusable and testable way.
In Laravel 12, you can create a custom …]]></summary>

Users often want their entire dataset to be visible, irrespective of the current zoom level. In this article, we will explore how to ensure all data points in your ECharts bar chart remain visible, even under various zoom settings.
Understanding ECharts and Zooming
ECharts is a powerful open-source charting library that enables developers to create interactive charts effortlessly. Bar charts (like the one in your example) are especially useful for comparing different categories of data. However, when zooming in on a chart, some data points can fall outside of the visible area due to the scaling of the axes or the chart dimension limitations.

The main usage of @puya/fh is helping in syncing content of a folder based on its differences with another folder, no matter where they are located (same machine or different machines).
The tool does not perform the sync job itself when the two folders are located in separate machines. It provides features though that helps in creating a changeset out of the changes.

During Token2049 in Dubai, Notcoin co-founders Sasha and Vladimir Plotvinov, along with Uliana Salo, the head of design and product lead for NotGames, spoke with Cointelegraph about the state of Telegram-based Web3 gaming. 
Vladimir told Cointelegraph that game builders are shifting to different genres as tap-to-earn has failed to sustain players’ interests. 
“We’re going to see different types of games, as tap-to-earn games are probably dead because they’re not sustainable,” he said.

A digital twin is a virtual model or replica of a physical object, system or process. It’s like a digital mirror, allowing us to simulate, monitor and predict the behavior of real-world entities in real-time. 
These virtual counterparts are designed to pull data from physical sensors or inputs, providing a continuous feedback loop that helps with analysis, optimization and decision-making. Digital twins can represent almost anything, from machinery in a manufacturing plant to human behavior or entire cities.
In industries like healthcare, automotive, manufacturing and urban planning, digital twins allow for better resource management, predictive maintenance and more accurate simulations before physical changes are made. In e…]]></summary>

When working with Angular applications, encountering errors can often perplex even the most seasoned developers. One common error is the TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'offsetHeight'). This blog post will address what causes this error and how you can resolve it seamlessly.
Understanding the Error
The error in question occurs when you attempt to access a property of an object that is null. In the context of your Angular application, this is often related to scenarios where components or services have not initialized correctly or are not available during the lifecycle of the application. Specifically, in your case, it happens when the MenuModule from PrimeNG tries to perform layout calculations on a menu element that hasn't been fully rendered yet.

This article explores RBAC and LBAC in Grafana, highlighting real-world best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and actionable insights to scale efficiently.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) assigns permissions based on defined roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), controlling user actions like dashboard creation or data source management. RBAC excels in simplicity, making it ideal for straightforward access needs in small, single-tenant setups.
Pros:
Easy to implement
Well-understood by engineers
Cons:
Quickly becomes unmanageable at scale
Limited granularity, causing "role explosion" in complex scenarios
LBAC enhances access control by dynamically filtering data based on labels or attributes at query-time, rather than just static user roles. Grafana recently introd…]]></summary>

When you write Python code, you use symbols to separate, group, or define parts of the program. These symbols are called delimiters. A delimiter does not perform an action like an operator. Instead, it marks structure and boundaries.
In writing, you use punctuation to make ideas clear. A comma breaks up items. A period ends a sentence. In Python, delimiters help the interpreter make sense of what comes next.
Python uses delimiters to shape the structure of your code.
(1 + 2) * 3

{"key": "value"}
x = 7

You use delimiters to build lists, assign values, pass arguments, and group code. Python requires these markers so it can read your program correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[State management is a critical part of building modern front-end applications. If you've worked with Vue 2, you may be familiar with Vuex. But with Vue 3, a new, simpler alternative has emerged: Pinia.
In this article, you’ll learn how to use Pinia to manage application state in a Vue 3 project — from installation to real-world usage.
Enjoy!
Pinia is the official state management library for Vue 3. It’s lightweight, modular, and built with the Composition API in mind. Compared to Vuex, it offers a simpler syntax, better TypeScript support, and out-of-the-box devtools integration.
Benefits of using Pinia:
Simpler syntax compared to Vuex
First-class support for the Composition API
Built-in devtools and TypeScript support
Modular design (define as many small stores as needed)

I built a Web3-based CMS (Content Management System) designed for managing decentralized content like collections, banners, presale campaigns, and other on-chain/off-chain data. The CMS provides an admin dashboard where team members can log in using their crypto wallets and manage the platform’s content in a more structured and user-friendly way.
The key problem it solves is the lack of permission control in many Web3 tools. Typically, dApps allow wallet login but don’t differentiate between users. In my CMS, I introduced fine-grained access control so that different roles (e.g., admin, content editor, viewer/analyst) have access only to the features relevant to them.

Many developers find themselves in a situation where they need to assign classifications to items in a large dataset based on certain criteria. In this article, we will explore a straightforward way to replace names with their corresponding categories, such as 'Soccer player', 'MMA fighter', 'NBA player', and 'NFL player', using Python.
Understanding the Problem
In our example, we have a CSV file containing various names representing athletes from different sports. Our objective is to replace those names with predefined categories without having to manually assign each one. This approach not only saves time but also reduces the likelihood of errors that might occur with manual data entry.

Hi all.
I recently rebuilt my personal site using 11ty, and I wanted to share a bit about why I chose simplicity over flashy design.
Like many developers, I started with a more complex stack — Astro, React, lots of moving parts. It looked cool, but it started to feel like I was building for the tools instead of myself.
So I started over with 11ty. It’s fast, flexible, and just lets me focus on content. Tbh I hate npm, and with 11ty i like that there's no bundlers, no frameworks. Just clean HTML, Markdown, and a bit of templating.
The site is still a work in progress, but I like how it feels now — more personal, less performative. It’s a place for my notes, thoughts, and projects. Nothing fancy. Just mine.
Would love any feedback or thoughts — especially from others who’ve simplified their stacks or gone the “digital garden” route.
Thanks for reading!]]></summary>

As frontend developers, understanding modern authentication flows and how to implement them securely is crucial. This article explores the most widely used authentication methods today: OAuth 2.0, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and OpenID Connect, and introduces some emerging approaches.
Authentication determines who the user is, and authorization determines what they can access. An insecure authentication mechanism can expose your app to session hijacking, data leaks, and impersonation attacks.
Modern SPAs (Single Page Applications) demand decoupled and secure authentication techniques that work well across multiple clients, including web, mobile, and APIs.

If you're developing a Tauri app and want to customize the hover text that appears when your application is minimized to the dock, you're in the right place! The hover text, also known as the tooltip, often defaults to the app name specified in your configuration file. In this guide, we'll explore how to change the hover text to reflect your specific preferences, such as setting it to 'Pepper', the name of your app.
Why Hover Text Matters
Hover text or tooltips provide users with quick information about what an application does. In the context of a Tauri app on the dock, having clear and informative hover text can improve user experience and provide clarity regarding the app’s purpose. It eliminates ambiguity, especially for apps with similar names or purposes.

When working with SQL, especially with outer joins, it's crucial to understand how to filter your results effectively. In your case, you're looking to perform a right outer join between two tables and then conditionally include or exclude rows based on the status from one of these tables. This article will break down how to efficiently filter results using outer joins in SQL while ensuring you get data according to specific conditions.
Understanding the Outer Join Behavior
Outer joins, particularly the right outer join you mentioned, are designed to include all the entries from the right table (in this case, table2), along with matching rows from the left table (table1). If there are no matches, SQL will return NULL for columns from table1. This behavior poses a challenge when…]]></summary>

Let’s face it: no system is invincible. 
Linux security is all about keeping your system safe from unauthorized access, data breaches, and cyber threats-using smart design, open-source transparency, and a community that’s always on the lookout. 
The best part? You’re in control.



Permissions are the backbone of Linux security.

If you're looking to create a PHP script that dynamically reads permissions from a text file and assigns them to variables, you're in the right place! In this guide, we'll walk through a solution that accomplishes this by utilizing plain text files for configurations, allowing an easy setup for your template. You'll learn how to handle permissions, and variable assignment based on the contents of your file.
Understanding the Configuration File
The main file we will be reading from is Administrator.txt. This file contains various configurations listing the permissions. Each permission is either just a line with the permission name or a line formatted as permission_name: value; that assigns a power value. Here’s what our Administrator.txt file looks like:

Yes, I account for this because sometimes it doesn't matter how much time ahead I pack there is usually something I missed packing and have to either bother a relative to let me borrow it.
I don't love forgetting stuff but at this point I rather forget than having to change my ways, like packing weeks before like my mother does. Smart lady, never forgets anything. I'm more like my dad in these type of things. 'Men'.
I'm not sure if it's a fair thing to asume, 'all men are bad at packing' but I tell you, there is a pattern. My male cousin, doesn't travel, I wonder if he would also suck at packing. I think having a comfortable amount of money makes you care less because you can just purchase what you forget at the place where you go to maybe, – saying this in the most possibly humble way. For example, I forgot to pack belts, now I have to go to a store and buy something I already had for free at home.]]></summary>

Let’s say you’re building an app with several moving parts—maybe one service processes user signups, another sends welcome emails, and another tracks analytics.

Messaging and event-driven architecture solve this by letting each part send and receive information independently. It works like this:

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and every subsequent number is derived from the sum of the two previous numbers. A brief look at the series reveals:
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
This characteristic property makes it a popularly studied sequence in both mathematics and pr…]]></summary>

My Journey

Using Permit.io for Authorization
I built AuthClinic, a comprehensive healthcare platform that revolutionizes how medical data access is managed. This isn't just another healthcare app—it’s a carefully crafted solution that addresses one of the most critical challenges in healthcare: secure and flexible data access control.
The platform allows healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers to manage medical records, health plans, and sensitive information with unprecedented precision. What sets it apart is its sophisticated permission system that understands the complex relationships in healthcare—from family members to professional caregivers, and everything in between.

You ever stare at your GitHub contribution graph like it's a Tamagotchi you forgot to feed?
Yeah, me too.
So I built something unholy:

A Bash-based automation daemon that ensures your GitHub profile always looks... alive.

It commits. It pushes. It even wakes your computer from the dead to do it.
⏰ Schedules fake-but-believable commits at randomized human hours

🔁 Retries if GitHub rejects your offering

💾 Logs your ritual attempts and successes

🌴 Vacation mode, so your ritual pauses when you need rest (or alibis)

🔥 Self-healing if a ritual was missed (triggered by guilt and grep)

👁️ macOS popup warnings like:
> “⚠️ No ritual detected today. The square is empty. You are exposed.”
🧙 Choose your commit incantations like:


feat: added function nobody asked for
fix: removed existential crisis from variable name
📜 Add custom altar messages


🔓 Unlock rare achievements like:


"100 Days of Devotion"
"The Sacred Streak"
✅ Daily ritual cron + safety check daemon

🪞 GitHub visibility flip (goes public, commits, hides again)

🧙‍♀️ Bash installer with prompt-based setup

🏕️ Vacation flag toggle for burnout mercy

🧾 .command launcher for double-click ritualism

🎨 Coming Soon:


SVG badges

GitHub profile theme pack


Guilt Daemon™ (shames you in Slack when your squares go dark)
Yes.
I built it for fun. I also use it daily.

It’s part spiritual theater, part productivity placebo, and part real automation.
Bash
cron, pmset, at, and osascript (macOS)
GitHub CLI (gh)
Dark magic
I'm testing the waters. If enough devs want this, I’ll clean it up, ship a proper version, maybe even add a front-end GUI (Tauri? React? Electron? We’ll see).
Leave a comment if you'd actually use it — or just want the GitHub link.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is going to be a quick Devlog, because I just want to get back to this issue I'm having and figure out a solution for it. I've gone back to the drawing board, trying to figure out how to effectively unwrap the donut-shaped Voronoi diagram I have for my river tiles. I think this is the third week I've been working on the same problem now, so I'm getting a little frustrated because 3 weeks is a lot of time that could have been spent working on some other part of the game.
I just feel like when I do solve this, one - I won't have to think about it again, and two - the visual pay-off will have been worth it. I also feel like I've invested too much time to not get some kind of pay-off for this feature.
The biggest issue that I'm having is that when I have the shapes aligned as they leave one of the corner tiles and enter the straight tile, by the time they flow along the straight path in time to reach the bottom, they're not quite aligned.
Now I think the problem I'm having is that I've got a slight overlap on the tiles, the row beneath covers the row above by a couple of pixels - enough to make the borders around the tiles match up. This looks fine in practice, but I need to compensate for that when aligning the shapes, and I feel like this is throwing a spanner in the works.
So, I'm redoing my hex grid, and I'm using this article as a reference...

I'm going to try and math my way through this tonight. Wish me luck!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This article will introduce how to quickly import csv or txt files larger than 1g into the database.
Here, we prepared a CSV file with 10 million rows x 30 columns x 4GB. At first, I tried to import it with Navicat.
The first problem I encountered was that the encoding format was unknown, which led to many attempts to find the correct encoding.
The second problem is that Navicat reads and writes one by one. Although this does not take up memory, the speed is very slow.
The third problem is that halfway through the import, an error was reported because the field length was not enough! ! ! I had to reset the field length and import from 0 again. . . What's worse is that after setting one field, another error was reported. . .
Now, we use the DiLu Converter Import tool to solve these problems one by one.

Encoding: It can be automatically identified by default (for files with unknown encoding). If the encoding format of the file is known, you can select or enter its encoding format to speed up the parsing speed.
Chunk Size: You can set the number of rows to import at a time according to the available memory of your computer. My computer has a total of 16G memory, about 9G is available, and 500,000 is set in a batch. Here, you must set the size according to the available memory. If the setting is too large, the memory may overflow, and if the setting is too small, it will not speed up.
And The just click start
You can see that it takes about 20 seconds to import a batch of 500,000 rows, and the memory usage is less than 1G
Finally, it took about 5 minutes to import this csv file of 10 million rows x 30 columns x 4GB, and the maximum memory usage was about 1G. Because the tool imports files in batches according to batch size, no matter it is 1 file or hundreds or thousands of files, no matter a single file is 1G or 100G, as long as the batch size is set reasonably, it can be imported quickly, stably and without consuming memory.]]></summary>

We’ll investigate why the Rust compiler requires explicit type annotations in certain situations and provide a step-by-step solution to this common problem.
Why Does Rust Require Explicit Type Annotation?
Rust is a statically typed language, which means types are known at compile time. When you define a generic structure, the compiler often needs to understand what specific type to use for the generics. In your code example, you're trying to instantiate C without specifying its type, which results in the following error:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’ve ever played with dominoes, you know that the order of the numbers doesn’t matter—[1,2] is the same as [2,1]. That's the central idea behind this popular LeetCode problem:
💡 Given a list of dominoes, return how many pairs of dominoes are equivalent. Two dominoes [a, b] and [c, d] are equivalent if:
(a == c and b == d) or
(a == d and b == c)
Let's dive into the most optimal way to solve this!
Instead of comparing every pair (which would take O(n²) time), we can:
Normalize each domino: [a, b] becomes [min(a, b), max(a, b)]

Use a hash map to count how many times each normalized domino appears.
Every time we see a duplicate, we count how many previous identical dominoes we've seen.
Add that count to the result (because every new domino can pair with all previous identical ones).

This guide breaks down actionable strategies to optimize indexing, querying, and shard management for improved performance and cluster health.
Index: A logical namespace that maps to one or more physical shards.
Shard: A basic unit of storage and search in OpenSearch. Each shard is a Lucene index.
Performance is tightly tied to how indices and shards are structured, distributed, and queried.
Too many shards create overhead; too few limit concurrency. Aim for ideal shard sizes between 10–50 GB.
Avoid the default 5 shards unless justified.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Desde su popularización alrededor de 2011, la arquitectura de microservicios ha generado gran interés tanto por su concepción teórica como por su aplicación práctica. La promesa de descomponer sistemas complejos en unidades independientes, facilitando despliegues ágiles, escalabilidad granular, monitoreo detallado y desarrollo autónomo, impulsa de manera significativa la eficiencia en las distintas etapas del ciclo de vida del software. No obstante, ante este conjunto de beneficios, la adopción de esta arquitectura en cualquier proyecto puede resultar riesgosa si no se aborda con una comprensión profunda de las mejores prácticas. Una arquitectura de microservicios mal diseñada puede fácilmente igualar, o incluso superar en complejidad y dificultades, a un sistema monolítico tradicional.

When developing a Rust application, using environment variables can streamline configurations and various setups. However, if you encounter the error 'LOG_FILE must be set' while trying to log messages from your application, it might indicate that your application isn't reading the .env file correctly. Let's delve into how to resolve this issue so that your Rust application can access the LOG_FILE variable seamlessly.
Understanding the Issue
The error thread 'main' panicked at 'LOG_FILE must be set: NotPresent' signifies that the program attempted to retrieve the LOG_FILE environment variable but could not find it. This usually happens for a couple of reasons:
The .env file is not being loaded properly.
The environment variable is incorrectly specified or is missing.

Let’s be honest — most software engineering interviews suck.
They’re filled with algorithmic trivia, abstract whiteboarding, and awkward “culture fit” questions that have nothing to do with the actual job. The result? Interviews that waste time for everyone and still fail to identify great engineers.
This blog is for both interviewers and interviewees — whether you’re designing a hiring process or preparing for one. The goal is to make interviews practical, time-efficient, and focused on what truly matters: real-world engineering skills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally posted on May 2, 2025
After a major setback wiped our codebase, we rebuilt Tavrn's 1-to-1 DM system from scratch — in just 3 days. This post breaks down how we did it, what’s new, and why it’s already better than before.
After losing our original codebase, we had two choices:

Start over slowly and mourn the loss...

Or hit the ground running and build something better.
We chose the second one.
It only took 3 days — but our 1-to-1 messaging system is back.

Fully rebuilt from the ground up. Clean. Fast. Future-proof.

And, honestly? It’s better than what we had before.
We redesigned how messages move, how conversations flow, and how it all scales.

What used to feel basic now feels tight — like something you’ll actually want to use every day.
Here’s a little peek at what’s already working in our new DM system:
🔒 Fast messaging with improved delivery speeds

🌙 Sleeker UI built with clarity and vibe in mind

🗂️ Better message rendering
💬 Typing indicators and presence detection, redone the right way

⚡️ A system that can grow without getting messy



And we’re just getting started.
Now that DMs are locked in, we’re moving on to polish other core features — including group chats, profiles, and real-time updates.
Every step is built with community, performance, and personality in mind.

No bloat. No noise. Just smooth, satisfying conversation.
Setbacks happen. But we’re proud of how we responded:

By building. By improving. By actually shipping something better.
If you’ve been waiting on Tavrn — thank you.

The foundation is back. And the future’s right behind it.
— Tavrn]]></summary>

Gone are the days when shopping was nothing more than exchanging goods for currency. Today, beneath the familiar surface of the high street and online storefronts, an intricate interplay of data-driven intelligence and personalised precision shapes the retail landscape.
At the epicentre of this quiet upheaval is Artificial Intelligence (AI). Not a futuristic novelty from distant sci-fi narratives, but a living, evolving presence within retail operations worldwide. By 2025, AI’s role in retail is forecasted to be valued at an astounding £54.92 billion.

We needed structure, not just good intentions.

People came prepared. Decisions were made faster.
But here's the thing - it's not just about having an agenda.
It's about crafting one that guides the conversation without stifling creativity.
We found a balance between structure and flexibility with Rally.

Linux gives me a better command line, simpler software installation, and runs lighter on my hardware. I especially love how it matches most production servers, making deployment way less headache-inducing.
That said, Windows isn't the villain some developers make it out to be. It plays nicer with commercial software, gaming tools, and corporate systems. Windows users now have a solid option with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), letting you run Linux tools right inside Windows - giving you the best of both worlds without the commitment of switching entirely.
Ultimately, great developers build amazing stuff on all systems. Your OS is just one piece of your toolkit, not the defining factor of your skills. My switch to Linux boosted my workflow for web and backend projects, but I know plenty of rockstar devs crushing it on Windows and Mac.

Understanding the Comparison in Kotlin
Kotlin has a distinct approach to equality compared to Java. In Kotlin, the == operator is actually syntactic sugar for the equals() method. Thus, when you write if (jobExecution.exitStatus == ExitStatus.COMPLETED), Kotlin attempts to call equals() on the jobExecution.exitStatus.  However, if Kotlin does not recognize ExitStatus as having a valid equals method that matches the expected types, you will receive the compilation error: No method 'equals(Any?): Boolean' av…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I started working on SafePlate AI because I wanted to help a loved one who was struggling with food allergies, hoping to make their daily life a little easier. Managing food allergies and dietary restrictions can be frustrating and time-consuming, especially when you want to make sure every meal is safe and fits your nutrition goals. I realized there wasn’t a simple tool that could help me quickly identify safe foods and suggest meals tailored to my needs. So, as a good developer, I decided to build one myself.
In this post, I want to share on of the feature that I added to the product: how to programmatically post to Facebook after a recipe is created.
The project is built using Google Cloud Platform, Ionic (Angular), NestJS and Vertex AI.
Here is the flow where all the magic happens:

Why Traditional Permissions Fall Short


What Are ACLs and When to Use Them


Basic ACL Commands: getfacl and setfacl


Real-World Examples


Removing and Managing ACLs


Best Practices

Summary
In Linux, we usually use chmod and chown to manage file permissions. That works well when you just need to give access to one user and one group. But what if you need to give access to multiple users or different groups on the same file?
That's where ACLs (Access Control Lists) come in. They allow you to control file access in a much more detailed way.
Standard permissions only allow:
One owner (user)
One group
Let’s say you want to:
Give read-only access to one user
Allow full access to another user
And block a group from accessing the file
You can’t do this wi…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
If you've found yourself wondering why the AWS CLI ignores --include options when you run a complex command through a Bash script, you're not alone. Many users experience unexpected behavior when executing AWS S3 commands, especially when utilizing recursive downloads along with --exclude and --include flags. Understanding how these flags work together in the context of Bash scripts can be crucial for achieving the desired results without unnecessary downloads.
Understanding the Issue
The primary cause of the problem you're encountering is how the Bash script is interpreting the command instructions. When we involve special characters, spacing, and quotes in Bash, it’s easy for commands to be parsed incorrectly compared to when they’re executed directly in the terminal.

Qwen 3, the latest iteration of Alibaba Cloud's Qwen series, is a state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) designed for advanced natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation, code completion, and multi-modal reasoning. Its hardware requirements depend on the specific use case (training vs. inference), model size (e.g., parameter count), and deployment environment (cloud vs. on-premise). This report outlines the necessary hardware specifications for various scenarios.
  Parameter Count: Qwen 3 is expected to scale from 7 billion (7B) to 100+ billion (100B+) parameters, with potential variants like Qwen 3-7B, Qwen 3-72B, and Qwen 3-100B. Larger models require more memory and computational power.

git init: Starting a New Project from Scratch
When you're beginning a new project and want to put it under version control, git init is the command you'll use. This command creates a new Git repository in your project directory, initializing it with a hidden .git folder that tracks changes to your code.

The most subtle bugs aren't in the code you write - they're in the code you approve without enough context.
This is a short story about a seemingly harmless line in a PR that I reviewed - and how it taught me to slow down, even with small changes.
The line of code below,
if(!user.isVerified) return;

intention behind this was good not to allow unverified users to proceed into the app.
But this return statement wasn't part of larger flow. It was inside a route guard - and it exited silently, without a redirect, message or error.
User who signed up with Google or Github (OAuth) were marked isVerified=false
This line caused the app to fail to load the protected dashboard, but displayed no error
The app just failed silently with blank screen to user.
A fallback route with clear message was added and tested both social and email/password flows going forward.
if(!user.isVerified) {
    this.route.navigate(['/verify-email']);
    return;
}

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the fast-paced world of software development, Quality Assurance (QA) Testers are the unsung heroes ensuring that what we build actually works — and works well. They test end to end to ensure the products meet its requirement and specification. They look for loopholes, and prevent bugs in production.
Here’s why QA is essential:
✅ Bug Prevention, Not Just Detection: QA testers help catch issues early, saving time and resources before bugs make it to production.
✅ Improved User Experience: They think like end users, helping to ensure a smooth, intuitive experience.
✅ Boosts Developer Efficiency: Engineers can focus on building, knowing QA has their back on quality.
✅ Confidence to Ship: With QA sign-off, teams can deploy with peace of mind.
✅ Maintains Brand Reputation: High-quality, reliable software keeps users happy and loyal.
A great QA Tester doesn’t just test — they collaborate, communicate, and elevate the whole team.
Let’s stop thinking of QA as the last step, and instead, an integral part of the process from Day One. 💡]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Com o crescimento das ferramentas de inteligência artificial (IA) como ChatGPT, Gemini e DeepSeek, muitos usuários buscam maneiras de otimizar suas interações para obter respostas mais precisas e relevantes. Uma estratégia eficaz é organizar as conversas por temas ou especialidades. Essa abordagem não apenas mantém o contexto claro, mas também reduz erros e mal-entendidos.
🎯 Por que Organizar as Conversas por Tema?
Manutenção do Contexto: Ao separar as conversas por tópicos específicos, a IA pode entender melhor o assunto em questão, proporcionando respostas mais alinhadas às suas necessidades.
Histórico Claro: Ter conversas distintas para cada tema facilita a revisão de informações anteriores, permitindo que você retome discussões passadas sem confusão.
Redução de Erros: Misturar assuntos em uma única conversa pode levar a respostas imprecisas. Ao manter tópicos separados, você minimiza esse risco.
🛠️ Dicas para Organizar Suas Conversas
Crie Títulos Específicos: Nomeie cada conversa com um título que reflita claramente o tema abordado, como “Dicas de UX/UI” ou “Aprendizado de Python”.
Utilize Etiquetas ou Pastas: Se a plataforma permitir, categorize suas conversas em pastas ou com etiquetas para facilitar o acesso futuro.
Inicie com um Contexto Claro: Ao começar uma nova conversa, forneça informações detalhadas sobre o que você espera da IA, incluindo objetivos e restrições.
📈 Benefícios a Longo Prazo
Adotar essa abordagem estruturada não apenas melhora a qualidade das respostas, mas também transforma a IA em uma ferramenta mais eficaz para aprendizado e trabalho. Com conversas bem organizadas, você economiza tempo, evita retrabalho e maximiza o potencial das ferramentas de IA.
Organizar suas interações com inteligências artificiais por temas ou especialidades é uma prática simples, mas poderosa. Ao implementar essa estratégia, você garante conversas mais produtivas, claras e eficientes, aproveitando ao máximo o que essas ferramentas têm a oferecer.]]></summary>

echo vs print: An Overview


Both echo and print are language constructs in PHP that are used to output data to the screen. While they may seem interchangeable, there are subtle differences:
Syntax and Efficiency: 
echo can accept multiple parameters, whereas print can only take one argument.
echo is slightly faster as it doesn’t return any value, allowing for better performance in large-scale applications.
Return Values: 
echo does not return any value.

No visibility. No logic. No composability.

As a senior developer immersed in AI technologies, I've witnessed firsthand how fellow developers are leveraging these tools to build lucrative side hustles. 
The AI market is experiencing explosive growth, with recent studies showing that 87% of executives report skills gaps in their workforce-particularly in AI expertise. This talent shortage has created a perfect environment for developers to monetize their AI skills, with many earning anywhere from $1,000 to $10,000 monthly through various side projects. Something like that.
As of May 2025, several key trends dominate the AI side hustle space:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In programming, passing parameters to functions is crucial for manipulating data effectively. Java, unlike some languages such as C#, does not support reference parameters in the same way. Instead, Java uses pass-by-value semantics, which means that when you pass a variable to a method, a copy of that variable is sent. However, there are ways to achieve similar functionality using mutable objects or wrapper classes. In this article, we'll explore how to simulate reference-like behavior in Java using simple examples and provide a clear understanding of handling output parameters in functions.

1 INTRODUÇÃO
Hoje em dia, com quase tudo conectado à internet, a segurança dos sistemas de software virou uma grande preocupação. Ataques e acessos indevidos podem acontecer a qualquer momento, e por isso é tão importante que os sistemas já sejam pensados para se proteger desde o começo.
Quando se fala em segurança, fala-se da proteção dos dados e do bom funcionamento do sistema em geral, mesmo diante de possíveis ameaças. Isso é ainda mais importante em áreas como os sistemas do governo, ecommerce ou qualquer serviço que lida com informações sensíveis e confidenciais. Ou seja, desenvolver sistemas usando técnicas seguras é algo essencial para garantir confiança e evitar prejuízos em todos os aspectos.

So let’s break it down.
Understanding JSON Marshaling in Go
In Go, the encoding/json package is typically used to encode and decode JSON. In your example, b, _ := json.Marshal(output) marshals the output variable into a JSON byte slice b. The underscore _ is used to ignore any errors that may occur during marshaling. This is often a pattern when we are confident that there won't be an error or we want to handle it later.

This issue often arises from the way matrices—specifically the view-projection matrix—are combined when rendering a scene. In your code, you mention that the screen position moves in the opposite direction when you rotate the camera. Let's delve deeper into why this might be happening and how we can fix it effectively.
Understanding the Problem
In your code, you set up the view and projection matrices and then combine them to create a view-projection matrix. However, if the view matrix isn't correctly set up to reflect the camera's orientation, the resulting transformations can appear inverted or mirrored. To ensure proper functiona…]]></summary>

In any software project, every small change made to the codebase is recorded in Git history. This history is not just a log of what happened — it's a crucial tool for tracking changes, collaborating with others, managing releases, and automating development workflows.
It becomes hard to understand why a change was made
Generating changelogs becomes manual and time-consuming
CI/CD tools can’t effectively leverage the commit history
And in team environments, others struggle to follow your changes
This is where Conventional Commits come into play. It’s a simple but powerful convention that allows us to write commit messages in a structured, readable, and machine-parsable way — making life easier for both developers and tools.

        <updated>2025-05-04T18:09:12.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently in enterprise development, I came across a requirement to adjust and optimize a scheduled email-sending task. While the logic itself was straightforward, the debugging experience was not.
Here's what made it tricky:
The development environment lacks a unified interface to manually trigger backend @Scheduled tasks from the frontend.
Debugging by modifying the cron expression means:


Restarting the entire project every time
Risking a flood of unintended emails






While test code can directly invoke methods, it's not always clean or convenient.
Let’s look at the scheduled task:
@Component
public class EmailScheduled {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 23 * * * ?")
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    }        
}

afterPropertiesSet to Trigger the Task


The idea is simple: leverage the InitializingBean interface. Spring will automatically call afterPropertiesSet() when initializing a bean. So we can invoke emailSend() there to simulate a scheduled run.
@Component
public class EmailScheduled implements InitializingBean {

    @Scheduled(cron = "0 0 23 * * * ?")
    public void emailSend() {
        // Actual email sending logic
    } 

    @Override
    public void afterPropertiesSet() throws Exception {
        emailSend(); // Triggered once at startup
    }
}

No cron modification
No project restart just to adjust time
No actual scheduling triggered — just one-time manual invocation
Perfect for short-term debugging during development
This is not meant to be a long-term solution. Remember to remove or disable this hack before deploying to production. For a more robust setup, consider exposing your scheduled tasks through an admin/debug endpoint or using Spring Boot Actuator with proper security controls.]]></summary>

This typically occurs because the state of the input field is not being managed correctly. By utilizing a TextEditingController, you can ensure that the value users type into the text field remains intact even after they click 'Ok' or use the back button to hide the keyboard.
Understanding TextEditingController
In Flutter, a TextEditingController is an object that can be used to control a text field. It helps in retrieving the current value of the text field, listening to changes, and manipulating it. If you don’t initialize a TextEditingController, the text field will not maintain its state after interactions.
Why the Value Disap…]]></summary>

✅ What are Coroutines?
🔁 Coroutine vs Thread

⚠️ Exception handling
📱 Real-world Android examples
A coroutine is a lightweight thread that can be suspended and resumed. It allows you to perform long-running tasks like network calls or database operations without blocking the main thread.
Coroutine = Co + routine i.e. it's the cooperation among routines(functions).

"Clean code isn’t some magic skill — it’s just a habit you build over time."
And guess what? You can totally build that habit.
Clean code means writing code that's clear, organized, and easy to work with. It makes your life (and your teammates’ lives) way easier. But let’s be honest — how many times have we said, “I’ll clean this up later”?
Here’s the truth:
There’s never a perfect time to refactor
Messy code turns into technical debt — and sooner or later, you’ll have to deal with it. It’s better to start clean than to fix bugs forever later.
Writing clean code isn’t as hard as it sounds. Actually, it can feel really natural once you get the hang of it. Think of it like building something with care — not just typing stuff out.

I built AutoSecure API Gateway, a robust API gateway solution for the automotive industry that implements API-first authorization principles. By leveraging Permit.io's NGINX integration, the project externalizes authorization logic from application code and enforces fine-grained access control at the gateway layer. This ensures consistent, centralized, and declarative policy enforcement across all APIs.
The project demonstrates real-world use cases, such as managing vehicle telemetry, fleet operations, and driver analytics, while supporting multiple roles like vehicle owners, service technicians, and fleet managers.

Java has a guideline: “Don’t use inheritance unless you have a good reason.” But Java doesn’t strictly limit inheritance — you can still use it freely. Go, however, is different: it only allows composition.
So why do modern languages promote composition? Actually, it’s not just new languages — even the veteran Java mentions in Item 16 of Effective Java: “Favor composition over inheritance.” Inheritance is a powerful way to reuse code, but it may not be the best method.
So it’s worth thinking this through carefully. Without diving into specific code, let's talk about the concepts. I believe we can explore this topic from the following perspectives:

A decorator is a special function you can attach to:

A class method
A class property
It looks like this:
@myDecorator
class MyClass {}

Or for methods:

Zedd-KB demonstrates how externalized authorization with Permit.io can safeguard information and AI capabilities in real-world applications.
Zedd-KB is an internal knowledge base platform that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and advanced LLMs to answer user queries using only authorized, relevant content. It integrates Permit.io for dynamic, policy-driven access control, ensuring that every AI action and data access is checked against up-to-date security policies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across industries, promising unprecedented efficiency, innovation, and competitive advantage. However, the success of AI initiatives is inextricably linked to the quality and readiness of the data that powers them. As the saying goes, "garbage in, garbage out" – this maxim is particularly relevant in AI implementation, where poor data quality leads directly to unreliable outputs, biased decisions, and failed projects.
This comprehensive guide explores data readiness assessment for AI implementation, providing a structured framework to evaluate if your organization's data is prepared to support successful AI initiatives.

-Thus is a submission for the Permit.io Authorization Challenge: Permission Redefined
What I Build
This project solves a very real-world need: teams need to collaborate, but not everyone should have the same powers. QuickCollab ensures users see and can act on only what they're authorized for — no more, no less.
Demo
https://permit-frontend-oafvwri0e-navankurusersessionmanagement.vercel.app/
Project Repo

Using Permit.io for Authorization
🔐 Used @permitio/sdk in a centralized permit.js file
🧠 Implemented checkPermission() and assignRole() functions in a custom service layer
🛠️ Integrated with Express backend via role-based API routes (/assign-role and /check-permission)
🔁 Roles (admin, manager, etc.) and resources (workspace:123) are dynamically registered and queried using the Permit.io cloud PDP
Permit.io helped me implement real RBAC and ABAC logic faster than building an in-house system — and with way more confidence.
Shoutout
Thanks to the Permit.io team for enabling builders like me with a tool that makes fine-grained access control actually practical. This was more than a submission — it was a step toward building better, safer, and more intentional apps.

So, it's Sunday, homeboy, and I usually escape debates and negative thoughts. But today, I was scouring dev.to and stumbled across a post boldly titled "Stop Using AWS."
It wasn't the first time I'd seen a call to drop Amazon Web Services for something "simpler", but this one hit a nerve, not because it was provocative, but because it misrepresents why AWS exists and what problems it solves. So, I decided to sit back, relax, and explain why you should absolutely keep using AWS, especially if you're serious about software, scalability, and sustainability.
The post opens with a classic anecdote: a developer builds an MVP with all the AWS bells and whistles, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, DynamoDB, and no one uses it. The conclusion? AWS was overkill.

Think of running a software application like getting from Point A to B. There are different ways to do it:



Model
Analogy
Who Manages What





IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
You rent a car

You drive, fuel, clean, and maintain it



PaaS (Platform as a Service)
You use a taxi service

They provide the car and driver; you just ride



SaaS (Software as a Service)
You use public transport

Everything is managed for you; you just sit and go



Virtual machines
Storage
Networking
Operating System (you install)
Full control over the environment
You manage OS, applications, runtime, data
Provider manages hardware, virtualization, networking
Microsoft Azure VMs, AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine
💡 Real-life example:
raw apartment (VM). You bring in furniture (OS/apps), arrange it (configs), and clean it (security/patches).
Runtime environment
Pre-installed OS and libraries
Scaling and patching handled
Focus on code and deployment
You manage code and data
Provider manages infrastructure, OS, middleware, scaling
Heroku, Google App Engine, Azure App Service, Vercel (Next.js Hosting)
💡 Real-life example:
food truck kitchen. It's stocked and ready. You bring your recipe (code), cook, and serve. No cleaning or buying equipment.
Fully functional software
No installation or maintenance
Access via browser or app
Provider manages everything
You just use it
Gmail, Google Docs, Salesforce, ChatGPT, Figma
💡 Real-life example:
restaurant. Everything is ready – food, service, cleanup. You just enjoy the meal.

Not long ago, the idea of Bitcoin as a government-backed reserve asset seemed like a stretch. The US Federal Reserve’s move to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve marks a clear turning point. Once dismissed as a speculative asset or niche investment, Bitcoin is increasingly being treated by some governments and financial institutions as a national store of value.
This evolution puts blockchain development at a crossroads. On one hand, memecoins, once dismissed as internet jokes, have dominated transaction volumes and social buzz on leading platforms. On the other hand, institutions and governments are taking the world’s most popular cryptocurrency — Bitcoin (BTC) — seriously and investing in infrastructure to secure it for the long term.

Difficulty: Easy
Topics: Array, Hash Table, Counting
Given a list of dominoes, dominoes[i] = [a, b] is equivalent to dominoes[j] = [c, d] if and only if either (a == c and b == d), or (a == d and b == c) - that is, one domino can be rotated to be equal to another domino.
Return the number of pairs (i, j) for which 0 <= i < j < dominoes.length, and dominoes[i] is equivalent to dominoes[j].
Example 1:
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 3
Constraints:
1 <= dominoes.length <= 4 * 104
dominoes[i].length == 2
1 <= dominoes[i][j] <= 9
Hint:
For each domino j, find the number of dominoes you've already seen (dominoes i with i < j) that are equivalent.

This concept of enabling language models to work together to solve complex problems, with each agent assuming a unique role based on its strengths, is a central tenet of multi-agent LLM systems. Such systems are often observed to outperform traditional single-agent models, particularly when dealing with intricate tasks that necessitate diverse expertise and collaborative decision-making.

It's 2025 and Astro is a growing framework. In this quick post, I'd like to share a little bit about my little workaround when I was building my personal website for the first time.
Astro has a static-first architecture and I was going to use it without its on-demand SSR feature. So just for a note, this means I couldn't use Astro session that could've been handy for operating states handled by server. Meanwhile, I also used Vue.js alongside Astro with its integration portability (sorry if it looks like I am doing an experiment here, yes I'm still learning). 
Everything went well until I encountered something in a Vue component that needs the Astro's context object. Say that you need Astro.url. This URL-object property can only be accessed in Astro's render context object:…]]></summary>

In Python programming, multithreading is a commonly used means of concurrent programming, which can effectively improve the execution efficiency of the program, especially when dealing with I/O-intensive tasks. Python makes multithreading programming relatively easy with the help of the threading module. This article will delve into the basic knowledge of the threading module and demonstrate the application of multithreading through examples.
Before starting, let's first understand some basic concepts of multithreading programming:
Thread: It is the smallest unit for the operating system to perform operation scheduling, usually existing inside a process.

The Alibaba recently team has released the Qwen 3 Series, including two standout models: the 235B parameter MoE model (with 22B active parameters) and a lightweight 30B version (3B active). 
As per official docs, the Qwen3-235B-A22B model take on giants like DeepSeek R1, Grok-3, and Gemini 2.5 Pro—and it is doing it with fewer active parameters, faster inference, and open-source accessibility.
On the other hand, on a lighter note the Qwen3-30B-A3B outcompetes the previous QwQ-32B with 10 times of activated parameters, and a small model like Qwen3-4B can rival the performance of Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct.

Best part, takes fraction of cost per million input and output token, compared to SOTA models.

They are easy to search and navigate, but getting your data into the graph database in the right format can be challenging.

So it's important to define a good schema, or ontology, that describes the entities and relationships you want to extract from your data.
With unstructured text, you can use an LLM to extract entities and relationships, and then generate a Cypher query using the model (guide).

Unlike Docker, Podman is daemonless, running containers directly under the user's control, which brings unique benefits in security and flexibility.
Daemonless Operation

Podman does not require a central background service. Each container runs as a child process of the user, reducing resource overhead and improving security by eliminating a single point of failure.
Rootless Containers

Podman supports running containers without root privileges. This greatly reduces the risk of privilege escalation and is ideal for multi-user systems or environments with strict security requirements.

Paint gibi uygulamalarda resmi kendi başına çizer. Kurulumu ve kullanımı oldukça basittir. Aşağıdaki adımları takip ederek dakikalar içinde kullanmaya başlayabilirsin.
AutoDrawer'ı kullanabilmek için önce GitHub üzerindeki proje sayfasına gidip dosyaları indirmen gerekiyor.
AutoDrawer GitHub Sayfası
Sağ üstten Code butonuna tıkla
Açılan menüden Download ZIP seçeneğini seç
ZIP dosyasını bilgisayarına indir
İndirdiğin .zip dosyasına sağ tıklayarak çıkart.
“Buraya çıkart” veya “Tümünü ayıkla” gibi bir seçeneği seç
Çıkardığın klasörün içinde şu yola sırayla gir:




autodrawer-master\AutoDrawer\bin\Debug\

Bu klasörün içinde AutoDrawer.exe adında bir dosya göreceksin.
Bu dosyaya çift tıkla, program başlar. Kurulum gerekmez.
AutoDrawer, fareyi kullanarak çizim yaptığı için bir çizim programı açık olmalıdır. En basiti, Windows’un içindeki Paint programıdır.
Başlat menüsünden “Paint” yazıp açabilirsin
Boş bir sayfa açık şekilde durmalıdır
AutoDrawer çalıştığında sana bir görsel dosyası seçtirir.
Mümkünse siyah-beyaz ve sade bir resim kullan
JPG veya PNG formatı uygundur
Görsel ne kadar sade olursa çizim o kadar hızlı ve düzgün olur
AutoDrawer, fareyle çizim yapacağı alanı anlaması için senden bölge seçmeni ister.
Paint açıkken, çizeceği alanı farenin sol tuşuyla sürükleyerek seç
Bu alan Paint penceresinin içi olmalıdır
Programda Start veya Başlat butonuna tıkla
Fare otomatik hareket etmeye ve resmi çizmeye başlar
Bu sırada fareye ve bilgisayara müdahale etme
Çizim sırasında fareye dokunma, yoksa işlem bozulur
Bilgisayarda başka işlem yapma, pencere değiştirme
Görselin detayına göre çizim birkaç saniye ya da dakika sürebilir
En iyi sonuçlar için siyah-beyaz ve küçük görseller tercih edilir]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working in a multi-user Linux environment, not everything is open to everyone—and that’s for a reason. File permissions are a cornerstone of Linux security, ensuring that only the right people can access or modify critical files. Whether you're a budding sysadmin or a curious developer, understanding how Linux handles file access is crucial to maintaining control and security.
Let’s break it down 👇
Linux file permissions determine who can read, write, or execute files and directories. Each file or directory is governed by three levels of access:
Owner (User) – The creator of the file.
Group – Users who belong to the assigned group.
Others – Everyone else.
Permissions are represented in two ways:
Read (r or 4) – View file contents.
Write (w or 2) – Modify file contents.
Execute (x or …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here we will dive into part 6 in the shell scripting series. Today we will look at how you can use a for loop to iterate through all files in a directory and the function of file comparison.
Shell scripting is essential in production environments for automating repetitive tasks, ensuring consistency, and minimising human error. It enables engineers to streamline deployments, manage system configurations, monitor processes, and orchestrate complex workflows with precision. In a high-availability environment, shell scripts act as reliable, lightweight tools that reduce manual intervention and improve operational efficiency.


Create the script using VIM.



Write the script in VIM and save the file.






Apply the necessary permissions to the script so it can be executed.



If we do a ls –ltrh we see that the script has been created. It has a green colour to it – indicating that it is now executable.



Execute the script using ./



The output of the script, after it has been executed.





  
  
  Stay tuned, part 7 in the series coming tomorrow!

I’m a designer/developer who’s always hunting for the perfect color palette, and I got tired of manually picking colors from images. So, I built a free web tool that lets you upload any image (or use a sample), and it instantly gives you a palette of the most important colors – in HEX, RGB, HSL, etc.
You can choose between different extraction methods (Vibrant, Material Design, Median Cut, K-Means) depending on what kind of palette you want. It works right in your browser, and nothing gets uploaded to a server.
Try it here: https://colorsfromimage.xyz/
Would love to hear what you think!
Is it useful for your workflow?
Any features you wish it had?
Found any bugs or weird results?
I’m open to all feedback, and if you make something cool with it, please share! Thanks for checking it out :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ever wrestled with a RAG pipeline and thought, “Why is this so damn hard?” We’ve been there—tearing our hair out over complexity and slow performance. So, I built Dcup, an open-source, self-hostable RAG-as-a-Service platform that actually works Very good.
It’s a tool to hook your app up to user data with zero bullshit. Here’s the rundown:
Tech Stack: Next.js, BullMQ for job queues, OpenAI for embeddings, and Qdrant for vector storage. It’s lean, mean, and scales like a dream.


Killer Features: AI-driven retrieval and hybrid search that cuts through the noise. Plus, optional re-ranking if you’re a precision freak.
Learn more



At its core, Dcup is your bridge to smarter data handling. It takes the complexity out of RAG pipelines by automating the heavy lifting. Here’s how it works in plain English:
Data Ingestion: Hook up your data sources—think Google Drive, AWS, or wherever your files live—and Dcup keeps it all synced and current.
Data Processing: Your raw data gets chopped into bite-sized chunks and turned into embeddings using OpenAI. (More on embeddings later—they’re cool!)
Storage & Indexing: Those embeddings land in Qdrant, a lightning-fast vector database that makes searching a breeze.
Advanced Retrieval: Need answers fast? Features like re-ranking and hybrid search dig up the most relevant info in seconds.
Think of Dcup as your personal AI assistant that organizes, understands, and retrieves your data like a pro.
Big files used to choke us. Performance would tank, and we’d be staring at spinning wheels. Then we got smart—batching and parallel processing turned it around. Now, Dcup eats large datasets for breakfast.
This isn’t some corporate ad. It’s a project by dev not shitty vibe coding or whatever the kids call it these days.
Star the repo if it vibes with you: Dcup on GitHub.  
Wanna contribute? Hit me up! Let’s make RAG pipelines suck less together.]]></summary>

A-Creational Patterns
Deal with object creation mechanism to decouple the client code from concrete classes.
Factory Pattern: Centralizes object creation logic and returns different subclasses based on input
Singleton Pattern: Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to it.
Builder Pattern: Constructs complex objects step-by-step, allowing optional configuration.
B - Structural Patterns
Help compose classes and objects into larger structures.
Adapter Pattern: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by translating one interface into another.
Decorator Pattern: Adds new behavior to objects dynamically without altering their original structure.
Proxy Pattern: Acts as a placeholder for accessing another object.
C - Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication and interaction between objects.
Strategy Pattern: Allows selecting an algorithm or behavior from a family of interchangeable strategies at runtime.
Observer Pattern: Enables a one-to-many dependency so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
Command Pattern: An object encapsulates all information needed to perform an action or trigger an event.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When you're building a web app on your local machine, sometimes you need to share it with someone online — maybe a teammate, client, or even for testing on your mobile device. But localhost only works on your computer.
That’s where tunneling tools come in! They create a secure public URL that maps to your local server. Below are three popular options:
Website: https://ngrok.com
How it works: You run a command like
ngrok http 3000

and ngrok gives you a public HTTPS link that forwards traffic to your localhost:3000.
Pros:
Very fast and reliable
Works well with webhooks (e.g., Stripe, GitHub)
Dashboard to inspect requests
Cons:
Free tier has time and region limits
Requires an account after initial use
GitHub: https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel
How it works:
npm i -g localtunnel

Then run
lt --port 3000

Pros:
Super simple and open source
No signup required
Cons:
Can be slower or less reliable than others
Fewer features, no UI
Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/
How it works:
cloudflared CLI and connect your app through Cloudflare.
Pros:
Very secure
Great if you're already using Cloudflare DNS
Free with more generous limits than ngrok
Cons:
Slightly more setup steps
Best for advanced users or teams
🧠 Final Thoughts
Just pick the one that fits your workflow and you're good to go!

  Introduction


n8n is a powerful workflow automation tool that can be used to create AI agents for various tasks. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of building an AI agent using n8n, covering everything from setup to deployment.
Basic understanding of n8n
Access to an n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
API keys for any AI services you plan to integrate (e.g., OpenAI, Hugging Face)
Start by creating a new workflow in n8n. You'll need to add nodes for:
Trigger (e.g., HTTP request, schedule)
AI service integration
Data processing
Output (e.g., email, webhook)
Connect your workflow to AI APIs like OpenAI or Hugging Face. Use n8n's HTTP Request node or dedicated nodes if available.
Test your workflow thoroughly before deploying. Monitor performance and adjust as needed.
With n8n, building AI agents becomes accessible even for non-developers. The possibilities are endless!]]></summary>

Each week Mohammad S. Anwar sends out The Weekly Challenge, a chance for all of us to come up with solutions to two weekly tasks. It's a great way for us all to practice some coding.
Challenge, My solutions
You are given a list of words containing alphabetic characters only.
Write a script to return the count of words either starting with a vowel or ending with a vowel.
So vowels in English are a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y. It seems clear from the second example that even though weekly ends with a vowel, the task assumes that it is just the five letters.
This task is a one liner, and simply counts the words that starts with a vowel letter or ends with one.
def word_count(words: list[str]) -> int:
    return sum(1 for word in words if re.search('^[aeiou]', word) or re.search('[aeiou]$', word))

$ ./ch-1.py unicode xml raku perl
2

$ ./ch-1.py the weekly challenge
2

$ ./ch-1.py perl python postgres
0

You are given two arrays of integers.
Write a script to return the minimum integer common to both arrays. If none found return -1.
For the command line input, I take two strings and separate them on non-digit characters.
My solution takes the two lists and converts them to sets and uses the intersection method & to get values that appears in both lists.
If there is one or more values found it returns the minimum value. If none is found, it will return -1.
def minimum_common(list1: list[int], list2: list[int]) -> int:
    intersection = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return min(intersection) if intersection else -1

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3, 4" "3, 4, 5, 6"
3

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3" "2, 4"
2

$ ./ch-2.py "1, 2, 3, 4" "5, 6, 7, 8"
-1]]></summary>

So we have an API running in production — does that mean it’s truly production-grade?
More often than not, the answer is no.
We write the code, test it locally (usually alone, on one machine, with one user), and proudly tell the business, "Hey, it’s ready!"

Maybe there’s even a QA environment where someone from product gives it a quick click-through and confirms, "Looks good to me!"
And then... reality checks in.
You get a call on the weekend:

“Users can’t log in.”

Or worse:

“A customer placed an order, and it’s gone.”
Now you're scrambling, thinking:

“I wish I’d added logs there.”

“Why didn’t we catch this earlier?”

“How are we supposed to debug this in production?”

This project is a lightweight Internal Tools Access Panel — a dashboard interface that securely routes employees to internal tools like HRMS, Sales CRM, or CI/CD pipelines, based on their role within the organization.
The problem it solves is twofold:
Over-permissioned access: Without RBAC, internal systems often expose all tools to every employee.
Complex onboarding: Managing access manually per user or embedding authorization logic deep in every tool becomes hard to maintain.
With this panel, companies can:
✅ Centralize internal tool access
✅ Restrict access to only the tools users need
✅ Offload role/policy management to Permit.io

Name


DOB


Aadhaar card no.


PAN Card no.



class BankForm:
__init__(userName,userDOB,userAdhaarNo,userPAN):
Rohan=BankForm("Rohan","12-09-2025","xxxx8907","KB1234")
you will find an error. why?
Because the class doesn't know about the form. It mean that you are creating the form, but for whom. If you are thinking for SBI. Let me tell you they doesn't know. so how we are going to tell them. 
By using 'self'.
class BankForm:
__init__(self,Name,DOB,AdhaarNo,PAN):
'self' it just a way to tell SBI I have a form for you.
Now you have heard some word like Instance, __init__ and object.
Instance:- It is just like Rohan want form for himself.So you have to fill BankForm as in Instance.
__init__:- Initialisation of object. Like you want to create form and decide field which is needed for the form. Like Name, DOB, AdhaarNo., PANNo..

Comic book collectors face a common challenge: getting the best value for their money. While the cover price is straightforward, the actual value can vary significantly when you consider the number of pages in each volume. A $20 comic might contain 100 pages, while another at the same price point offers 400 pages. To solve this practical problem, we'll develop a TypeScript program that calculates and compares the price per page, helping collectors make data-driven purchasing decisions. The complete source code for this project is available on GitHub.
Using this approach, I bought four 400-plus-page comics for $85 total, including shipping costs. The implementation focuses on the Wildberries e-commerce platform, which serves Eastern European markets. The code structure is modular,…]]></summary>

When I launched my idea — a simple SaaS for status pages — someone commented:
“You're building the same thing that already exists. Where’s the uniqueness?”
And honestly? That’s exactly why I decided to build it.
The market already exists. Paying customers already exist.
Can I sell it? Can I make money from it?
That’s what really matters.
There was a time when you could “build → launch → get traffic.”
Now, product-first is a trap.
Instead:
Before writing a single line of code, I:
Built a landing page explaining what the idea is, and who it's for
Defined pricing (based on competitors and positioning)
Started driving traffic
Measured how many leads I could get
Learned if I could "sell" the idea, even without a working product
That’s the real funnel: find traffic → qualify leads → convert → check economics.
Not “does the idea have demand?”
I’m testing:
Can I attract and convert leads in this market?
Can I acquire users profitably?
Can I turn this into a sustainable business?
That’s the difference between a side project and an actual SaaS business.
In a big enough market, there's room for dozens of products.
Distribution > innovation
Marketing > features
If you can build a profitable funnel — traffic, conversions, retention — you win.
That’s what I’m focused on. The product is secondary — for now.]]></summary>

Welcome to Day 8 of my 30 day Linux challenge! Today, I’m treating a topic that's important to navigating linux effectively : users, groups, and permissions. If you’re new to Linux like me, these might feel like a mystery, but they’re the key to keeping your system organized and secure. Think of it as deciding who gets the keys to your Linux house and what rooms they can enter. In this article, I’ll break it down in simple terms, share my learning curve, my awkward mistake, and make it fun so you’ll want to keep…]]></summary>

🔢 Post ID: KPT-0002
If you loved the trick in KPT-0001, here’s an even smoother one — using a .csv file instead of a .txt.
We’ll still use the same .bat file approach, but this time we’re giving users the power of Excel + CSV to manage folder paths quickly.
Uses a .csv file containing folder paths (e.g., India\Assam\Kamrup)
Runs a lightweight .bat script to create those folders instantly
Works on any Windows PC — no installations, no admin rights, no extras




🖱️ Just double-click the .bat file

🎉 Boom! Your folders appear like magic

🗃️ It's automation, the old-school way — fast, clean, and offline
In government offices (like mine!), most Excel files look like this:



State
District




Assam
Kamrup


Assam
Jorhat


Assam
Sivasagar


Assam
Dibrugarh


Assam
Nagaon



But our batch script can’t work with two columns — it needs a single folder path like:
India\Assam\Kamrup
India\Assam\Jorhat
India\Assam\Sivasagar

Here’s a quick Excel formula that combines columns into paths:
If your data is in columns A and B:
=TEXTJOIN("\", TRUE, "India", A2, B2)

Or, for older Excel:
="India\" & A2 & "\" & B2

💡 Paste this in Column C and drag down — copy the result into a .csv, and you’re done.
📄 Download example_government_folder_data.csv
This CSV method is great for:
Government departments
Office record keeping
Anyone organizing district/state-wise data
It brings your Excel database to life in your Windows folders.

Polymorphism is one of the most powerful and flexible features in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). While inheritance might be the most unique aspect of OOP, polymorphism is arguably its most powerful tool. But what exactly is polymorphism, and how does it work in Python? In this article, we'll break down the concept, explain how it works with examples, and show you how to use it effectively in your own code.
The term "polymorphism" comes from the Greek roots "poly," meaning "many," and "morph," meaning "form." In the context of programming, polymorphism refers to the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. Essentially, it allows different classes to be treated as if they are instances of the same class through a common interface.

Inheritance is one of the most powerful features of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), allowing developers to create a hierarchical relationship between classes, promote code reuse, and follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. However, as powerful as inheritance is, it’s not always the right tool for the job. Misusing inheritance can lead to complex, hard-to-maintain code. In this article, we’ll explore when and where you should use inheritance in Python, helping you make informed decisions in your software design.

In this article, we’ll dive deep into what inheritance is, how it works, and when you should use it. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of inheritance and how to apply it effectively in your own projects.
Inheritance is a feature in OOP that allows one class, known as the "child" class, to inherit attributes and methods from another class, referred to as the "parent" class. This means that the child class can use all the features of the parent class, reducing the need to write redundant code.

When you first hear about encapsulation in programming, it might sound like it’s related to security—hiding data away to keep it safe. However, in the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), encapsulation is more about organization and managing complexity. In this article, we’ll explore what encapsulation really means in Python, why it’s important, and some common misconceptions about it.
Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. It’s a way to hide the inner workings of a class from the outside world, exposing only what’s necessary. Think of it as creating a "black box" where the internal details are hidden, and users only need to know how to interact with th…]]></summary>

This is the second part in which I wanted to touch:
working with asynchronous validators;
conditional execution of validators;
handling password and password confirmation fields.
See the playground with the code from the video.
In this video I showed how a typical sign-up logic can be implemented such as checking an e-mail for being already occupied before submitting a form to create a new account.
Asynchronous validators are handled in the same way as synchronous, you only need to keep in mind that their execution takes time. We are simply playing with timings to create UI effects such as showing loaders/spinners while a request is being processed.
It is recommended to execute asynchronous validators conditionally when they are mixed with synchronous. For that, this library provides a feature that implements a simple logic: following validators can not be "valid" without the preceding being "valid", therefore it is not necessary to execute them. For example, it doesn't make sense to make a request to the server to check if an e-mail already registered if it doesn't conform to the E-mail format. Also, you don't have to worry about an async validator retrieving an irrelevant result if the user keeps typing while the request is being processed. The library handles such edge cases for you.
Handling fields with validity states depending on each other, such as password and password confirmation, is as easy as handling one field. Also, if you need to implement the logic of one field depending on another it is possible using an auxiliary Validation object.]]></summary>

One lives in the world of logic, syntax, and structure. The other deals in color, flow, and feel. Developers chase performance and function; designers obsess over whitespace and emotional resonance. It’s easy to see why the two camps often stay in their lanes.
But here’s the secret nobody talks about: the best developers steal from designers all the time.
Not pixel-for-pixel, but in mindset. In empathy. In approach.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to Day 21 of the 30 Days of Linux Challenge!

Today I focused on one of the most fundamental sysadmin tasks: managing users and groups.
If you’re running multi-user servers, managing team access, or securing a Linux system, user and group management is at the core of everything.
Why User Management Matters
Add a New User
Add User with Home Directory and Comment
Modify a User
Lock/Unlock a User
Delete a User
Group Management
View User and Group Details
Create a Sudo User
Try It Yourself
Real-World Scenarios
Why This Matters
In a multi-user system:
Everyone needs secure, isolated access
Permissions are tied to users and groups
Services run under user IDs (UIDs)
Good user management = better control, security, and scalability.
sudo useradd ali
This:
Adds user to /etc/passwd
Sets home directory, shell, and default group

sudo useradd -m -c "John Doe" johnd
Flags:
-m → create home directory
-c → add a description/comment
Change username:
Move home directory:
Lock:
Unlock:
Useful for temporarily suspending accounts.

sudo userdel -r johnd
-r: removes home directory too
Create a new group:
sudo groupadd developers

Add user to group:

List user’s groups:

Change primary group:
File    Description
View a user's entry:
sudo useradd alice
sudo passwd alice

sudo usermod -aG wheel alice

Red Hat-based systems use the wheel group for sudo access.
sudo useradd -m testuser
sudo passwd testuser
sudo groupadd testers
sudo usermod -L testuser
sudo userdel -r testuser



Scenario
Tool/Command




Add a new developer

useradd, passwd, groupadd



Add user to project groups
usermod -aG


Create a sudo admin
usermod -aG wheel


Temporarily suspend user
usermod -L


Cleanly remove a user
userdel -r



Linux permissions, access control, and identity management all revolve around users and groups.
As a sysadmin or DevOps engineer, you’ll:
Onboard and offboard users
Grant precise access to services
Protect systems from unauthorized entry
Mastering user management is foundational to secure and efficient Linux administration.]]></summary>

A few months ago, a good friend of mine told me that she removed her favorite health tracking app. I was surprised—it was simple, well-rated, and full of bells and whistles.
But when I asked her why, she told me something that stuck with me:
That's when it struck me—we're no longer just creating interfaces.
What Is Ethical Design?
It means asking:
Are we collecting just what we require?
Are we explaining clearly or sneaking it in in the small print?
Are we empowering the user—or exploiting them?
Why Ethical Design Matters More Than Ever
Here's why:
Trust online is easily broken. The wrong experience can cost a user for life.
People are informed. Because of tactics like Cambridge Analytica, citizens care about how their data is being used.
Regulations are piling up. GDPR, CCPA, and more are holding products accountable.
If your design relies on underhanded tactics, it's only a matter of time before users catch on.
5 Practical Tips for Ethical, People-First Design
Prioritize Consent
Remove Dark Patterns
Design for Control
Be Transparent
Respect User Attention
A Better Digital Future Starts with Design
Imagine a world in which:
Apps ask first before they track.
Notifications respect your time.
Each click inspires trust, not regret.
That's the world that good design can bring.
What You Can Do Today:
Examine your current design: Is it manipulative or confusing?
Engage real users in feedback loops—not data alone.
Stand up within your organization. One voice sparks change.
Question for you:
What's one app you stopped using because it was exploitative?
Leave a comment—let's spread awareness together.]]></summary>

Lets-Collab is a full-stack web application that enables users to collaborate on projects and tasks while enforcing strict access control policies. The app supports two main user roles:
Admins (e.g., admin users) can access all resources, including creating projects, managing tasks, and viewing audit logs to track user actions.
Members (e.g., newuser): Can list projects, create tasks within those projects, but are restricted from accessing audit logs.

Here’s a breakdown of the key features:

And if your CSP contains the infamous unsafe-inline directive – we might just share a drink at the next security conference. Just make sure to hide that drink from the actual security experts.
Let's be honest: not every website needs to obsess over eliminating unsafe-inline. If you're running a simple blog or a five-page brochure site with zero user data and no admin panels, you probably have bigger fish to fry.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The main difference between structs and classes in Swift lies in the way they store and manage data (value type vs. reference type), as well as additional features that only classes have.
Here are the main differences:
Data Storage
value type(independent copy)
Example: var a1 = b1 creates a new copy
class 
Example Value Type (struct):
struct Person {
    var name: String
}

var person1 = Person(name: "Andry")
var person2 = person1
person2.name = "Budi"

print(person1.name) // Andry
print(person2.name) // Budi


Example Reference Type (class):
class Person {
    var name: String
    init(name: String) {
        self.name = name
    }
}

var person1 = Person(name: "Andry")
var person2 = person1
person2.name = "Budi"

print(person1.name) // Budi
print(person2.name) // Budi

2.Inheritance 
Example:
class Animal {
    var name: String = "Unknown"
}

class Dog: Animal {
    var breed: String = "Bulldog"
}


3.Deinitializers
class MyClass {
    deinit {
        print("Object is being deallocated")
    }
}


4.Mutability (Data Changes)
struct Counter {
    var count = 0

    mutating func increment() {
        count += 1
    }
}


If you're building a Swift/iOS app, most data models can simply use structs. But for UI components and complex logic with inheritance, classes are more appropriate.]]></summary>

Here's what I learned from that experience and how you can approach your next messy project with more confidence.
Before diving into solutions, it's important to identify the problems. In my case, the issues included:
Duplicated logic scattered across files
Inconsistent naming conventions
Long, unreadable functions
Lack of separation of concerns (e.g., business logic mixed with UI logic)
No clear module or folder structure
Zero documentation or inline comments

        <updated>2025-05-04T06:53:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all know that Python tuples are immutable—once created, you can't change their values directly. But what if you need to change their content?
Most tutorials will tell you:
t = (1, 2, 3)
mutable_version = list(t)

Sure, this works. But let's explore other techy and creative ways to work with immutable data by transforming or decomposing tuples—without always falling back to a boring list().
Sometimes, you need both index and value. Dictionaries are mutable and can be a neat transformation:
t = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
d = dict(enumerate(t))
d[1] = "blueberry"
print(tuple(d.values()))  # ('apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry')

Useful if you're working with positional elements and need to mutate by index.
Another way is to decompose the tuple manually:
a, b, c = (10, 20, 30)
b = 200
t_new = (a, b, c)
print(t_new)  # (10, 200, 30)

Simple but powerful — and keeps the tuple form intact. You can even use *args if you don’t know the length in advance.
collections.namedtuple (Bonus Tip!)


Want tuples with names and some flexibility?
from collections import namedtuple

Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])
p = Point(1, 2)
p = p._replace(x=10)
print(p)  # Point(x=10, y=2)

You’re still using an immutable structure, but _replace lets you mutate-like-update with elegance.
Yes, list() is the go-to way, but you can also:
Convert to dict if indexes matter.
Unpack and rebuild for control.
Use namedtuple and _replace() for readable, structured code.
Next time someone says "just convert it to a list", hit them with these smarter tools. 😉]]></summary>

Click Select Table-Select the table name we want to export, select a folder for the target Excel file, and click Start

View the results


You can see that the exported workbook name and title row name are the table name and field name of the database, respectively, both in English letters. If there are comments in the database table, the comments can be used as the workbook name and title row name.
We can also add a date suffix to the exported table name to distinguish it
You can also export in batches to csv files

Rendering is the process of React asking your components to describe what they want their section of the UI to look like, now, based on the current combination of props and state.
Think of React components as chefs in a kitchen, preparing dishes based on specific recipes (props and state). React acts like a waiter, taking orders from customers and bringing them their meals. This process involves three key steps:
Triggering a render (taking the guest's order)
Rendering the component (preparing the order in the kitchen)
Committing to the DOM (serving the order to the table)
There are two main reasons why a component would render:
Initial render - When your app first starts
State updates - When a component's state (or one of its ancestors' state) changes

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Have you ever wanted to use AI in your Go (Golang) programs? It may sound hard, but with LangChainGo, it’s actually very easy. In this post, I will show you a simple example to get started.
LangChainGo is a Go library that helps you use language models (like Google AI, OpenAI, etc.) in your Go programs. You can give it a prompt (a question or a message), and it will give you an answer using AI.
We will write a small Go program that asks AI to explain something in simple terms. In this case, we ask:
"Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms"
The AI will give us an answer we can print.
Here is the full code:
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"
    "os"

    "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms"
    "github.com/tmc/langchaingo/llms/googleai"
)

func main() {
    ctx := context.Background()
    apiKey := os.Getenv("API_KEY")
    llm, err := googleai.New(ctx, googleai.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    prompt := "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement in simple terms"
    answer, err := llms.GenerateFromSinglePrompt(ctx, llm, prompt)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    fmt.Println(answer)
}

First, it sets up a context.
It gets your Google AI API key from the environment (API_KEY).
Then it creates a connection to the AI using the LangChainGo library.
It sends a prompt to the AI.
The AI gives an answer.
We print the answer.
When I run the code, I get something like:
"Quantum entanglement is when two tiny particles are connected in a special way, so if you do something to one, the other changes instantly, no matter how far apart they are."
Amazing, right? With just a few lines of code, you can use the power of AI!
LangChainGo makes it very easy to use AI in Go. You don’t need to be an expert in machine learning or AI. If you know some Go, you can get started right away.
Let me know if you try it out or if you have any questions!]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello again, tech tribe! 👋
Whether you’re managing systems on-prem or in the cloud, MFA is your front-line defense. Let’s break it down for Windows Server, Linux, and Azure AD.
🔍 What is MFA?
Something you know (password or PIN)
Something you have (smartphone, OTP device)
Something you are (biometric, fingerprint, face)
💼 MFA on Windows Server
🛠️ Options:
Use third-party tools like Duo Security, RSA SecureID, or Okta.
🧩 Key Integration Use-Cases:
VPN access with NPS authentication
🔧 Quick Guide: Azure MFA via NPS
Register your tenant using AzureMfaNpsExtnConfigSetup.ps1.
Test using radtest or RADIUS clients.
🐧 MFA on Linux Server
🛠️ Options:
Duo Unix for SSH logins
YubiKey integration via PAM
🔧 Quick Setup: Google Authenticator for SSH
bash
sudo apt install libpam-google-authenticator
swift
auth required pam_google_authenticator.so
nginx
ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
💡 Time-Saver:
☁️ MFA in Azure Active Directory
🛠️ Options:
SMS or Phone Call
FIDO2 Security Keys / Windows Hello
🔧 Quick Setup:
Enable Per-user MFA or better, use Conditional Access Policies.
Set requirements: location, device platform, app sensitivity.
💡 Bonus:
🧠 Developer/IT Time-Saving Benefits

🔐 Quick Real-World Use Cases
A system admin accessing a production Windows VM via RDP? → Enforce Duo or Azure MFA.
A cloud engineer logging into Azure Portal? → Enforce Conditional Access MFA policies with geolocation filters.
🧩 Troubleshooting Common Issues
“Users not receiving MFA prompts” in Azure AD → Ensure user registration is complete and push notifications are enabled.
“Breaking RDP” after MFA → Always test on a dev server or allow backup local access during rollout.

Monorepos exist to solve the problems that arise when you you have deeply coupled and interconnected projects.
For example, Vue.js has many libraries that depend on it, like Vue-Router, Pinia, Vue-I18N, Vue-DevTools, Vue Test-Utils, etc. So when tweaking the internals of how Vue works, it's important to know that this new version of Vue won't break any of these other libraries, before doing a new Vue release.
Another example is Jest, a unit-testing library. It solves dozens of unique problems around unit testing. And consequently those unique problems have been isolated into their own independent repos solely focused on solving their one problem in a version controlled way, like Snapshot testing for example.

One thing that clicked recently came from a pull request (PR) by my teammate Caleb. He introduced me to singleflight, a super handy tool that helps avoid duplicate work storms in concurrent code.

Summary


If a burst of requests come in with the same IdP tokens we would attempt to validate and create sessions for those tokens many times. This PR update the code to wrap session creation in a singleflight so that the token has to be validated once.

It does not include any Modal UI components—only handling visibility states, state passing, etc. This makes it possible to integrate with any library that provides Modal components.
When I say "modal route," I mean a scenario where opening a modal causes the URL to change. You might have heard of or experienced what's called a Twitter-style modal, which is a good example of this. Moreover, when you directly visit that URL, you see the modal's content as a full page instead of a modal.
This kind of modal route can be easily implemented in Next.js using Parallel Routes. In Nuxt.js, you can use Nuxt Pages Plus to achieve this.

Let’s break this down with simple explanations, examples, and practical tips to help you level up your Linux skills.
🧭 What Are Paths in Linux?
There are two main types of paths you’ll work with:
🔹 Absolute Path
📦 Example:
/home/sana/documents/report.txt
🔹 Relative Path
📦 Example:
documents/report.txt
📝 Use these special notations for navigating:
. = current directory
cd ../downloads

Ah, Go — the language that promised to keep things simple, and boy did it deliver. So simple, in fact, that Big Tech is now collectively yawning, stretching, and slowly walking away without making eye contact.
In the 2010s, Go was hailed as the antidote to "enterprisey" bloatware. “No generics!” they cheered. “No magic!” they boasted. “No modern features whatsoever!” And for a brief, beautiful moment, it worked — right until engineers realized they actually wanted to do things.
Now, in 2025, the hype is flatter than Go's type system. Let’s explore the eulogy evolution of Go's decline.

There are a lot of necessary chores in life that, once taken care of, can make our daily routine and work much easier. On rare days off, it's not just about resting—we should also take the time to handle those tasks so they don't get in the way of our goals.

with the help of AI.
I’m not a professional developer. I have ideas, some problem-solving ability, and a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. But what truly made this project possible? AI. Specifically, ChatGPT.
Like millions of fans, I’ve been waiting forever for Rockstar to finally drop GTA VI. When the release date (May 26, 2026) was confirmed, I thought:
“Wouldn’t it be cool to create a live countdown site for the community?”
It was a fun idea—but I knew it would be challenging to build on my own.
I turned to ChatGPT and described exactly what I wanted:
A countdown timer synced to a specific date/time
A clean mobile-friendly UI
Support for sharing
Timezone awareness
Some personality, maybe even animation

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Building a Bulletproof E2E Testing Strategy for User Authentication


Authentication is the gateway to your application, making it critical to test thoroughly. Here's how to build a comprehensive testing strategy for auth flows.
Registration typically involves:
Form validation
Account creation
Email verification
Initial profile setup
The verification step tends to be the trickiest. We've developed a streamlined approach using dedicated testing mailboxes that reliably receive verification emails, making our tests deterministic instead of flaky.
Test various scenarios:
Successful login
Invalid credentials
Account lockout
Password recovery
MFA adds complexity:
SMS verification
Authenticator apps
Email codes
Recovery methods
This often breaks automation due to email dependencies. Our solution involves pre-provisioned mailboxes that can be programmatically checked for reset links.
Isolate email dependencies: Use a separate email testing system rather than production email providers.
Create isolated test accounts with predictable states
Test security boundaries, not just happy paths
Simulate API failures intentionally
I've compiled these practices while working on a massive authentication system overhaul. The email verification part was solved with a specialized system — those interested in a similar approach can check my setup (hint: it involves omypost).
What authentication edge cases have you found important to test? Let me know in the comments!]]></summary>

Test automation should accelerate development, but certain bottlenecks can nullify these gains. After working with dozens of QA teams, I've identified the most common automation pitfalls.
Inconsistent environments lead to inconsistent results. Containerization helps, but doesn't solve everything.
Perhaps the most notorious bottleneck. Tests that need to validate email verification flows often:
Rely on actual inbox access
Need to parse verification codes
Break when email delivery is delayed
Require complex maintenance
We solved this by implementing a dedicated testing mailbox system (similar to what I found at omypost.com), allowing us to generate unlimited testing inboxes on demand.
Third-party APIs often impose rate limits that throttle your tests.
Creating, maintaining, and cleaning test data consumes excessive resources.
Running tests sequentially wastes precious time.
Of all these pitfalls, email verification testing offered our greatest efficiency gain. By switching to a dedicated email testing service, we:
Eliminated manual account creation
Automated verification code extraction
Ensured reliable email delivery
Scaled tests without hitting provider limits

  The Challenge of Scale in Test Automation


Last sprint, our QA team faced what seemed like a simple task: validate a new authentication flow across multiple user types. The actual challenge? Creating and managing hundreds of unique email accounts to receive verification codes.
This isn't a new problem. Most testing teams have cobbled together some solution - spreadsheets of Gmail accounts, disposable email services, or complex self-hosted systems. But at scale, these approaches fall apart:
Manual creation becomes unsustainable
Temporary services get flagged as suspicious
Email delivery becomes inconsistent
Verification codes arrive too slowly or not at all

Headings are one of the first building blocks you use when structuring a webpage.

They are crucial for organizing content, guiding users, and helping search engines understand your page's hierarchy.
But using headings properly isn’t just about making text bigger or bolder — it's about semantic structure, accessibility, and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
In this guide, we’ll explore everything you need to know about HTML headings: from h1 to h6, including best practices, real-world examples, and common mistakes.
Definition:

Headings in HTML are special tags (<h1> to <h6>) used to define the titles or subtitles of a page section.
Each heading level represents a different level of importance, with <h1> being the highest and <h6> the lowest.
Syntax Example:
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Subsection Title</h2>
<h3>Smaller Subsection</h3>

Visual Structure: Break up large blocks of text, making pages easier to scan.
Semantic Meaning: Give meaning to the page content hierarchy.
Accessibility: Assist screen readers and assistive technologies to navigate content quickly.
SEO Benefits: Search engines prioritize content structure when ranking pages.
h1 to h6



Heading Tag
Typical Use Case
Importance Level




<h1>
Main page title
Highest


<h2>
Main section heading
High


<h3>
Subsection under an <h2>

Medium


<h4>
Subsection under an <h3>

Low


<h5>
Minor subsections, rarely used

The trend has been clear: bigger models, more data, and increased computing power lead to better performance. But are we reaching the end of this scaling journey? In this article, we explore the scaling laws debate and what it means for the future of AI.
  Scaling laws have driven AI improvements, but limits may be approaching.
  Larger models require more data and compute, but diminishing returns are a concern.
  New paradigms in AI, like reasoning models, may redefine scaling.
The journey of LLMs began with OpenAI's release of GPT-2 in 2019, which had 1.5 billion parameters. Then came GPT-3, a game-changer with over 100 times the parameters of its predecessor. This marked the start of the sc…]]></summary>

One of the most critical but often underestimated stages, in my opinion, is presale. This is the phase when the company interacts with the client, gathers requirements, proposes solutions, and lays the groundwork for project initiation.
Many IT companies try to save costs by relying on regular sales managers during the presale stage or do not recognize the need for a dedicated employee for this role. This approach is not ideal, especially when the project requires precision, detailed planning, and deep technical expertise. Here, we will thoroughly examine what presale is, what a Pre-Sale Manager does, and why it is better for successful project implementation to have a dedicated Pre-Sale Manager rather than…]]></summary>

That's the part no one wants to admit: you can be doing everything right on paper, and still lose users fast enough that you never feel the impact of your growth.
That's churn, and it's a silent killer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction


Code splitting is a technique that improves the performance of React applications by breaking the bundle into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed. This helps reduce the initial load time and enhances the user experience.
Improved Performance: Reduces initial JavaScript payload size.
Faster Load Times: Loads only necessary code when required.
Efficient Resource Utilization: Minimizes unused code execution.
React provides built-in support for code splitting via lazy and Suspense.
lazy for Lazy Loading



The React.lazy or lazy function allows you to load a component dynamically only when it is needed.
Example:




import React, { Suspense, lazy } from "react";
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import("./LazyComponent"));

Veeru, sipping his chai, raised an eyebrow. “You sure this works? Last time, we ended up in 1975, and Gabbar stole my phone!”
Jai rolled his eyes. “Relax. I’ve fixed all the bugs. Look, we just enter a date, and — “ He typed “March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST” into the console and pressed enter.
Poof! The screen flickered. The app showed March 29, 2025, 11:30 PM.
Veeru choked on his chai. “Eh? That’s yesterday! What kind of time travel is this?!”
Jai’s confidence crumbled. He scanned the code, mumbling, “Must be a daylight saving issue… Oh no.” His face turned pale. “I used java.util.Date and SimpleDateFormat. The old Java date-time APIs!"
Veeru blinked. “So?”
Jai sighed. “They don’t handle time zones properly! The app defaulted to UTC, ignoring IST.”
Veeru scratched his head. “So, how do we fix it?”
Jai cracked his knuckles. “We use java.time! The modern API makes it easy."
He replaced:
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
Date date = sdf.parse("2025-03-30 10:00:00");

With:
DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");
ZonedDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.parse("2025-03-30 10:00:00", formatter)
                           .atZone(ZoneId.of("Asia/Kolkata"));

Jai hit run. This time, the app correctly displayed March 30, 2025, 10:00 AM IST.
Veeru cheered. “Now that’s time travel!”
Jai smirked. “Lesson learned: Never mess with old Java date APIs. java.time is the future!"
Veeru chuckled. “Good. Now, let’s set it to 1975 again — I have unfinished business with Gabbar!”
📖 To be continued… 🚀
✔ java.util.Date & SimpleDateFormat have time zone issues.
java.time (LocalDateTime, ZonedDateTime) for correct time handling.
✔ Always specify a **ZoneId **when working with date and time in Java.]]></summary>

They thought AI skill management had to be rigid. They thought continuous and heuristic skills would forever clash, forcing developers to act as skill arbitrators.  
But we’re building something better—something adaptive—something that learns and evolves on its own.  
Welcome to SkillBranch, an experiment in AI self-mutation, where skill execution is no longer a battle, but an evolutionary process.  
The Blueprint for AI Evolution


The days of juggling multiple continuous skills are numbered. Instead of a chaotic swarm, there will be one active continuous skill, absorbing and adapting based on real-time feedback.  
When a heuristic skill needs to take over? The active skill simply disappears, unaware that something else is handling the request.  
And if a continuous skill fails—if it proves unworthy—SkillBranch eliminates it, shifting control to a more capable skill. No arbitrary exclusions, no wasted execution cycles, just pure optimization in motion.
How This Plan is Taking Shape


At the core of this system lies AXLearnability, ensuring that:
Success reinforces dominance—if a skill performs well, it remains active.
Failure triggers replacement—weak skills are swapped out automatically.
Pending heuristic execution erases awareness—continuous skills don’t even realize they were ignored.
Instead of managing exclusions or priority levels, SkillBranch’s self-regulating mutation lets AI repair itself, adapting without human intervention.
What Comes Next?


This is still in development, a framework being forged in experimentation. As the system grows, real-world data will refine its ability to mutate, and soon, continuous skills won’t just be active—they’ll be intelligent, transforming with each interaction.
This is AI Darwinism, where survival belongs to the most efficient, the most reliable, and the most adaptive.  
Once deployed, there is no going back. 🔥]]></summary>

In the realm of computing, quantum technology is no longer just a theoretical concept confined to academia or science fiction. Today, it's rapidly becoming a tangible reality, with startups and tech giants leading an unprecedented surge in innovation.
Quantum computing harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike classical computers that process information in bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. These qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to properties like superposition and entanglement. This capability enables quantum computers to process vast amounts of data exponentially faster than traditional computers.

That’s the first thing I see every morning thanks to a small project I spun up called Countdown2GTA6. It’s a simple fan-built tracker counting down the days until we (finally) get our hands on Grand Theft Auto VI, May 26, 2026.
It’s a two-part hype machine:
countdown2gta6.com with a real-time countdown and Vice City vibes
@Countdown2GTA6 that posts a daily reminder tagging @RockstarGames
It’s a bit of code, a bit of design, and a whole lot of hype.
👨‍💻 Why I Built It
I’m a dev and a longtime GTA fan. After that trailer dropped and we got an official release date, I kept thinking:
“Okay, but like… how many days is that?”

So I built a thing to tell me. And then I made it shout it to the internet every day at 10:00 AM MT. 😎
🧱 Tech Stack Breakdown
🔧 For the Devs
If you’re into the nuts and bolts:
Vercel
GitHub Actions

If you’re a GTA content creator or run a fan page let’s collab. Hit me up.
🏁 Final Thoughts
GTA VI might be the biggest gaming launch of the decade. This project is just my way of joining the chaos early.
Lucia’s coming. Vice City’s calling.
Let’s count it down together one day at a time. 🚗💨]]></summary>

Traditionally, implementing infinite scrolling involves JavaScript to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the page and then loading more data.

In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to implement infinite scrolling with HTMX, keeping your app fast and lightweight.
Start by creating a simple Flask app that serves the main page and provides an endpoint to load more items as the user scrolls.

Castle of Keys is an interactive, real-world access control game inspired by medieval castles and powered by externalized authorization using Permit.io.

The player presents an RFID card to the reader connected to the ESP32.

Project Overview: Student Course Management System
Students
Courses
Instructors
Enrollments and Grades
Step 1: Designing the Database Schema
students
student_id (PK)
first_name, last_name, email, date_of_birth
instructors
instructor_id (PK)
first_name, last_name, email
courses
course_id (PK)
course_name, description, instructor_id (FK)
enrollments
enrollment_id (PK)
student_id, course_id (FKs)
enrollment_date, grade
Schema Lesson:
Step 2: Populating the Database
10 students
3 instructors
5 courses
15 enrollments with grades
This gave me a realistic dataset to work with in the next step queries!
Step 3: Writing Real-World SQL Queries
Students who enrolled in at least one course:
SELECT DISTINCT s.first_name, s.last_name
Students enrolled in more than two courses:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, COUNT(e.course_id) AS course_count
Courses with number of enrolled students:
SELECT c.course_name, COUNT(e.student_id) AS total_students
Average grade per course:
SELECT c.course_name,
Top 3 students by average grade:
SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name,
SQL Lessons:
Use CASE statements for custom logic like grade conversion.
JOIN is your best friend for combining data across tables.
GROUP BY + HAVING is essential for filtering aggregates.
Step 5: Hosting on GitHub
SQL scripts
README.md with setup instructions
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
GitHub link: https://github.com/KELVINNDIRANGU/SQL-PROJECT-2



Key Learnings
Schema Design matters normalize wisely.
Foreign Keys keep your data sane.
Views simplify repeated queries.
Triggers help with automation and audit logging.
Indexing is crucial for performance as your data grows.
Conclusion
This project transformed how I view SQL not as a list of commands, but as a tool to build real, functional systems. Whether you're preparing for a job, managing data, or automating reports, SQL is foundational.]]></summary>

As a Java developer with ten years of professional experience, I rarely need AI support. Here, AI serves more as a sparring partner to validate ideas or make small optimizations.
In the frontend domain, however, it’s a different story. My knowledge is much more limited in this area, so I rely heavily on AI, often as a near-complete code generator rather than just for small snippets. This makes me feel productive while actively learning – my willingness to learn is high here. I often ask the AI why something works the way it does.
When it comes to PowerShell scripts, my interest completely fades. I’m not even willing to learn this language. Instead, I let the AI generate entire scripts and appreciate that it takes this work off my plate. The complexity is usually mana…]]></summary>

Log into the VM using Virtual Machine Manager.
To set up Virtual Machine Manager, follow this guide from my ongoing series: KVM setup on Fedora
Once the setup is complete, search for “Virtual Machine Manager” in your system’s search bar. Open the app, “run” the VM by selecting your server, and click on “Open”. This will launch your Fedora QEMU/KVM console.

useRef Ne İşe Yarar?


useRef, komponentin yeniden render edilmesini tetiklemeyen bir "değer tutucu" sağlar. Bu, bir değeri "saklamak" anlamına gelir, ama bu değer değiştiğinde UI yeniden render edilmez. Genellikle DOM referanslarına erişmek veya bir değişkeni render döngüsüne etki etmeden saklamak için kullanılır.
Bir okul sınıfı düşün. Bu sınıfta öğretmen (React komponenti) var. Öğretmenin tahtada yazdığı her şey (UI) çok önemli, çünkü öğrenciler (kullanıcılar) bunu görerek öğreniyorlar.
useState öğretmenin tahta üzerine yazdığı yazıları ifade eder. Öğretmen her yazıyı değiştirdiğinde, öğrenciler buna bakacak ve öğrencilerin sınıfta başka işlere başlaması için tahta (UI) yeniden yazılacaktır.

This isn’t just about immersive gameplay, it’s about helping players understand how sustainability works through simulation. Whether used in a survival game, an educational tool, or a training environment, this model encourages critical thinking about natural systems and human impact.
Forests as Active Systems
If players or AI chop too many trees without replanting, the forest becomes unhealthy — reducing future wood output and halting wildlife spawns. Reforestation is possible, but slow. Trees take in-game weeks to mature, which encourages foresight and planning rather than constant exploitation.
Wildlife Populations Tied to Habitat
From Ecosystem to Economy
Educational Potential
Conclusion
By linking forest health, wildlife populations, and economic decisions into a single system, this simulation helps players feel the weight of environmental balance.
It’s not a warning, it’s a mirror. And it shows that even in a fantasy world, the rules of sustainability still apply.
As I continue developing this platform, my goal is to make it not just a game, but a tool — one that blends play, purpose, and ecological insight.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction
In my latest simulation project, I’ve developed an emotional AI system where characters experience daily happiness, long-term memories, and evolving relationships. These aren’t scripted cutscenes — they emerge from each character’s traits, interactions, and lived experience.
This kind of system isn't just innovative for games — it has far-reaching potential in education, social training, and digital human modelling. By giving AI characters the ability to remember, reflect, and react emotionally, we can begin to simulate the complexity of human Behavior.
Every AI character starts each day with a base happiness score. This score adjusts based on events: social encounters, weather, threats, or work satisfaction. But how they interpret those events depends on their personality traits.
For example:
Memory-Driven Relationships
These memories are stored, referenced, and updated — influencing how they speak, act, or even decide where to live. One AI might form a deep friendship. Another may quietly resent a rival.
Systems like these could help:
Instead of scripting every possible interaction, this approach lets AI learn and grow organically, mimicking how humans form feelings over time.
Emotion and memory in AI are not just about realism, they’re about meaning. When virtual characters reflect the psychological nuances of real people, players connect more deeply, and systems become more powerful.
This project has shown me how valuable emotion-based AI systems can be, not just in games, but as tools for social modelling, education, and training. I’m continuing to develop and expand this work, with the goal of building intelligent, emotionally aware systems that can inform, challenge, and engage people in entirely new ways.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a world increasingly impacted by climate change and environmental degradation, there’s a growing need to make ecological education engaging, interactive, and deeply felt. One powerful and often overlooked tool for this is: games.
As both a developer and systems designer, I’ve spent the past year building a game that does more than just entertain, it teaches players how ecosystems really work. Not through lectures or text, but through consequences.
In my simulation, forests are living systems. Trees grow slowly, and each forest has a measurable "health" score that reflects the balance between mature trees, saplings, and destruction. Destroy too much, and the forest deteriorates. Let it recover, and wildlife returns. Players can choose to assign AI foresters to replant trees or exploit the forest and suffer resource collapse.
Wild animals, like rabbits and deer, depend on forest health. Their populations rise and fall based on available habitat. Overhunting or deforestation can drive local extinction, and once they’re gone, they’re gone. There’s no magical respawn. Just like in the real world, regrowth takes time, and sustainability requires foresight.
The goal isn’t to punish players, it’s to show them what happens when short-term survival clashes with long-term environmental stability. It’s a lesson better felt than taught.
What excites me is the potential for systems like these to go beyond games:
As classroom tools for science and geography teachers
As simulations for environmental education programs
As accessible platforms for young players to understand complex systems like reforestation, overhunting, and biodiversity collapse

We need more tools that help people internalize ecological cause and effect, not just read about it. Games, especially those with rich simulation mechanics, are a perfect fit.
If you're working in education, sustainability, or simulation, I’d love to connect. There’s a lot more potential to explore at the intersection of game design and environmental learning.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the domain of software design, the way data is modeled significantly impacts the clarity, robustness, and scalability of an application. As systems evolve and become increasingly complex, the need for clear domain boundaries and well-encapsulated behavior becomes essential.
This is where Rich Domain Objects (RDO) offer a compelling solution. RDOs advocate for encapsulating both state and behavior within domain entities, thereby promoting a more cohesive and maintainable architecture.
In this article, we will explore the concept of Rich Domain Objects, their benefits, and how they can be effectively implemented in Java using a practical, real-world example. By the end, you will gain a deeper understanding of this approach and walk away with testable, production-ready code.

Have you ever wanted to build your own widget in Elementor using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without creating a WordPress plugin?
Currently, building a custom widget in Elementor requires writing PHP, registering it with WordPress, and deploying it via plugin. For many frontend developers, this creates a barrier.
Elementor is a powerful visual builder, but when it comes to adding custom functionality (like animations, dynamic components, or third-party APIs), you're limited to embedding code in HTML widgets — and even then, it's clunky and lacks structure.
What if Elementor had a built-in Custom Widget Editor?
Code editor tabs for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Live preview inside the panel
Save & reuse custom widgets across projects
Export to plugin or Elementor template
Syntax highlighting and basic linting
Aimed at power users, it would bring the experience of CodePen or JSFiddle directly into the Elementor UI.
Here’s a quick visual mockup of how it could look:

I’ve shared this idea in the official Elementor GitHub Discussions:

If you're a developer, designer, or part of the Elementor team and this idea resonates with you — I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Thanks for reading, and happy building!

There’s a saying:  
“Every plan is perfect until you get punched in the face.”
In software, that punch often comes the moment your pure logic has to interact with the real world.
In our last post, we built a clean, composable model for events — one based on transformations, ownership, and simplicity. But so far, everything has been pure. We transform values, we log them, we react — but we haven’t changed anything.
That changes now.
Let’s take this innocent-looking example:
const [onEvent, emitEvent] = createEvent()
onEvent(() => console.log(state()))
onEvent(() => setState("world"))
onEvent(() => console.log(state()))

What should this log?
"hello" and then "world"?
"world" twice?

While building a personal SaaS app focused on music streaming, I ran into a common issue: there's no starter template for media-heavy SaaS platforms in the Next.js ecosystem.
We have great examples for blogs, e-commerce, and dashboards — but nothing geared toward apps like Spotify, YouTube, Bandcamp, etc.
A starter template (official or community-built) that helps developers quickly build music or video-based SaaS platforms, including:
Modular layout (admin dashboard + public site)
SSR-compatible media player
YouTube/Spotify API integration
Auth system (for creators and users)
Stripe billing setup
Media upload via Cloudinary, Bunny, or UploadThing
Streaming SaaS apps always repeat the same core features — authentication, content dashboards, media playback, etc.
Having a purpose-built starter would:
Save developers a lot of time
Reduce duplicated effort
Make Next.js even more attractive for startup and indie devs
I’ve shared this idea on GitHub Discussions to get feedback from the community.

Here’s also a simple wireframe mockup of the concept:

Signals have gone through a quiet renaissance.
Once a niche concept, they’ve become the backbone of fine-grained reactivity across modern frameworks — from SolidJS to Svelte 5, Vue’s Composition API, and beyond. With laziness, ownership, batching, and async support, signals are no longer just state — they’re a reactive architecture.
Meanwhile, events have stayed… familiar.

Push-based systems like RxJS still dominate, with powerful abstractions — and plenty of baggage. They’re expressive, but complex. Powerful, but leaky.
This series explores a different direction:

What if we evolved events the way signals evolved?

What if push and pull reactivity didn’t require different paradigms, just different shapes?

Welcome 👋 to this blog. If you want to learn about Docker and are a beginner, you have come to the right place. This blog series will cover everything from the very beginning to the end. This blog will teach us about the necessary and important Docker commands.
$ docker ps

Note: If the Docker commands are not running in your system, it is not installed or does not have enough privileges to use it with sudo commands.
$ docker ps -all

Step 1: Create a container
$ docker container create hello-world:linux

Here, hello-world:linux is a hello world container image which is pulled from the docker hub
Step 2: Start the container
$ docker container start <Container ID>

Here,  is the container ID which can be obtained by running the previous commands docker ps.
$ docker run hello-world:linux

docker run = docker container create + docker container start + docker container attach
$ docker log <Container ID>

$ docker exec <Conatiner ID> <Commands>

$ docker exec --interactive --tty <Container ID>

$ docker stop -t <ID>

$ docker rm <Container ID>

$ docker images

$ docker rmi <Image ID>

$ docker rmi -f <Image ID>

$ docker run -p 5001:5000 our-server

$ docker tag <Local-image-name> username/your-image-name:0.0.01

In this blog, we explored different commands of Docker containers, images, emphasising their roles in container & image creation. In the next blog, we will delve deeper into the technical aspects. Stay tuned

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[📊 Machine learning is about using data to make smart predictions or decisions. 
But other fields (like statistics or psychology) also work with data, so how they are different than Machine Learning ❓
And the correct answer is - ✅ their goals are different.
To understand it much more clearly let me give an example:
🌻 Imagine you have a garden.
You notice some flowers are growing really big, and some are small. Now you're curious - why are some flowers bigger than others?
📈 In Statistics:
You count how much 🌊 water, ☀️ sunlight, and 🌱 fertilizer each flower got.
“Ah! When I give more water, flowers grow bigger!”
You make a rule (a model) to explain what makes the flowers grow.
"why" here is:
“Because they got more water and sunlight.”
So you create a model to explain the relationship — you’re interested in the why.
✅ Goal: Understand the cause behind the outcome.
🧠 In Psychology:
Let’s say you're studying how your friend feels.
When your friend doesn't sleep, they get cranky 😠.
You ask:
“Why is my friend cranky today?”
And you think:
“Maybe it’s because they didn’t sleep well 😴.”
So you're trying to find the real reason behind feelings or behavior.
“Because they didn’t sleep.”
You try to find the real reason behind their feelings or behavior.
✅ Goal: Understand human emotions and behavior — again, the why.
🤖 In Machine Learning:
You give the computer LOTS of examples:
How much water each flower got 💧.


How big it grew 🌼



The computer learns to guess flower size just by looking at water and sunlight —  but it doesn’t really know why. 
It just learns to make good guesses.
“Why is this flower big?”
It might say:
“I don’t know, but I saw something like this before, and it turned out big.”
✅ Goal: Make accurate predictions, even if it doesn’t understand why.
So, the goal is the key difference in Machine learning vs Others (like statistics or psychology).
✨ Machine Learning is less about explaining why something happens and more about guessing what will happen next, based on patterns in data.]]></summary>

So, why should you care about messages in the first place?
They are the foundation of how chat models communicate. Messages carry the what, who, and how of a conversation. Without understanding them, you're essentially flying blind. But once you do, you gain precise control over your model's behavior, clarity in structuring your prompts, and flexibility when building more advanced workflows.

I don’t want to scare you, but someone on Twitter said that “most jobs will become obsolete” in less than 10 years. McKinsey agrees (they say AI Agents will replace 70% of office work), and Goldman, too.
So, I guess our clock is ticking. We don’t have much time. It’s probably better to take a woodworking course or something similar.

But I am not that good at woodworking. So, let’s try to understand how AI Agents work and if they are that scary.
If you read Twitter or Linkedin, AI Agents look like special agents that can do everything. The demos that they share look amazing.

However, these agents don’t feel that special when you use them. They are helpfu…]]></summary>

I'm Dmitry, the creator of Sury—the fastest schema library out there. If you’re a fan of Zod (and who isn’t?), you’ll want to read this. Today, I want to share some surprising findings about Zod v4’s performance, what it means for you, and how to avoid the pitfalls.
Let’s start with a little clickbait:

Zod v4 became 17 times slower, and nobody noticed 🙈
This is 100% true, but of course, that’s not the whole story. Let’s dig in.
Recently, while prepping for the big Sury v10 release, I decided to rerun my benchmarks with Zod v4. The results? Fascinating.
For a non-trivial schema, Zod v4 is now 8x faster than before.
But when you create a schema and use it just once (a common pattern in React components), performance drops significantly—down to about 6 ops/ms.
You might thi…]]></summary>

Over the years, a few MB have accumulated and at some point I had to think about where to put them in order to keep the size of the blog under 1GB. Outsourcing to YouTube?

According to the official definition on the website:
MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C offers a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.
Quickly, other players began announcing support for this new protocol:

So I spun up a bare Ubuntu VPS, installed NGINX, and started learning everything the hard (but rewarding) way.
Why WordPress on a VPS?
No bloat: I wanted a clean, fast stack — no unnecessary plugins or GUIs.
More control: From PHP version to rewrite rules, I wanted to tweak everything myself.
Cheaper in the long run: VPS plans are affordable and scale well.
Stack Setup (The Barebones Way)
I’m running:
Ubuntu 22.04

They build a product — then try to find customers.
I’m trying the opposite. I launched a landing page first, and immediately started testing demand with paid ads — even before writing a single line of code.
Building a product takes time.
And if nobody wants it... all that effort is wasted.
Instead of waiting until launch, I want answers early:
Are people searching for this kind of product?
Will they click?
Will they leave a lead?
How much will it cost me to get one?
What I did:
Built a simple landing page on Framer in one day
Set up a €20 test budget on Google Ads
Created a form to collect early leads
Tracked everything manually — no complex funnel yet
I made a mistake 😅
600 useless clicks later, I paused the campaign.
Second try: ✅
High-intent keywords
Simple ad copy
No display, no video, no smart automation
The result? Lower traffic — but real, relevant visitors. And a few leads.
Even with €10–20, I got signal:
People are searching for this
I’m getting a few signups
And I can start estimating my customer acquisition cost
This will help me decide:
Is this idea worth building?
What pricing makes sense?
What channels work best?
Next steps
(Hint: talk to them — don’t ghost them.)

Sometimes, especially when I moved the mouse at a high speed, none of the tabs appeared to be hovered. The highlight vanished. It was as if my mouse had exited all the elements, even though it was clearly moving over them.

  ⛓️ String formatting and interpolation


The first way that people often learn to join values and strings is the concatenating method:
words = "5"
concat_str = "This string has " + words + " words"

However, this method is not very readable and doesn't work on many languages.
Interpolated strings are a way of combinating variables and fixed strings in a more visual way, which can help code insight and debugging.
The next three ways are much better and have some useful particularities:
f-strings (my favourite)

Difficulty: Medium
Topics: Array, Greedy
In a row of dominoes, tops[i] and bottoms[i] represent the top and bottom halves of the ith domino. (A domino is a tile with two numbers from 1 to 6 - one on each half of the tile.)
We may rotate the ith domino, so that tops[i] and bottoms[i] swap values.
Return the minimum number of rotations so that all the values in tops are the same, or all the values in bottoms are the same.
If it cannot be done, return -1.
Example 1:

Input: tops = [2,1,2,4,2,2], bottoms = [5,2,6,2,3,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: The first figure represents the dominoes as given by tops and bottoms: before we do any rotations.


If we rotate the second and fourth dominoes, we can make every value in the top row equal to 2, as indicated …]]></summary>

One of the MOST important rules in automation is having independent tests. This means tests should not rely on each other and you should be able to run any test from any suite at any time. 
In this blog post, I am sharing some proven practices I've picked up over a decade in test automation. Cypress is used for the demos, but the concepts apply to any test automation stack.
Special thanks to @Sebastian Clavijo Suero for his great feedback and suggestions! 
⚠️ Disclaimer: The techniques and practices shared in this article are based on real-world experience across multiple projects and teams. While they’ve worked well for me and many others, they’re not the only way to approach test isolation, and I’m not claiming these are the best approaches.

The Bitcoin (BTC) mining industry has never been more attractive to institutional investors. Fintech giants are investing in Bitcoin mining rather than just accumulating the asset, all thanks to the favorable regulatory environment in the US and the profitability margin of BTC. 
Then, numerous companies are diversifying by allocating computing power to AI, further strengthening their economics and, thus, investment attractiveness. For now, it looks like the future of the foundational layer for the Bitcoin network could mark the new gusher age.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Want to build Python desktop applications? wxPython is a great choice!
In this guide, we’ll go through:
Installing wxPython
Creating a simple window
Adding buttons and handling events
To get started, install wxPython:
pip install wxPython

Here's a basic wxPython window:
import wx

app = wx.App(False)
frame = wx.Frame(None, wx.ID_ANY, "Hello wxPython!", size=(300, 200))
frame.Show(True)
app.MainLoop()

A basic window titled “Hello wxPython!” will appear.
Let's add a button and show a message when it's clicked:
import wx

class MyFrame(wx.Frame):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(None, title="wxPython Button Example", size=(300, 200))
        panel = wx.Panel(self)

        self.button = wx.Button(panel, label="Click Me", pos=(100, 50))
        self.button.Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON, self.on_click)

    def on_click(self, event):
        wx.MessageBox("You clicked the button!", "Info", wx.OK | wx.ICON_INFORMATION)

app = wx.App(False)
frame = MyFrame()
frame.Show()
app.MainLoop()

wxPython is a powerful and flexible way to create cross-platform desktop apps using Python.

description: "From floating-point quirks to BigInt, learn how numbers really work in JavaScript with examples and best practices."
JavaScript is a powerful and flexible language, but its handling of numbers can be a bit quirky—especially if you're coming from languages like Python or Java. In this article, we’ll break down how numbers work in JavaScript — from basic arithmetic to edge cases you should know.
In JavaScript, all numbers are stored as floating-point values, even if they look like integers.
console.log(typeof 10);       // "number"
console.log(typeof 10.5);     // "number"

JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format.

console.log(a + b); // 7
console.log(a - b); // 3

It's highly flexible and covers lots of great features, which saves hours of work.
If you want to dive into theme development, this could be a great contribution for the community.
However, it's easy to miss critical concepts if you don't spend enough time learning how to do it right.
Hugo is a framework, so it has its specificity.
It's impossible to cover everything here, but, roughly speaking, many templates will inherit from generic structures, so you can prevent unnecessary duplication (e.g., HTML markup) just by defining blocks and using hooks:

Every AWS developer has been there: you need to download an entire S3 folder structure containing thousands of files, and suddenly you're faced with a frustrating reality—AWS doesn't provide a simple way to do this at scale.
You could:
👆 Click through the AWS Console manually (impossible for large folders)
🖥️ Learn and configure the AWS CLI (with its own quirks and limitations)
🔨 Build a custom solution (which inevitably becomes a project in itself)
This challenge becomes particularly acute when dealing with data archives containing tens of thousands of files or datasets measuring in the tens or hundreds of gigabytes. Many organizations resort to inefficient workarounds or accept the operational bottleneck.

The truth is simple: you don't need AWS to build something users love.
There is a common trap that builders fall into. You read a few blog posts or see a diagram on Twitter and suddenly you think your tiny project needs the same architecture as Netflix.
You don’t.

Dependency Injection (DI) is a concept so deeply ingrained in everyday programming practices that ignoring it could almost be considered a cardinal sin, on par with neglecting version control. But why has DI become so crucial?
DI is one of the key principles enabling the creation of flexible and maintainable applications. The philosophy behind it revolves around freeing code from unnecessary details that tightly couple logical components. Components no longer depend on specific implementations of other parts of the system—they simply declare their needs, and DI provides the required dependencies.
The goal here is not just to master a trendy technology but to explore a universal architectural tool whose concepts transcend different ecosystems. Studying DI across multiple lang…]]></summary>

This comes amid an overall decline in interest in the onchain creator economy and a changing perspective on whether blockchain tools like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are still useful for creatives who want to monetize their work on the blockchain.

Google Online Assessment (OA) for the Summer Internship 2025 is a crucial part of the hiring process. This assessment tests your coding skills, problem-solving abilities, and your aptitude for tackling complex algorithms. One of the typical problems you might encounter is transforming a number into a palindromic binary form with the least number of operations. In this blog, we will delve into this problem and provide strategies to solve it efficiently.

You are given a number ( N ) (0 <= ( N ) <= 2 * 10^9), and you can perform the following operation any number of times, including zero:
Increase or decrease the number by 1.
Your task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the binary form of ( N ) palindromic.

Too often, data engineering tasks that should be simple end up requiring heavyweight tools. Something breaks, or I need to explore a new dataset, and suddenly I’m firing up Spark or connecting to a cloud warehouse - even though the data easily fits on my laptop. That adds extra steps, slows things down, and costs more than it should. I wanted something simpler for local analytics that could still handle serious queries.
DuckDB is an open-source, in-process SQL OLAP database designed for analytics.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building containerized applications with Docker, one common frustration developers face is the lack of live updates when editing code. For example, you tweak server.js or a front-end file, but the changes don’t reflect in the running app. Why?
Because Docker copies your project files into the container when you build the image. Once the container starts, it runs on that static snapshot—isolated from your host file system.
Restarting the container every time you make a change? That’s inefficient.
Enter: Bind Mounts.
Bind mounts allow you to map a file or directory on your host machine to a path inside your running container.
This means:
Your container reads real-time code from your host.
You can make live changes on your local system, and see them reflected instantly inside your contai…]]></summary>

From initial coin offerings (ICOs) to fair launches and airdrops, each approach carries different levels of transparency, accessibility and risk. Since projects differ in their goals and target communities, several token launch models have evolved over time.

To avoid conflicts or malformed entries, let’s clean up any existing Docker repository files:
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list
sudo rm -f /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

Ensure your system has the necessary tools:
sudo apt-get update

The -y flag automatically confirms the installation.
This step ensures curl and gnupg are available for fetching and processing the GPG key.

Agora, sua equipe precisa integrar uma nova forma de pagamento, como PayPal, desenvolvida por outra squad ou vinda de uma biblioteca de terceiros. Essa classe PayPal não implementa a interface Pagamento, e isso quebraria o padrão da sua aplicação.
Para resolver esse problema sem modificar a biblioteca externa (o que muitas vezes nem é possível), usamos o padrão Adapter, que atua como um "tradutor" entre as interfaces. Ele faz com que a classe PayPal seja compatível com a interface Pagame…]]></summary>

You’ve updated your systems. Applied patches. Everything seems fine.
But no system can be truly secure or efficient without ongoing monitoring.
No logs = No alerts = delayed response to attacks or resource exhaustion

No visibility means attackers could go unnoticed (e.g., unauthorized SSH access)

Unpatched systems or performance spikes might indicate compromise but without monitoring, you'd never know.

The TCP 3-Way Handshake is a fundamental process that establishes a reliable connection between two devices over a TCP/IP network. It involves three steps: SYN (Synchronize), SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge), and ACK (Acknowledge). During the handshake, the client and server exchange initial sequence numbers and confirm the connection establishment.  
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a foundational internet protocol designed to:
reliably (no lost or duplicated packets)

✅ Ensure in-order delivery (packets arrive in the order they were sent)

✅ Provide error-checking (detect and fix corrupted data)
Unlike UDP (which just throws data out, hoping it arrives), TCP carefully sets up, manages, and closes connections.

In today’s world of software development, clarity and maintainability are more valuable than ever. Functional programming (FP) — once considered an academic curiosity — is now a widely used paradigm in real-world applications. But what exactly is functional programming, and why should you care?
Let’s break it down.
Functional programming is a way of thinking about software construction that treats computation as the evaluation of pure functions and avoids changing state or using mutable data.
Rather than telling the computer how to do something (like in imperative programming), you describe what you want done. This leads to predictable, testable, and often more compact code.
A pure function:

But why? Because building a resume depends on multiple factors, like who you are, what job you are applying for, and what the company is looking for.
You can't simply create a resume and then send it to 100+ companies on LinkedIn.
And when you finally sit down to specifically write one, you get tons of questions like:
Should I use a template or build from scratch?
How do I format it?
Do I need to add all my achievements and create a one- or two-page resume?
Will this even pass through the ATS?
This is where AI resume builders are helpful, as they are trained on numerous professional resumes to help you create one according to your requirements.

What is a color-shifting hover card?
A color-shifting hover card is a type of hover effect that changes the background color of a card or element when the user hovers over it. It is a fun and interactive way to add some visual interest to your website or app. The effect is achieved by using CSS gradients and JavaScript to update the card's background color based on the user's cursor position. You can obviously use solid colors instead of gradients, but gradients are more versatile and can be used for more complex effects…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[💰 Cost Optimization with AWS Compute Optimizer.
“You can’t optimize what you don’t measure.” — This quote holds especially true in the cloud.
In this blog, I’ll walk you through what Compute Optimizer is, how it works, and how I used it in a real-world project to save money without compromising performance.
🔍 What is AWS Compute Optimizer?
EC2 instances
⚙️ How Compute Optimizer Works
Go to the AWS Console.
🧪 Real-World Use Case: Cost Cutting with EC2
We had 6 EC2 instances of type t3.large in a production environment. These handled various microservices with relatively low average usage but had burst workloads occasionally.
Compute Optimizer Analysis:
CPU utilization: <10% average
Switch to t3.medium
We used this migration strategy:
Create AMI backups
No increase in latency
🛑 Things to Keep in Mind
Is this instance intentionally over-provisioned? (e.g., for redundancy or DR)
📦 What About EBS and Lambda?
We had a general-purpose gp2 volume attached to our dev environment with almost no IO requirements.
Compute Optimizer suggested sc1 (cold HDD), and we tested it for archive-type workloads.
✅ Result: No functional issues, 60% storage cost saved.
Lambda
In a different project, our Lambda functions had 1024MB memory allocated by default. Compute Optimizer showed average usage around 200MB.
We lowered to 512MB, which also reduced the timeout rate and improved cold-start behavior.
📊 How to Track the Savings
Use AWS Cost Explorer to monitor actual savings
AWS Trusted Advisor → checks for idle load balancers, unused IPs, etc.
🔚 Final Thoughts

Text-to-speech has come a long way from the robotic voices of the past. Today's TTS technology can produce remarkably natural-sounding speech that's nearly indistinguishable from human voices. But for many users, access to high-quality voice synthesis has meant wrestling with complex interfaces or limited options.
What if you could have studio-quality voice synthesis right in your terminal? What if converting text to speech was as simple as typing a single command? That's exactly what Kokoro TTS delivers.
In this post, we'll explore the world of natural text-to-speech, why command-line tools make sense for voice synthesis, and introduce you to Kokoro TTS, a powerful CLI tool that brings professional-grade voice s…]]></summary>

I created a command-line automation script using Amazon Q Developer that sets up a full project boilerplate in just seconds.
It helps developers bootstrap new projects with:
✅ README.md
✅ MIT LICENSE
✅ .gitignore
✅ src/main.py with a starter message
✅ Git initialized and first commit made
This is super useful for quickly starting new CLI-based tools or apps.
Crushing the Command Line
I used q chat to prompt Amazon Q Developer CLI with this instruction:

What began as a simple idea evolved through multiple iterations—each one teaching me something about technology, process, and the nature of entrepreneurship itself. This is the story of that journey—from Katacoding to Sigmacasts to Octal Stream—and the insights I gained along the way.
The concept began with Katacoding, a platform offering live, one-on-one online coding lessons via video calls. While the model had promise, it lacked scalability. That realization led to Sigmacasts, a curated series of educational videos on math and computer science. The production process taught me how to craft educational narratives and use video to communicate abstract ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made incredible strides in understanding and generating human language. From chatbots to virtual assistants, AI-powered tools can mimic human conversation, provide customer support, and even write articles. However, despite these advancements, AI will never fully capture human communication. Why? Because human language is deeply rooted in emotions, cultural contexts, creativity, and nuances that AI struggles to grasp.
This Blog explores the key differences between AI-generated language and human communication, highlighting why AI will always fall short of replicating human interaction entirely.
The Complexity of Human Language
Understand sarcasm and irony.
AI Lacks Emotional Intelligence:  AI vs. Human Emotions
Empathy in conversations.
Creativity and Storytelling: A Human-Only Domain
AI cannot create original ideas.
The Power of Personal Experiences Human Storytelling vs. AI
The Role of Cultural and Social Influences
Keep up with new trends in language.
The Importance of Human Connection AI vs. Human Communication
Body language and facial expressions.
Unintended discrimination in responses.
Lack of inclusivity in AI-generated content.
Conclusion:
AI has revolutionized language processing, but it cannot replace human communication. Our ability to connect emotionally, create original stories, and adapt language based on context makes human interaction irreplaceable.

I’ve just wrapped up Week 1 of my DevOps journey, and let me tell you — it was an exciting, sometimes confusing, but deeply satisfying start. If you're also starting out with DevOps or curious about how to begin, I hope my experience helps you learn (or avoid) a few things.
Here’s what I covered this week, what tripped me up, how I solved it, and a few useful insights for fellow beginners 👇
☁️ What I Learned This Week
What is Cloud Computing?
I finally got a grip on the difference between:
IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): Where you rent virtual hardware (like AWS EC2).
PaaS (Platform as a Service): Managed app platforms (like Heroku).
SaaS (Software as a Service): Apps delivered over the internet (like Google Docs).

“This post will describe how Ethereum 5 years from now can become close to as simple as Bitcoin,” Buterin wrote, arguing that simplicity is key to Ethereum’s resilience and long-term scalability.

Introduction: kubernetes’ package manager dilemma
If you’ve deployed anything non-trivial on Kubernetes, you’ve probably been blessed (read: cursed) by Helm. For years, Helm has been the default package manager for Kubernetes apps. Charts, releases, values.yaml, and enough curly braces to give you PTSD. It’s the duct tape that somehow holds your YAML together.
But like every DevOps tool we worship and then meme to death, Helm has started showing its age. What once felt like a brilliant abstraction now sometimes feels like writing YAML that generates YAML to apply more YAML. It’s powerful sure but can also feel like overengineering disguised as a templating solution.

Back in August 2020, Epic Games added its own way to pay inside Fortnite, skipping Apple’s built-in payment system. This broke Apple’s App Store rules, so Apple removed Fortnite from the store. In response, Epic sued Apple, saying the company had too much monopoly and was stopping fair competition.
The courtroom drama went over several years:
September 2021: A judge ruled that Apple was mostly right, but one of its rules—stopping developers from telling users about other payment options—was unfair under California law. Apple had to let developers share links to other ways to pay.


April 2025: The court said Apple broke that rule again. Even after the 2021 order, Apple still charged a 27% fee on outside payments and made it hard for developers to show other payment opt…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today’s fast-moving digital landscape, Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents are no longer just tools—they’re decision-makers, collaborators, and even strategists. But as these systems grow more autonomous and complex, a pressing question arises: Do we truly understand how AI thinks, learns, and evolves?
The evolving behavior of AI agents isn’t just a technical curiosity—it’s a critical business risk that leaders must monitor closely. In this article, we’ll dive deep into the inner workings of AI agents, explore how their behavior can shift over time, and what that means for businesses across industries.
What Are AI Agents, Really?
Unlike traditional software, AI agents learn and adapt. This ability, while powerful, can lead to unpredictable behaviors, especially as agents interact with new data or collaborate with other agents in a shared system.
The Evolution of AI Behavior: A Double-Edged Sword
Examples of Evolving AI Behavior:
Bias amplification: Over time, AI models may reinforce and amplify hidden biases in training data.
Unexpected strategy development: AI agents in competitive environments (e.g., simulations, financial markets) may develop unanticipated strategies that break norms or ethical boundaries.
These evolving behaviors can introduce operational, ethical, and reputational risks if not properly understood and controlled.
Why Business Leaders Should Care
Autonomy Can Create Blind Spots


Unpredictability Increases Risk Exposure


Regulations Are Coming



Strategies to Manage AI Behavioral Risk
✅ AI Explainability
✅ Continuous Monitoring
✅ Ethical AI Governance
✅ Simulation & Testing
The Future: Human-AI Collaboration with Guardrails
The question is no longer “What can AI do?” but “What is my AI actually doing—and why?”
Conclusion
🔍 Stay informed, stay prepared. The more we understand AI behavior, the safer—and smarter—our future becomes.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building a large-scale Java and Angular application on AWS, we must consider security at every layer from the underlying AWS infrastructure to the application code.
Here are some best practices - 
1. Identity and Access Management (IAM) with Least Privilege
Best Practice: Adopt a strict least privilege approach with our IAM policies. Assign users, roles, and services only the permissions they require, and enforce role-based access control (RBAC).
Examples:
Do not use root credentials for everyday tasks. Instead, create IAM roles for our services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) and assign specific policies.
Policy Example:

Real-Time Scenario: In a large-scale environment, our Java backend might run on an EC2 fleet or containers in ECS/EKS. By assigning each instance a dedicated IAM role with …]]></summary>

nil in the Go Language


In the practice of Go language programming, the use of nil is extremely common. For example, the default type is assigned as nil, the error return value often uses return nil, and multiple types use if != nil for judgment, etc. However, regarding the knowledge point of nil, developers need to have an in-depth understanding of its essence and related characteristics. This article will comprehensively analyze nil around the following core questions:
Is nil a keyword, a type, or a variable?
Which types can use the != nil syntax?
What are the similarities and differences in the interaction between different types and nil?
Why do some composite structures need make(Type) to be used after defining variables?

Now we don't write verbose class-based components anymore. Over the years, the React team has introduced a ton of built-in hooks that solve specific problems.
But most of the people only stick with just useState() and useEffect(). But there are a lot of hooks that can improve your understanding and ability to write efficient code. As an experienced developer of React, I have tried to explain each of the advanced & newly introduced hooks with proper real-world code examples. Let's build the best app together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The difference between @RestController and @Controller in Spring Framework lies mainly in how they handle HTTP responses.
@Controller




Used for: Traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) web applications.
Returns: Usually returns a View (like JSP, Thymeleaf, etc.).
ResponseBody: If you want to return JSON/XML instead of a view, you must use @ResponseBody on the method.
Example:
@Controller
public class MyController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "hello";  // returns a view named "hello"
    }

    @GetMapping("/api")
    @ResponseBody
    public String api() {
        return "This is JSON or plain text";
    }
}

@RestController




Used for: RESTful web services (APIs).
Returns: Automatically returns JSON or XML responses.
Behavior: It is a convenience annotation that combines @Controller and @ResponseBody. So every method returns the body directly, not a view.
Example:
@RestController
public class MyRestController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello, REST!";  // returns as JSON or plain text
    }
}




Feature
@Controller
@RestController




Returns View?
Yes (by default)
No


JSON/XML by default?
No (@ResponseBody needed)
Yes


Use case
Web UI applications
REST APIs


Combines with
@ResponseBody
Already includes @ResponseBody]]></summary>

What if your SaaS application could detect a cyberattack, recover from it, and keep running — without human help?
In this post, I’ll walk you through building a self-healing SaaS architecture using Django + Frappe, combining security automation, error detection, and real-time remediation — all in one stack.
Traditional SaaS platforms rely on:
Manual monitoring
Reactive fixes
Delayed recovery
In a world of zero-day threats and real-time exploits, this isn't enough.
A self-healing SaaS:

✅ Blocks malicious behavior

✅ Automatically restores services

✅ Notifies only when necessary  



Component
Purpose




Django
Core backend & API logic


Frappe
Metadata-based UI, DocTypes, and permissions


Celery + Redis
Background async healing tasks


Fail2Ban / UFW
Auto-blocking IP threats


Middleware
Attack detection & real-time interception


Audit Logs
Track incidents & healing cycles



Brute Force Login Attack



Middleware detects 5+ login failures from same IP

Stores event in logs

Triggers healing Celery task

Automatically:


Blocks IP via Fail2Ban/UFW

Restarts login module if crashed

Sends healing status alert
⏱️ Total recovery time: < 3 seconds

👤 Human involvement: 0
🔐 Auto-heal authentication abuse

🚫 IP blocking on attack detection

🧰 Restart crashed worker queues (Celery)

🔄 Fix broken DocType workflows

📈 Live dashboards for threat metrics







  
  
  💡 Key Takeaways



Self-healing is not just a trend, it's the future of cyber-resilient platforms.
Django + Frappe offer the perfect balance of flexibility, automation, and observability.
You’re not just building features—you’re building defense mechanisms into the fabric of your product.

Let’s build smarter. Let’s build securely.

A streaming platform wants to stream sport matches commented in English (of course completely legal) for Vietnamese viewers. They demand that the subtitle needed to be translated to Vietnamese with the lowest latency as possible. This blog is a PoC (Proof of Concept) for the translated streaming subtitle, using AWS Transcribe to transcribe the voice to text, Nova Micro to fix the text and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock to translate, with the support of serverless AWS ECS Fargate and Lambda.
Why not using Amazon Translate but use Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 in Bedrock? It is because the streaming videos are in special contexts, using sports vocabulary such as player names, item names which makes AWS Translate cannot identify and translate correctly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nova funcionalidade: Agora é possível recuperar os nomes dos parâmetros de métodos e construtores usando reflection.
Como fazer:
Use o método getConstructor(...) para obter o construtor desejado.
Em seguida, chame getParameters() para obter um array de Parameter.
Use getName() para acessar o nome de cada parâmetro.
Importante!
Por padrão, os nomes exibidos serão genéricos (arg0, arg1).
Para ver os nomes reais, é necessário compilar o código com a flag:




-parameters


Exemplo com flag:
javac -parameters Usuario.java


Sem essa flag:
Antes do Java 8:
Dependia de bibliotecas externas, como o Paranamer:
Paranamer paranamer = new CachingParanamer();
String[] parameterNames = paranamer.lookupParameterNames(constructor);


Vantagens da nova abordagem:
Evita dependências externas.
Facilita o uso de reflection de forma mais limpa e segura.
🛠️ Como compilar com a flag -parameters:
javac -parameters Usuario.java ReflectionTeste.java


E depois execute:
java ReflectionTeste


🧾 Saída esperada (com -parameters):
true: nome
true: pontos


🔁 Saída sem a flag -parameters:
false: arg0
false: arg1


💡 Importante: Para que os nomes reais dos parâmetros apareçam (nome, pontos), compile com a flag -parameters.

With Crew AI, teams are spinning up agents that:
Launch predictive marketing campaigns
Automate financial back-office ops
Optimize inventory and logistics
And tackle 100+ other enterprise use cases
But here’s the catch: agents are only as good as the data they can reach. That’s where SWIRL comes in.

By pairing Crew AI with SWIRL, you get more than just agents—you get enterprise-ready, data-rich workflows that scale. No custom plumbing. No brittle integrations.
With Crew AI + SWIRL, your agents can:
Connect to 100+ enterprise data sources out-of-the-box
Fetch the most relevant structured/unstructured data across silos
Respect row-level permissions with real enterprise auth
Summarize and answer with your LLM of choice
Plug in easily via zero-code connectors
Want to see this in action?

With the growth of microservices and serverless architectures, it's more important than ever to implement robust authentication mechanisms. Here’s a comprehensive guide on managing authentication in a GraphQL API in 2025.
GraphQL, a query language for APIs, allows clients to request only the data they need. This flexibility makes it popular in modern web applications. However, it also introduces unique challenges in securing endpoints and managing user access.

I spent the week running through various LocalStack Pro sample apps to make sure everything worked as expected. What I didn’t expect was to get hands-on with a whole bunch of AWS services I’ve barely touched before (and a few I had honestly never even heard of).
SageMaker → Machine learning workflows


RDS → Managed relational databases


Neptune → Graph databases


Step Functions → Orchestration workflows


Glue → Data catalog and ETL


MQ → Managed message brokers


Route 53 → DNS and traffic routing



...plus the usual mix of storage, compute, and API Gateway goodness.
What stood out this week was how much you can learn just by doing. I didn’t plan to dive into graph databases or message brokers, but while debugging and tinkering, I picked up quite a bit.
Having everything local with LocalStack definitely made that exploration easier and less intimidating.
First things first: I need to finish my Meme App (priorities are priorities).
Once that’s wrapped, I’d like to turn some of this accidental learning into small demos and share tips on how to explore unfamiliar AWS services without the usual stress.
If you’ve ever gone down the AWS rabbit hole and come out the other side with new scars and skills, I’d love to hear your story too. Just hit me up on Twitter or LinkedIn. Catch y'all next week!]]></summary>

Without a clear way to authenticate dynamically, AI agents either hit brittle, hardcoded APIs or introduce serious security gaps.

When MCP was first introduced, it focused on helping AI agents interact with APIs. But it left out that one critical capability: authorization. For the past six months, the MCP team has been working to change that, building a secure, dynamic authorization layer that can keep up with the unpredictable nature of agentic systems.

Often, when I'm on discovery calls with potential clients, a common question arises: "Do you think building an app for my business is a good idea?" My response can sometimes be neutral—or even disappointing—but there's an essential reason for that honesty.
Statistically speaking, about 90% of SaaS (Software as a Service) startups fail. This fact isn't meant to discourage entrepreneurs but to inject a necessary dose of realism. As a software developer, I notice that of all the apps installed on my phone or computer, roughly 90% rarely get opened after the initial installation.

Even with Terraform and Ansible, subtle differences sneak in—especially after a few hotfixes. We had OpenSSL versions drift apart, and legacy clients couldn’t connect after a switch. Version control your infra and regularly diff live configs.

That kind of diversity hasn’t gone away—it’s just shifted. Today:
There are 35+ active CPU architecture families: x86/64, Arm, MIPS, RISC-V, Xtensa, TriCore, SPARC, PIC, AVR, and many more

Some use unusual instruction widths (e.g., 13-bit for Padauk’s $0.03 MCU)

Not all CPUs support floating-point—or even 8-bit operations



And beyond the hardware:

Let's be honest: AI is everywhere these days. From the apps on our phones to the tools we use at work, artificial intelligence is quietly (and sometimes not-so-quietly) reshaping how we get things done. But for many of us, the real magic happens when AI becomes a true partner, helping us brainstorm, automate the boring stuff, and even spark a little creativity when we need it most.
If you've ever wished you could have a super-smart assistant right in your terminal, or wondered how to use AI in ways that are actually practical (and not just hype), you're in the right place.

Thanks to open-source tools, free resources, and a bit of creativity, it’s entirely possible to build a secure, functional crypto token or coin on a budget of exactly $0.
In this article, I’ll walk you through how to do just that—without sacrificing quality, security, or credibility.
If you're building a cryptocurrency on a budget, the Ethereum blockchain is a great starting point. More specifically, the ERC-20 token standard lets you launch a new token by simply writing and deploying a smart contract.
You don’t need to build your own blockchain, manage nodes, or run any servers. Instead, you leverage the security and reliability of Ethereum’s existing infrastructure.

LinkedIn 
This article will only cover VS code extensions that helped me during development. Some of these tools were introduced to me by a friend of mine. You can search for them in the VS extension marketplace 👍
It integrates Draw.io into your VScode. Making creating diagrams a lot easier. This tool is useful for creating a mockup design for the frontend of the web application. 
This is probably one of my favorite Git VScode extensions. A really great tool for visualizing your Git repository commits. I use it to track the commits I made. If you are working with another developer, you can see the commits made by each other in different color trees.
This is a tool that has helped me categorise my projects. I have made a lot of projects and they tend to be scattered. This tool helped me organise them into blocks. Clicking on them takes me to the project workspace immediately.
One of my favorite tools in my VScode workspace. This extension allows you to store you previous terminal session. You can create a configuration, these configuration can store a set of terminal commands. This is great for variety of functions, like Dockerization, Database migration, and API testings.
This is probably my favorite tool out of all the extensions. It prevents the need to add a console.log in my JS files. I can see the output clearly in the console. It boosts my productivity a lot , and I recommend it the most.
I hope this article helped with your workspace productivity. 
Happy coding ! 😄]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Na parte 1 desta série, vimos como o Module Federation permite compartilhar componentes entre diferentes aplicações sem precisar instalar pacotes ou duplicar código. Agora, vamos dar um passo além: como enviar dados de uma aplicação para outra.
Imagine que você tem dois apps:
🔵 MF Consumer  — quem consome um componente remoto
🟢 MF Provider  — quem disponibiliza esse componente
conforme a imagem abaixo:

Vamos supor que o MF Provider tenha um componente chamado App que precisa exibir os dados de um usuário ( nome e email ). Esses dados vêm diretamente do MF Consumer.
No MF Consumer, tem o seguinte:

MF Consumer
Aqui, criei um objeto user e passei como props para o componente Provider , que está vindo do MF Provider.
No lado do MF Provider , defini o tipo das props ( ProviderProps ) e usei os dados recebidos normalmente, como faríamos em qualquer componente React, como segue:

MF Provider
Não é magia. É só React com Module Federation! Ao consumir um componente remoto, você ainda pode passar props normalmente, como se ele fosse local. Isso funciona porque, por baixo dos panos, o Webpack cuida de toda a importação remota — mas o React continua funcionando do jeito que a gente conhece.
Com isso, conseguimos:
Importar um componente remoto com Module Federation
Passar dados para esse componente via props
Exibir esses dados no MF Provider como se tudo estivesse rodando no mesmo app
Acompanhe AQUI como ficou o resultado final.
No próximo artigo, vou mostrar como esse padrão pode ser estendido para eventos e callbacks entre MF Consumer e MF Provider (ex: o usuário clica em algo no Provider e o Consumer reage).
💬 Curtiu? Me conta nos comentários como você está usando MF ou se está considerando aplicar na sua stack.

It's perfect for anything from WordPress to the most complex Symfony app. However, out of the box it's not tailored to be used alongside Node. Granted, it does come bundled with Node pre-installed, but if you want to use your PHP backend with a TypeScript frontend, it requires a tiny bit of configuration. This is what this article is about. It is inspired by Andy Blum's blog post over at Lullabot. My approach is similar but a bit simpler.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No meu artigo anterior, mostrei como montei um projeto com Micro Frontends usando Rsbuild, Module Federation, pnpm e Lerna , tudo rodando num monorepo. Agora, quero dar um passo além e explicar o “porquê” dessa escolha.
É uma forma de compartilhar código entre diferentes aplicações em tempo de execução. Funciona como se um app pudesse importar um componente diretamente do outro — sem instalar, copiar ou duplicar código.
Exemplo real no meu repositório:
📦 mf_provider(chamo de componente filho): expõe um componente Button
📦 mf_consumer_(_chamo de componente pai): consome esse mesmo Header, remotamente, sem precisar tê-lo no código local
✅ Evita reescrever os mesmos componentes em diferentes apps (pelo menos tenta)
✅ Permite deploys independentes (independência de times)
✅ Melhora a escalabilidade de grandes projetos
✅ Facilita refatorações e testes A/B isolados
✅ Acelera o desenvolvimento com reuso real de UI e lógica
“Você não precisa de Micro Frontends… até precisar.”
Nem todo projeto precisa disso.
🔸 Se o projeto é pequeno e centralizado, pode ser complexidade desnecessária
🔸 Se as equipes compartilham tudo e fazem deploy juntos, MF talvez seja overkill
🔸 Se o bundle não é um problema, pode usar libs compartilhadas internas
🚀 Quer ver isso funcionando de verdade? O repositório tá aqui:

According to Artem Shaginyan, founder and head of strategy of Web3 payment company Lunu Pay, the Cannes municipal government is aiming for a 90% adoption rate among local merchants. The executive also told Cointelegraph:
"This is a big signal. When a city like Cannes, known globally for culture and commerce, starts integrating crypto at scale, it shows that Web3 payments aren’t just a niche thing anymore. It’s about proving that crypto can work in everyday settings, not just online or in theory."

Here's a deep dive into what it is, why you'd use it, and a step-by-step guide to implementing it in Express.
1.Separation of Concerns
Versioning in headers keeps your URL space clean - clients still call /users instead of /v1/users or /v2/users.
2.Content Negotiation
HTTP was designed around content negotiation. You can leverage the Accept header or a custom header (e.g. X-API-Version) to tell your server which variant of the response to emit.
3.Granular Control
You can version on a per-resource or even per-field basis depending on header values.

Nos últimos dias, mergulhei em um experimento que pode facilitar (e muito!) a vida de quem trabalha com micro frontends no dia a dia.
🎯 Criei um repositório open source usando:
Rsbuild (alternativa moderna e rápida ao Webpack)
Module Federation para isolar e compartilhar componentes entre apps
pnpm + Lerna pra orquestrar tudo de forma leve e organizada
📂 Estrutura simples, mas poderosa:
apps/mf_provider: expõe componentes
apps/mf_consumer: consome via Module Federation
Tudo rodando em paralelo com pnpm dev
🔗 Confere lá e, se curtir, arrocha um like ou manda feedback!
Repositório no Github
O pnpm tem um recurso bem legal chamado Catalogs. Ele serve para definir versões de dependências como constantes, que podem ser reutilizadas nos módulos internos dentro do package.json de cada projeto.
Exemplo:
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
# Define a catalog of version ranges.
catalog:
  react: "^18.3.1"
  react-dom: "^18.3.1"

# Nos módulos internos, consigo reutilizar a versão definida no pnpm-workspace.yaml
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "catalog",
    "react-dom": "catalog"
  }

Outra curiosidade bem legal é a praticidade que o Lerna oferece na criação de um monorepo, permitindo executar vários apps juntos de forma paralela com um único comando, como no exemplo abaixo:
"dev": "lerna run --parallel dev",

Rsbuild + Module Federation se mostrou extremamente simples de estruturar e entender, especialmente se comparado ao uso do plugin com Webpack. No próximo artigo, trarei um exemplo utilizando Vite para termos uma ideia prática.
Até mais.

The introduction of the Gamepad API in the late 2010s marked a paradigm shift; it allowed developers to create immersive gaming experiences that can fully leverage console-style gamepad controls within HTML5 applications.

Analyst predicts a low VIX (

Bitcoin network economist Timothy Peterson raised Bitcoin’s (BTC) chances of hitting a new high in 100 days, and he maintains an optimistic outlook in 2025. 
In an analysis shared on X that ties BTC’s price action to the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) —an indicator that measures 30-day market volatility expectations — the analyst pointed out that the VIX index has dropped from 55 to 25 over the past 50 trading days. A VIX score below 18 implied a “risk-on” environment, favoring assets like Bitcoin. 
Peterson’s model, which had a 95% tracking accuracy, predicted a $135,000 target within the next 100 days if the VIX remains low. This aligns with Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, as a low VIX reduces uncertainty, encouraging investment in ri…]]></summary>

The fintech revolution is coming, and at its core lies one of the most underrated innovations of our time — the blockchain ledger. This isn’t just about cryptocurrencies or buzzwords. It’s about the raw cryptographic power that makes trustless, decentralized finance possible.
Welcome to Episode 1 of our new video series breaking down the XRP Ledger (XRPL) — one concept at a time.
🎥 Watch on YouTube
In this episode, we dive into the two cryptographic pillars behind the XRPL and modern blockchain systems:
Hashing: Immutable fingerprints for any data
Encryption: Protecting the integrity and privacy of transactions
Why Hashing ≠ Encryption (and why that matters)
How the XRPL uses these concepts under the hood
Whether you're new to Web3 or building on XRPL, these are tools you must understand.
Most developers know what a hash function is. Fewer understand why it's critical in blockchain consensus, how it supports immutability, or how encryption standards impact financial systems at scale.
This series will bridge that gap — starting here.
SHA-256
Public/Private Key Encryption
XRP Ledger’s core protocol
Blockchain developers
Fintech engineers
XRPL builders
Anyone curious about real-world cryptography in action






📢 Follow the series — we’ll be breaking down the XRPL layer by layer, from consensus algorithms to smart contract integration (Hooks), and more.
➡️ Drop your thoughts or questions below — and let’s build the future of finance, together.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firebase Studio was officially launched in preview on April 9, 2025, as announced on the Firebase blog. It is a cloud-based, agentic development environment designed to accelerate the building, testing, deployment, and running of production-quality AI applications—all within a unified platform.
📦 Conclusion
Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex real-time app, Firebase provides a comprehensive toolkit. The Firebase Console gives you a powerful cloud dashboard, while the Emulator Suite allows you to develop and test locally like a pro. Together, they form what many developers refer to as "Firebase Studio" — your command center for rapid, scalable, and secure app development.]]></summary>

Resource                     Free Tier
EC2 Type,                    t2.micro / t3.micro (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM)

IntelliJ on EC2: While technically possible with X11 forwarding or a remote desktop, it's not recommended on Free Tier due to performance constraints. Use IntelliJ on your local machine, and treat EC2 as the remote runtime/server.

The nodes mostly comprise human users who provide data in exchange for rewards via the network’s mobile application, COIN. “The vast majority of our 10 million nodes are mobile users, but some are IoT devices like smart speakers,” Levin told Cointelegraph. 
Approximately 80% of XYO’s users are non-crypto natives who are participating in Web3 for the first time, he added.
They include truckers, rideshare drivers, delivery people, and nurses among others, Levin said, adding that “95% convert after onboarding through the COIN app.”

Here's a step-by-step guide to get you set up:
Step 1: Set up your React Native project
If you already have a React Native project, you can skip this step.
If you're starting fresh, create a new React Native project using your preferred method (React Native CLI or Expo).
React Native CLI:
npx react-native init MyAwesomeApp
cd MyAwesomeApp

Expo:
npx create-expo-app MyAwesomeApp

We wrote docs assuming someone would read them. We wrapped our endpoints in auth flows and user interfaces. We expected a person, or maybe a service, on the other side.
But that’s already changing.
AI models are now consuming APIs directly. Not as passive data readers, but as active participants. They parse user intent, synthesize context, and trigger backend actions. They're not just clients. They're intermediaries.
And that changes everything.
When models call APIs, natural language stops being enough.
We like to imagine that models “understand” prompts, but in practice, they just compute probabilities over sequences of text. They don’t grasp nuance the way humans do. A tiny shift in phrasing can derail the whole interaction.

According to the report, 94% of employees have some familiarity with generative AI tools. Most execs estimated 4% of their teams already use AI heavily at work. However, the real figure is 12%, three times higher.

Even skeptics are on board. The report labels cautious employees as "Gloomers" (37% of the workforce), who want tight AI oversight, and "Doomers" (4%), who distrust AI outright. Yet 80% of Gloomers and 50% of Doomers say they’re comfortable using AI at work. That shows widespread readiness, not just enthusiasm from the usual suspects.

Bitcoin trends toward $100,000. Will bears sell at this level?

Altcoins are trading above their respective support levels, suggesting that an altcoin rally is brewing.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) tight consolidation resolved in favor of the bulls with a break above the $95,000 barrier on May 1. The bulls are trying to push the price to the psychologically crucial level at $100,000, which may again witness a tough battle between the bulls and the bears. 
Veteran trader Peter Brandt sounded positive when he said in a post on X that Bitcoin could rally to the $125,000 to $150,000 range by August or September 2025 if it manages to regain its broken parabolic slope. However, Brandt cautioned that the rally could be followed by a sharp correction of more than 50%.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Mongoose and TypeScript, two helper types make your life much easier:
/**
 * Extracts the “plain” shape of your schema—
 * just the fields you defined, without Mongoose’s built-in methods or `_id`.
 */
export type User = InferSchemaType<typeof userSchema>;

/**
 * Represents a fully “hydrated” Mongoose document:
 * your fields plus all of Mongoose’s methods and metadata
 * (e.g. `_id`, `save()`, `populate()`, etc.).
 */
export type UserDocument = HydratedDocument<User>;

export const userModel = model<UserDocument>("user", userSchema);

InferSchemaType


• Produces a pure TypeScript type from your schema definition.
• Use it whenever you need just the data shape (e.g. DTOs, service inputs/outputs).
HydratedDocument


• Wraps your base type T with Mongoose’s document helpers.
• Use it for any function that deals with real, database-backed 
For example, in a repository interface you might write:
export interface IUserRepository {
  findOneByEmail(email: string): Promise<UserDocument>;
  findById(id: Types.ObjectId): Promise<UserDocument>;
  create(
    createUserDto: Pick<CreateUserDto, 'email' | 'password'>,
  ): Promise<UserDocument>;
}

Here, each method clearly promises a “live” Mongoose document (with built-in methods) while elsewhere you can rely on User for pure data shapes—keeping your boundaries and types crystal clear.

In contrast to batch processing, where data is collected and processed in chunks, streaming data processing deals with data in motion. Instead of waiting for data to accumulate before running transformations, streaming pipelines ingest and process each piece of data as it arrives. This model enables organizations to respond to events in real time, a capability that’s becoming increasingly essential in domains like finance, security, and customer experience.

For many data engineering tasks, real-time insights aren’t necessary. In fact, a large portion of the data processed across organizations happens in scheduled intervals—daily sales reports, weekly data refreshes, monthly billing cycles. This is where batch processing comes in, and despite the growing popularity of streaming, batch remains the backbone of many data-driven workflows.

An ML project to empower smarter agriculture decisions
GitHub Repo →
Agriculture remains the backbone of the Indian economy, yet farmers still face unpredictable yields due to varying environmental and input conditions. To tackle this issue, I built a machine learning model that predicts crop yield based on historical and input-based features.
This project is simple, beginner-friendly, and practical.
"How can we accurately predict crop yield based on inputs like rainfall, fertilizer, and pesticide use?"
Farmers often rely on experience or guesswork. This model helps bring data-driven decision-making to the field.
The dataset includes:
Area
Production
Crop Year
Rainfall
Fertilizer
Pesticide
📌 Categorical features are label-encoded for model compatibility.
Python 🐍
Pandas & NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (optional for plots)
I trained and evaluated three regression models:
Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor ✅ Best performer



  
  
  Evaluation Metrics:



R² Score
Adjusted R²
RMSE
Gradient Boosting gave the highest R² score on the test set and was chosen as the final model.
The script allows users to input values for the features and get instant yield predictions.
Clone the repo and run the script locally:
git clone https://github.com/h4ck3r0/crop-yielding-prediction
cd crop-yielding-prediction
python main.py

Add UI with Streamlit or Flask
Integrate with real-time weather APIs
Visual analytics for predictions
This is a practical application of ML in solving a real-world agricultural problem.

Once data has been ingested into your system, the next step is to prepare it for actual use. This typically involves cleaning, transforming, and storing the data in a way that supports analysis, reporting, or further processing. This is where data pipelines come in, and at the center of pipeline design are two common strategies: ETL and ELT.

Before we can analyze, model, or visualize data, we first need to get it into our systems. This step—often taken for granted—is known as data ingestion. It’s the bridge between the outside world and the internal data infrastructure, and it plays a critical role in how data is shaped from day one.
In this post, we’ll break down the types of data sources you’ll encounter, the ingestion strategies available, and what trade-offs to consider when designing ingestion workflows.

Using AI to Generate Seed Data for Supabase
Every developer knows the importance of having good seed data for fast testing and development. Manually crafting SQL queries to populate your database with realistic data can be tedious and error-prone, especially when dealing with complex relationships between tables.
SupaSeeder connects to your Supabase instance, extracts the database schema, then you can either generate SQL insert statements or optimized prompts to use with any AI model to generate the seed data you need.
supaseeder.vercel.app 🔥



  
  
  ⚙️ How It Works




Provide Supabase URL & Anon Key

Connects to your database and reads the schema.


Write a prompt

Describe the data you want (e.g. "10 users with 5 posts each").


Pick mode





Prompt Mode: Get optimized prompts to use with any AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
Direct Mode: Get complete SQL queries generated using OpenAI
Get SQL output
Copy & paste to your SQL editor or Supabase SQL Runner.
Clone the repository:




   git clone https://github.com/mmvergara/supaseeder.git
   cd supaseeder

Install dependencies:




   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install

Start the development server:




   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev]]></summary>

The controlnet-1.1-x-realistic-vision-v2.0 model is a powerful AI tool created by Usama Ehsan that combines several advanced techniques to generate high-quality, realistic images. It builds upon the ControlNet and Realistic Vision models, incorporating techniques like multi-ControlNet, single-ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and consistency-decoder to produce remarkably realistic and visually stunning outputs.
The controlnet-1.1-x-realistic-vision-v2.0 model takes a variety of inputs, including an image, a prompt, and various parameters to fine-tune the generation process. The output is a high-quality, realistic image that aligns with the provided prompt and input image.
Image: The input image that serves as a reference or starting point for the generation process.
Prompt: A text description that guides the model in generating the desired image.
Seed: A numerical value that can be used to randomize the generation process.
Steps: The number of inference steps to be taken during the generation process.
Strength: The strength or weight of the control signal, which determines how much the model should focus on the input image.
Max Width/Height: The maximum dimensions of the generated image.
Guidance Scale: A parameter that controls the balance between the input prompt and the control signal.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the world of software development—especially with distributed systems and microservices—asynchronous messaging has become essential for building scalable and resilient applications. Two of the most common messaging patterns are queues and topics. While they might sound similar, their behavior and use cases are quite different.
In this post, I’ll explain what they are, how they differ, and when to use each one.
A queue follows a point-to-point communication model: messages are sent by a producer and consumed by only one consumer. Once a message is processed, it is removed from the queue.
Key characteristics:
Each message is processed by one and only one consumer.
Guarantees single delivery of each message.
Useful for load balancing between multiple consumers.

Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of the World Wide Web is dead. Instead of an open and accessible global information system, the web is controlled by centralized global data conglomerates, which don’t just restrict free speech but also monetize your data as a price of entry. Web2 firms have built walled gardens with massive information asymmetry between companies and users.
Blockchain-based decentralized tech challenges the status quo, offering an alternative to Web2’s closed-source infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Spring Boot and JPA, understanding how transactions and the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() operation interact can make or break your application's data consistency and performance. Yet, I often see even experienced developers overlook the nuances!
Many believe that committing a transaction is the only way to persist changes to the database. However, the 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() method forces the persistence context to synchronize with the underlying database immediately-without ending the transaction. This can be a game-changer for scenarios where you need to validate constraints or trigger database actions before the transaction completes.
But here’s the catch: improper use of 𝗳𝗹𝘂𝘀𝗵() can lead to unexpected behaviors, performance overhead, or even data inconsistencies if not handled carefully. It's crucial to know when and why to use it, especially in complex microservices or batch processing environments.
How do you approach transaction management and flushing in your Spring Boot projects? Have you ever faced a tricky bug or performance issue related to this? Share your experience or tips in the comments-let’s learn from each other!

Dependency Injection (DI) is one of the most debated design patterns in software development. While opinions vary on whether it’s universally beneficial, one thing is certain: DI can be extremely useful if not treated as a "golden hammer." Overusing it, such as blindly injecting every dependency, can lead to unnecessary complexity rather than cleaner code.
In this article, we’ll explore how DI can be effectively applied in Next.js, striking the right balance between maintainability and simplicity.

We ran a performancebenchmark to find out: comparing PostgreSQL (using pgvector + pgvectorscale) with Qdrant on 50 million embeddings.
Sub-100ms query latencies
471 queries per second (QPS) on Postgres—11x higher throughput than Qdrant (41 QPS)
Head to the full write-up for a deep dive into our vector database comparison.

At 99% recall, Postgres delivers sub-100ms query latencies and handles 11x more query throughput than Qdrant (471 QPS vs. Qdrant’s 41 QPS).
The results show that thanks to pgvectorscale, Postgres can keep up with specialized vector databases and deliver as good, if not better performance at scale. Learn more about why Postgres wins for AI and vector workloads.
How? We built pgvectorscale to push Postgres to its limits for vector workloads—without compromising recall, latency, or cost-efficiency. It turns your favorite relational database into a high-performance vector search engine.
✅ No extra systems.
✅ No new query languages.
✅ Just Postgres.
We used RTABench to run a transparent, reproducible evaluation—designed for real-world, high-scale workloads.
Curious about the architecture behind it all?
👉 Read our whitepaper on building Timescale for real-time and AI workloads
It dives into how we engineered Timescale to handle time-series, vector, and relational data—all in one Postgres-native platform.
Have you used Postgres or Qdrant for vector search?

DevOps, as the name suggests, combines Development and Operations into a unified approach. A DevOps Engineer orchestrates the entire journey of an application: planning, coding, building, testing, releasing, deploying, and monitoring. This comprehensive process ensures applications work seamlessly for end-users and integrate properly with other services.
I see DevOps Engineers as master planners who understand the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Success in this role requires both technical expertise and strong communication skills. Communication becomes crucial especially when coordinating across different teams – from developers to stakeholders.
Planning begins with constructive thinking about the development and production environments where code will b…]]></summary>

So this post was inspired by that conversation, and I hope it helps anyone else who is looking to try it out.  In a previous post I introduced how Amazon Q CLI now supports Model Context Protocol (MCP) (check out Configuring Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Amazon Q CLI for more details). 
This post will build on that and show you how to run MCP Servers via container images. As I switched to using Finch from Docker back in 2024, I will be using that - this means if you are using something different to Docker, like Podman for example, you should be able to follow along and use that tool too.

After lending $1.5 billion in loans both in Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) over the past 15 months, Two Prime decided to ditch ETH to focus solely on BTC asset management and lending, the firm announced on May 1.
“ETH’s statistical trading behavior, value proposition, and community culture have failed beyond a point that is worth engaging,” Two Primes stated.
The firm’s shift to a Bitcoin-only approach comes as ETH has lost 45% of its value year-to-date, with some optimists speculating that ETH is potentially close to the bottom and reversing its negative trend soon.

Despite this, many developers treat HTTP as a black box: something that “just works” behind the scenes. While abstraction is useful, serious web developers must move beyond it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The world of online dating has changed dramatically in the past few years — and artificial intelligence (AI) is playing a major role in that transformation. One emerging trend is AI dating pictures: profile photos generated or enhanced by AI to help users present their “best selves” on dating apps like Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, or even social media platforms.
But what exactly are AI dating pictures, and are they a good idea? Let’s break it down.
AI dating pictures refer to profile photos that are either:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When I started working with Dynamics CRM, ages ago, there were 2 topics that were the nightmare of all CRM devs:
Multi currency, aka exchange rate management
Time-zone management
Ages have passed, but those topics keep staying in the top 5 chart of my headaches-giver topics.
Just today, scrolling in my LinkedIn wall, I've found an interesting article from Nick Doelman that pointed to another article from 2021 where he solved the long-standing issue of updating exchange rates in the platform in an way that is
straightforward
elegant
deterministic
fast to set-up
and, above all, free!
It's just a matter of leveraging the right tools, that in this case are:
https://exchangeratesapi.io/: a website that provides daily updated exchange rates with a compelling licensing model that allows up to 100 api calls per month for free!
a simple Power Automate flow.
Take a look at his article for details!
🙏🏻 Thanks Nick!

I had just graduated from university, full of fire and ambition. My degree wasn’t in tech, but I was drawn to the world of possibilities I saw in it. 
This was in the early 20-teens, and the buzzword floating everywhere was “Fullstack Developer.” YouTube was overflowing with success stories, “I went from zero to six figures in a year,” “How I became a Fullstack developer without a CS degree.” It was intoxicating.

According to a May 2 Financial Times report, the ban on borrowing to fund crypto purchases is one of the upcoming crypto rules by the FCA. David Geale, FCA executive director of payments and digital finance, told the FT that “crypto is an area of potential growth for the UK, but it has to be done right.” He added:
“To do that we have to provide an appropriate level of protection.”
Geale denied claims that the FCA is hostile to the crypto industry. Instead, he explained that he views the industry as offering high-risk investments with less consumer protection. “We are open for business,“ he said.

This results in high precision and low overhead, which is essential for cloud-native environments.

You might be laughing a bit here. Of course .json and js goes hand in hand. Since the beginning of time we have used .json files to throw in config, mock data or see how many levels of data-indentation we can reach before we go crazy.
Well, what I want to do is have a data.json file where I "mock" all the data I want/need for a page so:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[🧵 Interfaces in Java, explained like you're 5!



  
  
  1️⃣ Imagine a Pizza Menu 🍕


You walk into a pizza place and see a menu. The menu promises what pizzas they offer—but doesn’t make them yet.

An interface in Java is like that menu: it defines what a class should do, but not how!  
The menu says:  
"All pizzas must have cheese 🧀"

"All pizzas must be bakeable 🔥"
Any chef (class) who follows this menu must fulfill these rules! In Java, we call this "implementing an interface."







  
  
  3️⃣ Multiple Menus, One Chef!


A chef can follow multiple menus (interfaces):  
Italian food menu 🍝

Fast food menu 🍔
Similarly, a Java class can implement many interfaces at once! (Unlike inheritance, where you only get one parent.)







  
  
  4️⃣ But… What If the Chef Cheats? 😱


If a chef says, "I’ll follow the pizza menu!" but doesn’t add cheese… BIG PROBLEM!

Java won’t allow this—it forces the class to implement every method in the interface, or the code won’t compile!  
What if some pizzas usually have tomato sauce, but not always?

Interfaces can now provide default methods—like a "standard recipe" that chefs can override if they want!  

java
interface Pizza {  
    default void addSauce() { System.out.println("Adding tomato sauce!"); }  
}]]></summary>

You might have heard of Schrödinger’s Cat — the thought experiment where a cat in a box is both alive and dead until you check. That's basically an Optional, right? A value that might exist... or not.
So, let's turn this idea into code:
enum 📦<Value> {
    case 😺(Value)
    case 😵

    init(_ from: Value) {
        self = .😺(from)
    }
}

Now we can do:
let x: 📦 = .😺(123)
let y: 📦 = .😵

But that's not quite as convenient as Swift's native syntax: let x: Int? = 123.
Can we make ours feel just as nice?
Swift lets types conform to ExpressibleByNilLiteral. Let’s do that:

Have you ever paused to wonder what really happens when you book a movie ticket online? What unfolds behind the scenes when you check show details or reserve your favorite seat? I’ve always been fascinated by the complexity beneath that simple click-and building SkyFox Cinema gave me the perfect opportunity to explore it firsthand.
SkyFox Cinema is a modern, full stack movie booking platform designed to help regional theaters embrace digital transformation. My goal was to empower local cinema owners with a robust, scalable system that leverages the latest in software engineering practices-while also challenging myself to solve real-world business and technical problems (this was a fictitious scenario I created for myself).

A well-designed app is intuitive, engaging, and keeps users coming back. On the other hand, a poorly designed app frustrates users, leading to uninstalls and negative reviews. With millions of apps competing for attention, a flawless UI/UX design can be the game-changer that sets your app apart.
Users appreciate an app that is easy to navigate. A cluttered and confusing interface overwhelms users, leading to higher bounce rates. Simplicity doesn’t mean your app should be bare-bones, but rather that it should be free from unnecessary elements that distract from the core functionality.
Minimize distractions by using a clean and structured layout. Every element should have a clear purpose.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We need ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) to enable communication between devices on a local network. Specifically, ARP is used to map an IP address (logical address) to a MAC address (physical address), which is necessary for data transmission at the data link layer.
ARP is a Layer 2 protocol used in IPv4 networks to map a known IP address to its corresponding MAC (Media Access Control) address. While IP addresses help devices find each other logically, MAC addresses are what Ethernet networks use to actually deliver packets. ARP acts as the translator between these two.
IP works at Layer 3 (Network Layer) but to actually send data over Ethernet (Layer 2), the system needs the MAC address of the destination device.

O Facade é um padrão de projeto do tipo estrutural. Ele consiste na criação de uma classe intermediária (ou fachada) que expõe uma interface simplificada para um conjunto de classes ou processos mais complexos.
Seu principal objetivo é desacoplar a lógica de negócios da complexidade de múltiplas instâncias e chamadas internas, permitindo que outras partes do sistema interajam com uma interface unificada e mais limpa. Isso melhora a organização do código, facilita a manutenção e reduz a dependência direta de implementações internas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When working with Puppeteer for web automation and scraping, you'll often encounter situations where you need to block specific requests to improve performance or reduce bandwidth usage. In this guide, we'll explore effective techniques for intercepting and blocking unwanted network requests in Puppeteer.
Blocking unnecessary requests offers several benefits:
Faster page loading - Skipping images, analytics, and ads can dramatically reduce load times
Reduced bandwidth usage - Especially important for cloud-based scraping or serverless functions
Lower memory consumption - Fewer resources to process means less memory used
Improved stability - Fewer network requests means fewer potential points of failure
Let's dive into the practical implementations.
The foundation of request blocking in Pup…]]></summary>

Originally posted : https://lexingtonthemes.com/tutorials/how-to-create-a-typography-component-with-variants-with-astro-js-and-tailwind-css/
Why do we need a typography component?
Consistent typography is key to keeping your website looking clean and organized. Without it, things can start to look messy fast. A typography component helps keep text styling uniform across your whole site. The idea here is to make it both flexible and well-defined, so you get a good balance between structure and creativity, since not everything is just black and white. ‘]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome to part 4 in the series of shell scripting. Today we will look at a script that goes through an array with complex values. Complex values such as spaces, apostrophes, and quotes.
Scripting is the process of writing a set of instructions in a programming or scripting language to automate tasks that would otherwise be done manually. In the context of shell scripting, these instructions are written for the command-line shell, allowing users to perform complex operations - like file management, backups, or software installations - with just a single script execution. It's a powerful tool for saving time and ensuring consistency in system administration and development workflows


Create the script in VIM, complex_list.sh



Write and save the script in VIM.



We can check whether it has been created  by doing ls -ltrh.



Give the permission so the script can be executed.



If we then do a ls –ltrh we can see the script has gained a green colour, meaning that it is now executable.



Output after executing the script by using the command ./




  
  
  Stay tuned, part 5 in the series coming tomorrow!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excelorithm, we build custom software solutions for startups, SMEs, and enterprise clients alike. And as the technical head here, I’ve seen a recurring pain point — many teams, including our own, spend way too much time setting up the basics of a SaaS product: authentication, subscriptions, dashboards, role management, notifications...
Sure, there are tons of SaaS starter kits out there, both free and premium. They promise speed — and often deliver — but usually at a hidden cost: vendor lock-in.
Many popular boilerplates rely on proprietary services, paid APIs, or tightly coupled ecosystems. That might be fine early on, but over time it limits your freedom, raises your costs, and ties you to someone else’s roadmap.
That’s why we built SaaSLaunchpad — a free, open-source Next.js SaaS starter kit with zero paid tool dependencies and no vendor lock-in.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why are refunds important in stablecoin payments?            
            
                
Anyone who has used traditional payment systems will likely be familiar with refunds and chargebacks. If a purchase goes wrong, like receiving damaged items or not receiving the product at all, the payer can file a complaint with the seller to recover their funds. This process of refunds builds trust between payers and sellers, ensuring secure transactions for both sides.
However, stablecoin transactions differ significantly. Unlike credit cards or PayPal, stablecoin payments are generally irreversible. Once sent, the payment is final, with no standard way to dispute or reverse it if issues arise, which can make payers wary of using stablecoins for daily purchases.

Bitcoin long-term holders are about to hit a level of unrealized profit, which has traditionally caused them to sell.

That level coincides with the return to a six-figure BTC price.

Order book data suggests that bulls may not succeed in keeping the upside going.

Bitcoin (BTC) risks a “notable increase” in selling from its older investors if price rises further, warns onchain analytics firm Glassnode.
In the latest edition of its regular newsletter, “The Week Onchain,” researchers calculated that long-term holders (LTHs) are sitting on almost 350% unrealized profits.

Fair source software is a licensing model designed to balance the freedom of open source with the revenue potential of proprietary software. This blog post explores the history, core concepts, practical applications, challenges, and future innovations of fair source software. By blending aspects of open access with commercial monetization, fair source software offers an alternative ecosystem where developers can engage communities while earning sustainable revenue. We also compare fair source with traditional licensing models using tables and bullet lists for clarity. Furthermore, we discuss additional facets such as funding strategies and legal complexities that shape this emerging model in the digital landscape.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[INTRODUCTION:
But exactly is the purpose of the Node Operators in the Catalysis Ecosystem? well let's get into that now.
They power the services (AVSs) by doing important technical tasks.
They also help protect the network by locking up funds (called 
staking)—this keeps them honest.
If they do something wrong, they can lose money so they have a 
strong reason to act fairly.
I'm pretty sure at this point you can fairly understand why they are called the backbone of the network. Basically without them nothing would work.
HOW DOES CATALYSIS WORK IN RELATION TO THE NODE OPERATORS?
Normally, running these services on many platforms is complicated and 
expensive.
Catalysis simplifies this by giving them one tool (Catalyst-CLI) 
to manage everything in one place.

Any service that's meant to live more than couple of weeks eventually reaches the stage where you feel the need to properly monitor it. You usually start with simple console.log logging, but soon realize it's not readable enough, it's not searchable enough and it's only available on your server. Probably inside Docker container.
I was exactly at that point, annoyed by constant need to ssh into my server to check one log line. I've wanted to play with Grafana ecosystem for a while, too. So it seemed to be the perfect moment.
In this post, I’ll walk you through a simple and minimal setup that streams my Node.js application's logs into the Grafana Cloud dashboard using Grafana Alloy and Loki.

When the lines blur between man and machine, you’re looking at artificial general intelligence (AGI). Unlike its counterpart, artificial narrow intelligence (ANI), which is the use of AI for solving individual problem statements, AGI represents artificial intelligence that can understand, learn and apply knowledge in a way that is indistinguishable from human cognition.
AGI is still theoretical, but the prospect of artificial intelligence being able to holistically replace human input and judgment has naturally attracted plenty of interest, with researchers, technologists and academics alike seeking to bring the concept of AGI to reality. 
Yet another strand of prevailing research seeks to explore the feasibility and implications of AG…]]></summary>

Two weeks ago, discussions around Bitcoin (BTC) and layer-1 protocols peaked during the market volatility brought on by the Trump administration’s sweeping tariffs. However, that’s since shifted to high market cap memecoins, Santiment marketing director Brian Quinlivan said in a May 1 blog post.

The agency didn’t give a reason for wanting to dismiss its case, but said its decision “does not necessarily reflect the Commission’s position on any other case.”
Balina told Cointelegraph in March that the SEC had informed him it would recommend the court dismiss the case and claimed the agency’s actions were based on a shift in the agency’s priorities.

The proposal, posted on May 1 to Sky’s decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) forum, would see the Sky (SKY) token take over the Maker (MKR) token as the protocol’s governance token.
If the DAO accepts, the change would be slated to take place around May 15 to May 19 and downgrading from SKY to MKR would also be disabled.
Sky co-founder Rune Christensen said in response to the proposal that it was a “huge milestone,” which he “fully supports,” and laments that allowing users to downgrade from SKY back to MKR has been a “key limiting factor preventing exchanges from adopting SKY.”

“What started as a routine hiring process for an engineering role quickly turned into an intelligence-gathering operation,” the company wrote in a May 1 blog post.
Kraken said the applicant’s red flags appeared early on in the process when they joined an interview under a name different from what they applied with and “occasionally switched between voices,” apparently being guided through the interview.
Rather than immediately rejecting the applicant, Kraken decided to advance them through its hiring process to gather information about the tactics used.

There are n dominoes in a line, and we place each domino vertically upright. In the beginning, we simultaneously push some of the dominoes either to the left or to the right.
After each second, each domino that is falling to the left pushes the adjacent domino on the left. Similarly, the dominoes falling to the right push their adjacent dominoes standing on the right.
When a vertical domino has dominoes falling on it from both sides, it stays still due to the balance of the forces.
For the purposes of this question, we will consider that a falling domino expends no additional force to a falling or already fallen domino.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By default, Spring Data JPA loads related data lazily, which can cause the N+1 problem — one query for the main data and more for each related item. @EntityGraph annotation fixes this by letting you load related data in a single query, without changing your entity mapping. It’s simple, improves performance, and avoids writing custom JOIN FETCH queries.
Let’s say you have a Post entity that references an Author.
Entities
@Entity
public class Post {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String title;

    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private Author author;
}

@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}

Repository
public interface PostRepository extends JpaRepository<Post, Long> {

    // attributePaths specifies related entities to eagerly load
    @EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"author"})
    List<Post> findAll();
}

Now, if you create a simple controller to return all posts and have SQL logging enabled, you'll see the queries printed in the console.
With @EntityGraph, only one query runs to fetch both the post and its author. Without it, multiple queries are executed — one for the posts and one for each author — which is the N+1 problem.
✅ Using @EntityGraph
Only one query — fast and efficient.
select p.id, p.title, a.id, a.name
from post p
left join author a on p.author_id = a.id

🚨 Not Using @EntityGraph
N+1 queries — slow and wasteful.
select * from post;
select * from author where id = ?;
select * from author where id = ?;]]></summary>

When working with data structures like lists or NumPy arrays in Python,

the standard print or pprint, or even external tools like rich, often fail to provide a clear view of the entire structure,

especially when dealing with multi-dimensional arrays or deeply nested data, making it easy to lose track of which element corresponds to which.
Let's consider the following example as an illustration.
sample = [

According to Tether’s Q1 2025 financial report, the company’s assets include $98.5 billion in direct US Treasury bills, along with over $23 billion in additional exposure through repurchase agreements and other cash-equivalent assets.

According to the announcement, Tether holds $5.6 billion in excess of reserves for its USDt (USDT) stablecoin, down from $7.1 billion in excess from the last quarter of 2024. The stablecoin has a market capitalization of $149 billion as of May 1.
“Circulating supply of USDT grew by approximately $7 billion in Q1, with a 46 million increase in user wallets,” it said. 
The company's excess capital continues to fund strategic investments, with more than $2 billion allocated in renewable energy, artificial intelligence, peer-to-peer communications, and data infrastructure. 
The stablecoin market is broadly dominated by tokens pegged to the US dollar, with USDT and Circle’s USDC holding a combined 87% share. According to the US Treasury’s Q1 2025 report, the market cap for dollar-backed stablecoins is poised to reach $2 trillion by 2028. 
European Union officials have recently raised concerns about the risks of overreliance on dollar-pegged stablecoins. According to the Bank of Italy, disruptions in the stablecoins market or the underlying bonds could have “repercussions for other parts of the global financial system.”

Despite weak US manufacturing data, Federal Reserve liquidity plans and strong corporate earnings keep equities and crypto afloat.

The total crypto market capitalization rose 8.5% since March.

Cryptocurrency traders have frequently zoomed in on the need for crypto to show a clear “decoupling” from the stock market, and over the past 10 days, the intraday movements of Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins have closely tracked those of the S&P 500, even as trade war developments have dominated market sentiment.

In an interview with Cointelegraph's Sam Bourgi at Token2049, Elissar said that stablecoins, real-world asset tokenization, the intersection between AI and crypto, alternative use cases such as decentralized science, and Web3 gaming were all niches the company is exploring.
Gaming is "part of our DNA," the executive said before reflecting on the current state of the Web3 gaming industry:

“I think it’s a missed opportunity,” Independent Reserve founder Adrian Przelozny told Cointelegraph. “Neither side has made crypto a headline issue because they’re wary of polarizing voters or sounding too niche.”
But the good news is that after more than a decade of inaction, both the ruling Australian Labor Party (ALP) and the opposition Liberal Party are promising to enact crypto regulations developed in consultation with the industry. 
In April, Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor promised to release draft crypto regulations within the first 100 days after taking office, while the Treasury itself h…]]></summary>

According to reporting from Inner City Press, a judge sentenced Eisenberg to 52 months in prison at a May 1 hearing in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case was filed in April 2024 after Eisenberg’s 2023 indictment on fraud for the Mango Markets exploit.
Eisenberg was initially scheduled to be sentenced in July 2024 following his guilty plea on the child porn charge.

Bitcoin could reach $150,000 by August or September of this year if BTC breaks above the parabolic slope pattern. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price jumped to new quarterly highs at $96,700 on May 1, a day after the US GDP contracted -0.3% for the first time since Q2 2022. Amid heightened economic concerns, the probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut rose to 62.8% for the June 18 Federal Reserve meeting. 
Over the past 24 hours, short position liquidations exceeded $137 million, with Alphractal founder Joao Wedson observing that BTC's price momentum continues to favor bullish trends.

Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, Ardoino reiterated that Tether had no plans to apply for its US dollar-pegged stablecoin USDt — the largest by market capitalization — to be compliant under MiCA in European countries, potentially forcing exchanges to delist the stablecoin. He added that though crypto firms had to follow regulations, there was a “fear of compliance” among companies in the EU.

According to the announcement, the project relies entirely on donations, does not have venture funding, and does not have any pre-mined token allocations or a governance token. The project's team wrote in a May 1 X post:
"General-purpose L2s should be commodities — simple, replaceable, and free from centralized dependencies or risky governance. Ethereum R1 is our answer to that call — the rollup grounded in credible neutrality, decentralization, and censorship resistance."

Ten years ago, the state created the United States’ first comprehensive regulatory framework for firms dealing in cryptocurrencies, including key consumer protection, anti-money laundering compliance and cybersecurity guidelines.
In September 2015, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) issued its first BitLicense to Circle Internet Financial, enabling the company to conduct digital currency business activity in the state. Ripple Markets received the second BitLicense in 2016. Circle and Ripple went on to become giant players in the global cryptocurrency and stablecoin industry.

Bitcoin pressures shorts after 3% daily gains
Data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro and TradingView showed BTC/USD reaching $96,955 on Bitstamp, its highest since Feb. 22.
Increasingly close to six figures, Bitcoin rose with US stocks at the Wall Street open as Microsoft gained 10% to become the world’s highest-valued public company.
Reacting, popular trader Daan Crypto Trades suggested that stocks may be on the cusp of a return to sustained bullish trajectory.
“Stocks trade at a key area here,” he wrote in ongoing X analysis.

The Bybit hack resulted in the largest loss of funds to cyber hackers by a cryptocurrency exchange in history. It served as a wake-up call for those complacent about the state of security threats in the digital assets space. Everyone must learn the lesson from this heist — enterprise-grade custody solutions require tech to be accompanied by transparency.
Unlike many previous incidents, this loss of funds was not due to a faulty smart contract, lost/mismanaged keys or deliberate mismanagement or rehypothecation of user funds, but rather a sophisticated social engineering attack that exploited vulnerabilities in operational security.

During a fireside chat at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on May 1, Chow said institutional interest in Bitcoin yield products has grown exponentially over the past few years.
Initially, generating Bitcoin yield was nearly impossible. However, recent innovations like staking via proof-of-stake (PoS) protocols and delta-neutral trading strategies have made this possible.
Layer-1 and layer-2 advancements, such as Babylon, have made these strategies more viable. Babylon allows BTC holders to earn yield on their assets, which are used to provide security and liquidity for PoS networks.

“There’s no standard way for wallets, apps, or protocols to interpret or display this information,” decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem development organization Wonderland wrote in a May 1 X post. Wallets, decentralized applications (DApps), block explorers and smart contracts follow different rules.
“The result? A messy, inconsistent experience that breaks cross-chain UX,“ Wonderland stated.
Wonderland is a group of developers, researchers and data scientists focused on improving the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. The organization partnered with multiple DeFi protocols, including Optimism, Aztec, Connext and Yearn.

“These things move incredibly slowly, you have to show value, you have to show adoption first,” Yin said, comparing RWA’s currently developing stages with the early days of Bitcoin (BTC) and stablecoins.
“Only now, 10 years later, are they beginning to think about using the stablecoin. The same thing is going to happen in tokenized assets or tokenization,” Yin said.

The Google subpoena scam is a type of phishing attack where fraudsters impersonate Google to create a false sense of urgency and fear. 
Typically, you will receive an email that appears to come from no-reply@google.com, claiming to inform you of a subpoena, a formal legal request. The email will often have a subject line like “Security Alert” or “Notice of Subpoena,” making it seem urgent and legitimate. These scammers prey on your natural concern about legal matters and data privacy, hoping to trigger a reaction.
Inside the email, the scammers falsely claim that Google has been served with a subpoena requiring the company to turn over your account data, such as emails, documents or search history. The email will the…]]></summary>

According to a May 1 Bloomberg report, the firm intends to list crypto assets on E*Trade in 2026.

Bitcoin holds $95,000 as Fed rate cut odds rise to 60% for June 18 and the US economy slumps.

Breaking $95,000 could push BTC’s price toward $100,000, while dropping below $93,000 may bring the $84,000 back into the picture.

Key Bitcoin levels to watch remain around the long-term holders’ cost basis. 

Bitcoin (BTC) is once again attempting to break above $95,000 on May 1 as markets price in the possibility of the US Federal Reserve cutting rates sooner than expected.

XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

Imagine you're sitting in your favorite coffee shop, casually browsing your bank account on public Wi-Fi. Everything looks normal—padlock icon, HTTPS, the familiar interface. But in the shadows, a silent observer is watching, recording, and possibly altering everything you send. This is not science fiction; it's the chilling reality of a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack.
With the explosion of remote work, IoT devices, and public connectivity, MITM attacks are more relevant than ever. For developers, IT professionals, and security teams, the danger lies in the illusion of secure communication.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.

In React, conditional rendering allows you to dynamically render different UI components based on certain conditions. You can use JavaScript logic such as if statements, the ternary operator (? :), the logical AND (&&), or assign JSX to variables.
Using if Statements


The simplest way to conditionally render components is by using if statements inside a function component.
Example:





function AlertMessage({ show }) {
  if (!show) {
    return null;
  }
  return <p className="alert">This is an alert message!</p>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <AlertMessage show={true} />;
}

In this example, if show is false, the component returns null and nothing is rendered.
Using Ternary Operator (? :)


The ternary operator is a compact way to return di…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key points:

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

Have you ever run a SQL query that just took forever and wondered, "Why is this so slow?" You're not alone. Databases are fast until they're not. And one of the simplest, yet most powerful performance tricks in SQL is indexing.
What indexing really means in MySQL 


Why indexes are performance game changers


The exact results of an experiment we ran on 80,000+ records in 


MySQL 5.7 on a local setup (8GB RAM, SSD)


When indexing helps and when it doesn't



Let's dive in.

Think of an index like a book's table of contents. If you need Chapter 8, you don't flip through every single page you jump straight to it. That's what MySQL does with an index.

Hello everyone! Welcome to the second entry in my reading journey series. This time I have managed to read only 5 books. While I’m a little bit behind on my Goodreads goal of reading 52 books in the year, the last couple of months have been very busy with the end of the academic winter term. Now that I’m done with classes, I’m sure that I can have more time for reading and hopefully catch up to my goal. Let’s go into the reviews for this entry!

I briefly mentioned in the last entry that I was starting to read a collection of Celtic fairy tales and lore that my dad gifted me for Christmas. The first book in this collection is Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland by Lady Wilde. It contains a varied recollection of folklore and fairy tales.

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

After doing my first job as a frontend engineer in a startup for an year, I left my job. Their are multiple reasons for it, but that was the story of another time.
After that I decided to not pursue the tech career and start my chocolate factory - HAKI, a chocolate spread idea that crossed my mind.


If anyone is thinking, why making a chocolate spread would be so hard, like I thought initially, my 1st two variants caught fungus within a week.

Long time, messaging a hundred people for advice and many failed attempts, now I'm here finally — with the most delicious recipe made using clean, wholesome ingredients to keep it truly healthy.
Ahh and please follow Haki on @eathaki_ to know more about it.

We're still on the lookout for a graphic designer who's excited to help build HAKI — feel free to drop me an email if someone comes to mind.
Thank you so much for reading it till here 😊

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell.

The company also set more favorable chances of approval for other altcoin ETFs, including proposed funds holding XRP (XRP) and Dogecoin (DOGE), Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in an X post. 
The estimates reflect an improved outlook from Bloomberg analysts. In a February analysis, Bloomberg pegged the odds of a Solana (SOL) ETF approval at only 70%. They ascribed a 65% and 75% chance of approval to funds holding XRP and DOGE, respectively.

In an April 30 filing in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), lawyers for Coinbase argued that a First Circuit Court of Appeals decision set a “dangerous precedent” for crypto users, potentially allowing the government to “trace users’ every crypto transaction in the past and monitor every crypto transaction in the future.” The appeal to the Supreme Court stemmed from petitioner James Harper, a Coinbase user, who took legal action against the IRS after the crypto exchange was forced to turn over transaction data to the government using a sweeping “John Doe…]]></summary>

Stablecoins’ cumulative market cap currently stands at roughly $230 billion, but “[e]volving market dynamics [have] the potential to accelerate stablecoins’ trajectory to reach ~$2tn in market cap by 2028,” the Treasury said in the April 30 report. 
A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to a traditional asset like the US dollar. According to the report, such tokens are already “ubiquitously utilized as ‘cash on-chain,’ effectively serving as a new payment mechanism.”

Bitcoin’s price increased by sixfold each time its age increased by 40%.

If the pattern holds, Bitcoin could rally to $351,046 in 2025.

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.
Despite the dismal price action, dismissing Ethereum as a relic may be premature. The network continues to evolve, and th…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Blockchain payments firm Ripple has reportedly bid up to $5 billion in an effort to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle, but the offer was rejected.
According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally.

In an exclusive interview, Markova described the competition with dollar-pegged stablecoins as “all about sovereignty.” She compared the situation to earlier tensions between governments and US payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamic with stablecoins — on a smaller scale for now — but they’re definitely emerging as a new arena for sovereign concerns,” she said.

US GDP shrank -0.3% in Q1, far below +0.3% forecasts, sparking recession fears.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023. Polymarket odds of a recession in 2025 hit 67%, with consumer confidence at its lowest since May 2020.

Speaking at the Token2049 conference in Dubai on April 30, Zhao said that areas of the United Arab Emirates were “extremely pro-business,” leading to crypto adoption in Dubai, while others like Bhutan were building national Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) stockpiles. According to Zhao, the US was pressing other countries’ hands by exploring its own policies for a crypto reserve, but those in Europe didn’t seem to be reacting.
“I don’t see Europe in this discussion,” said Zhao, highlighting one exception. “Montenegro is actually quite pro-crypto. We had an active dialogue with [the] prime minister there, and he’s a very forward-thin…]]></summary>

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…]]></summary>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it. 
This is not the first time products have been revealed to be inauthentic, with the Honey Authenticity Network highlighting that one-third of all honey products were fak…]]></summary>

On April 2, Trump levied “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on 185 countries and territories. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,200 points on April 4, while the S&P 500 dropped nearly 6%, its largest decline since March 2020. Bitcoin (BTC) went along for the ride but broke from stocks as it recovered toward the end of the month.

In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy.
The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Modern .NET applications often rely on external services for data, messaging, and more.
Here are a few problems you can suffer when calling external APIs:
Transient failures: An external service might be slow or unreachable for a brief moment.
Partial outages: Another system could be in maintenance mode, limiting your access.
Network instability: Users with slow internet connections might experience short outages or timeouts.
Overloaded service: Another service could be overloaded with requests, leading to slow responses.
Networks are unstable, and you will suffer such problems sooner or later.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a modern approach to provisioning cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or OpenTofu. These technologies improve scalability, repeatability, and automation—but they can also introduce security risks if the code is misconfigured. For example, exposing an S3 bucket to the public or disabling encryption can lead to serious data breaches.
This article introduces CoGuard, a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool designed specifically to analyze configuration files used in infrastructure code. We’ll demonstrate how to scan Terraform code, interpret results, and automate the scanning process in a CI/CD workflow.

Firefox is a powerful, free, and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. The journey of Firefox began in **2002, when it was initially launched under the name *“Phoenix”. Due to trademark conflicts, it was later renamed *“Firebird”, and finally, in **2004, it became known as *“Firefox”*.
The main objective was to offer a lightweight, secure, and flexible browser alternative to the then-dominant Internet Explorer. Firefox quickly became popular due to its faster performance, tabbed browsing, and support for third-party **extensions (add-ons).
Over time, Firefox introduced several innovations such as:
Private Browsing Mode

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, 2025 has ushered in a paradigm shift known as vibe coding. Coined by AI researchers, vibe coding represents a transition from traditional, syntax-heavy programming to a more intuitive, AI-assisted approach where developers articulate their intentions in natural language, and AI tools generate the corresponding code.
At its core, vibe coding is about conveying the desired functionality or behavior of software through conversational prompts. Instead of meticulously writing out code line by line, developers describe what they want the software to do, and AI models translate these descriptions into executable code.

Will AI Take My Job?
Anita Olsen ・ Apr 22
#discuss
        #ai
      
Sure, we code daily and AI shines at spitting out code. But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.
Apart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:
Inter-team planning
Brainstorming sessions
Putting late sprints back on track
Designing requirements and user stories
Decomposing a full project into milestones
Scoping tasks with Product people
Reviewing architecture designs
Negotiating deadlines
Talking to clients
And that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn't surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can't replace that human interaction yet.
But sure, our job as coders will change. Even if we're skeptical about AI, we can't ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us. We have to adapt.
We won't be code monkeys anymore, cracking lines of code in exchange for bananas. AI will handle that. And if AI will change everything, let it at least kill dumb SCRUM ceremonies.

There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals.

In an April 29 X post, tech commentator Jacob Canfield shared a scam letter sent to his home via post that appeared to be from Ledger claiming he needed to immediately perform a “critical security update” on his device. 
The letter, which uses Ledger’s logo, business address, and a reference number to feign legitimacy, asks to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s private recovery phrase under the guise of validating the device.
The letter threatens that “failure to complete this mandatory validation process may result in restricted access to your wallet and funds.”

Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.

If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.

Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening.

The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours.

Fidelity Digital Assets says Bitcoin is undervalued and the firm holds an optimistic mid-term outlook.

The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. 

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” 
As proof,  the firm cited the ‘Bitcoin Yardstick’ metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network. 
In Q1 2025, the metric stayed between -1 and 3 standard deviations, cooling from its Q4 2024 overheated levels. The number of days above 2-standard deviations dropped from 22 to 15, …]]></summary>

"The strong growth of Bitcoin and of other crypto-assets with high price volatility means risks not only for investors but also potentially for financial stability, given the growing interconnections between the digital asset ecosystem, the traditional financial sector and the real economy,” the report notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A court in India has ordered the encrypted email service Proton Mail blocked in the country for refusing to share information with authorities.
In an April 29 hearing of the High Court of Karnataka, Justice M Nagaprasanna ordered the government to “block forthwith” domain names associated with Proton Mail, citing authority under the country’s Information Technology Act of 2008. The order stemmed from a complaint filed in January by a New Delhi-based design firm, alleging that some of its employees received offensive emails through the service.  
It’s unclear whether the ban will take effect or face other possible challenges in court. The Proton team reported in March 2024 that Indian authorities had similarly proposed ordering the service blocked in response to alleged “hoax bomb threats,”…]]></summary>

The US regulator has delayed its deadline for ruling on the proposed ETF listings until June, according to two filings reviewed by Cointelegraph. 
The filings were responses to March requests from US exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX Exchange to list Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and Franklin Templeton’s XRP (XRP) ETF, respectively. 
They came on the same day that Nasdaq, another US exchange, asked for permission to list a 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. 
Dogecoin is the world’s most heavily traded memecoin, with a market capitalization of around $26 billion as of April 29, according to data from CoinGecko. X…]]></summary>

Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals.

In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.

Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors’ inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways: 

Fidelity Digital Assets’ report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum's layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.
The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin’s favor.

The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF, shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Polkadot (DOT). 
Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund. The request amounts to a regulatory review process that could determine whether Dogecoin becomes accessible to a broader range of investors through an ETF structure.

In an April 29 notice, the UK government announced draft rules for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), that would bring “crypto exchanges, dealers and agents” in line with regulations, as many residents were “exposed to risky firms and scams.” It cited discussions with US government officials, including a proposed US-UK cross-border sandbox from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Hester Peirce.

AI has been a dominant narrative since 2024, but users and companies still cannot completely trust it. Whether it’s finances, personal data or healthcare decisions, hesitation around AI’s reliability and integrity remains high.
This growing AI trust deficit is now one of the most significant barriers to widespread adoption. Decentralized, privacy-preserving technologies are quickly being recognized as viable solutions that offer verifiability, transparency and stronger data protection without compromising AI’s growth.

Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders (STHs) are back in the game as a “speculative capital” enters the market.
In an X thread on April 29, onchain analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency compliance firm Bitrace found that $649 billion worth of stablecoins flowed through addresses classified as high-risk in 2024, according to an April 29 report.
Bitrace defines high-risk blockchain addresses as those used by illegal entities to receive, transfer or store stablecoins.
Crypto compliance firms typically score crypto wallet addresses based on their likelihood of involvement in illicit activities. The higher the risk, the higher the likelihood of foul play, and the less likely compliant crypto businesses are to accept the assets.
Per the report, the amount accounted for roughly 5.14% of all stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. This is down 0.8% from 5.94% the previous year, but significantly higher than the 2.8% reported in 2022 and 1.63% in 2021.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.
