XRP ETF approval odds rise to 85% following a SEC leadership change.

Analysts predict XRP could rise to new all-time highs again in 2025.

XRP price dropped by 5% over the past 24 hours as US GDP data showed a shrinking economy. 
However, a strengthening market structure and investors’ growing hope for a spot XRP ETF approval in the United States suggest that the altcoin might revisit its April peak at $2.36 in the short term.

Imagine you're sitting in your favorite coffee shop, casually browsing your bank account on public Wi-Fi. Everything looks normal—padlock icon, HTTPS, the familiar interface. But in the shadows, a silent observer is watching, recording, and possibly altering everything you send. This is not science fiction; it's the chilling reality of a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack.
With the explosion of remote work, IoT devices, and public connectivity, MITM attacks are more relevant than ever. For developers, IT professionals, and security teams, the danger lies in the illusion of secure communication. The article you're about to read dives deep into how these attacks operate, the real-world damage they cause, and how to guard against them.

Robinhood’s Q1 results shared on April 30 show revenues fell 8.6% from the previous quarter to $927 million, topping Zacks analyst estimates by 3.16%.
The company’s crypto revenue plummeted nearly 30% quarter-on-quarter to $252 million from the firm’s record-setting Q4 2024.  
The drop could be partly attributed to the Trump administration’s tariffs, which triggered an 18% fall in the crypto market cap over the quarter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is Conditional Rendering?


In React, conditional rendering allows you to dynamically render different UI components based on certain conditions. You can use JavaScript logic such as if statements, the ternary operator (? :), the logical AND (&&), or assign JSX to variables.
Using if Statements


The simplest way to conditionally render components is by using if statements inside a function component.
Example:





function AlertMessage({ show }) {
  if (!show) {
    return null;
  }
  return <p className="alert">This is an alert message!</p>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <AlertMessage show={true} />;
}

In this example, if show is false, the component returns null and nothing is rendered.

Solana held the $140 support level for a week, a first in more than two months, highlighting traders’ growing confidence.

SOL futures open interest hit $5.75 billion on April 30, showing strong institutional interest.

With rising DEX volumes and a $9.5 billion TVL, SOL could rally to $200 before a potential spot ETF approval on Oct. 10.

Solana’s native token, SOL (SOL), fell 4% between April 29 and April 30 after failing to sustain the $150 level. Despite this short-term decline, traders seem more confident as the $140 support remained intact for a whole week, an outcome that hadn’t happened in over two months. 
As demand for leveraged SOL positions reached near record highs on April 30, traders are now reconsidering the chances of a SOL rally above $200.

Hello everyone! Welcome to the second entry in my reading journey series. This time I have managed to read only 5 books. While I’m a little bit behind on my Goodreads goal of reading 52 books in the year, the last couple of months have been very busy with the end of the academic winter term. Now that I’m done with classes, I’m sure that I can have more time for reading and hopefully catch up to my goal. Let’s go into the reviews for this entry!

I briefly mentioned in the last entry that I was starting to read a collection of Celtic fairy tales and lore that my dad gifted me for Christmas. The first book in this collection is Ancient Legends, Mystic Charms, and Superstitions of Ireland by Lady Wilde. It contains a varied recollection of folklore and fairy tales.

Traders remain cautious about ETH’s price action, but optimistic sentiment is beginning to return.

The May 7, Ethereum Pectra upgrade could boost investor sentiment, but ETH’s price action shows investors are still hesitant to open new positions.

Ether (ETH) has been trading below $1,900 since March, leading investors to question whether the failed attempt to reclaim $4,000 in December 2024 signaled the end of an era for the leading altcoin. Concerns continue to mount as derivatives market data shows that professional traders remain cautious about ETH’s price outlook. 
ETH monthly futures should trade at a premium of 5% or more compared to spot markets to compensate for the longer settlement period, but this indicator has held below the neutral threshold.

After doing my first job as a frontend engineer in a startup for an year, I left my job. Their are multiple reasons for it, but that was the story of another time.
After that I decided to not pursue the tech career and start my chocolate factory - HAKI, a chocolate spread idea that crossed my mind.


If anyone is thinking, why making a chocolate spread would be so hard, like I thought initially, my 1st two variants caught fungus within a week.

Long time, messaging a hundred people for advice and many failed attempts, now I'm here finally — with the most delicious recipe made using clean, wholesome ingredients to keep it truly healthy.
Ahh and please follow Haki on @eathaki_ to know more about it.

We're still on the lookout for a graphic designer who's excited to help build HAKI — feel free to drop me an email if someone comes to mind.

I previously served as the General Secretary of an association based in Brisbane. Throughout the year, we host around three events where professional photographers capture numerous high-quality images. Some of these photos can be as large as 18MB.
Once the events conclude, the pictures need to be uploaded to Google Albums and shared with our community. At our most recent event, the total upload size reached 5GB.
I had previously implemented an image resizer in php which I executed by running
php process.php imageprocessing <input-folder> [<output-folder> [<size>]]

The files in the input folder were processed sequentially, which worked well for a small number of images and for smaller file sizes—around 5MB. 
However, when handling a large volume of files, the process became …]]></summary>

“In the early days, only a few companies approached compliance in a serious way,” Smith told Cointelegraph at the Token2049 event. “Coinbase was our first customer — they knew from the start that they wanted to build their business that way. But for most others, it just wasn’t a major priority.”Elliptic co-founder James Smith at Token2049. Source: Cointelegraph

The former Binance executive joined a fireside panel with macroeconomic analyst Raoul Pal to discuss the rationale behind his 2022 investment in X and artificial intelligence. Zhao said:
"I think freedom of money is important, but to have freedom of money, you have to have freedom of speech. Freedom of speech is kind of the bottom line. If you don't have that, nothing — no other freedom — works."  
"So, when we invested in Twitter back then, it was based on that philosophy," Zhao continued.

Bitcoin bulls are attacking the $95,000 level again after today’s brief US GDP-induced sell-off. 

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. 

Bitcoin (BTC) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. 
The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from bus…]]></summary>

New data highlights a historical pattern that results in Bitcoin (BTC) price increasing by sixfold. Using a logarithmic chart to illustrate the trend from 2011, the model projects BTC price to hit $351,046 in 2025.
According to 21st Capital co-founder Sina, the study plots Bitcoin’s price on a log-log graph, showing a linear relationship that reflects predictable long-term growth driven by network dynamics, a behavior characteristic associated with BTC’s limited supply.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key takeaways:

ETH price has underperformed its peers during the current bull market, but gas sponsorship could lure developers and traders back to the network.

Ethereum’s upcoming Pectra upgrade promises to improve staking efficiency, potentially increasing demand for ETH.

Data suggests ETH price bottomed. Will the Pectra narrative reignite bullish momentum?

Since 2024, ETH (ETH) has been more of a meme than a market mover. Unlike most of its rivals, ETH still hasn’t reclaimed its all-time high of $4,870 from November 2021, and it regularly underperforms even in the weak altcoin market. Currently, ETH trades at $1,813, down 56% from its local peak in December 2024.
Despite the dismal price action, dismissing Ethereum as a relic may be premature. The network continues to evolve, and th…]]></summary>

According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer.
The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication.

Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility is the lowest in 563 days, signaling an impending range expansion.

Bitcoin’s breakout above $95,000 could swiftly take it to $100,000 and above.

Although the probability is low, traders should remain cautious about a pullback in the near term.

Bitcoin (BTC) has been trading in a tight consolidation near the $95,000 level for several days. K33 Research head of research Vetle Lunde said in a post on X that Bitcoin’s 7-day volatility has hit a 563-day low.
A range expansion usually follows a low-volatility period. Although it is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout, a tight consolidation just below a crucial resistance increases the likelihood of an upside rally.

In an exclusive interview, Markova described the competition with dollar-pegged stablecoins as “all about sovereignty.” She compared the situation to earlier tensions between governments and US payment giants like Visa and Mastercard. “Now we’re seeing the same dynamic with stablecoins — on a smaller scale for now — but they’re definitely emerging as a new arena for sovereign concerns,” she said.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days.

Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking.

Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023.

Bitcoin dropped to $92,910 as GDP figures were released, but sustained buy-side demand could provide support.

Bitcoin (BTC) price took an abrupt tumble as data showed the US gross domestic product (GDP) retracting by 0.3% in Q1, raising alarms among analysts anticipating a recession. Following the news, BTC price dropped to an intra-day low of $92,910, while the DOW and S&P 500 fell by 1% and 1.3% respectively. 
While the GDP figures are shocking at face value, CNBC pointed out that the drop was primarily due to “a surge in imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.” Imports are subtracted fro…]]></summary>

Brutal honesty has its place, especially when confronting discomfort, so here’s one that can’t be sweetened with honey: 96% of imported honey in the UK is fake! Tests found that 24 of 25 jars were suspicious or didn’t meet regulatory standards. 
Self-sovereign identity (SSI) can fix this. 
The UK Food Standards Agency and the European Commission both urge reform to tackle this concern by creating a robust traceability database within supply chain networks to ensure consumer transparency and trust. Data, however, is not the problem. The issue is people tampering with it. 
This is not the first time products have been revealed to be inauthentic, with the Honey Authenticity Network highlighting that one-third of all honey products were fak…]]></summary>

On April 2, Trump levied “discounted reciprocal tariffs” on 185 countries and territories. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2,200 points on April 4, while the S&P 500 dropped nearly 6%, its largest decline since March 2020. Bitcoin (BTC) went along for the ride but broke from stocks as it recovered toward the end of the month.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history.
The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X.
The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin (BTC), valued at $330.7 million.
Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero (XMR).
Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions.

But as the space matured, some disadvantages of open source surfaced. Innovative smart contract platforms and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications were forked to create direct competitors — from the wave of Uniswap clones to Ethereum forks — which prioritized speed and lower fees over decentralization.
As a result, some projects opted for closed-source development to protect proprietary designs and reduce the risk of exploits, hoping to delay or deter malicious actors by making the code harder to analyze. This approach is often criticized as “security through obsc…]]></summary>

Here are a few problems you can suffer when calling external APIs:
Transient failures: An external service might be slow or unreachable for a brief moment.
Partial outages: Another system could be in maintenance mode, limiting your access.
Network instability: Users with slow internet connections might experience short outages or timeouts.
Overloaded service: Another service could be overloaded with requests, leading to slow responses.
Networks are unstable, and you will suffer such problems sooner or later.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a modern approach to provisioning cloud infrastructure using tools like Terraform, Pulumi, or OpenTofu. These technologies improve scalability, repeatability, and automation—but they can also introduce security risks if the code is misconfigured. For example, exposing an S3 bucket to the public or disabling encryption can lead to serious data breaches.
This article introduces CoGuard, a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool designed specifically to analyze configuration files used in infrastructure code. We’ll demonstrate how to scan Terraform code, interpret results, and automate the scanning process in a CI/CD workflow.

Firefox is a powerful, free, and open-source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation. The journey of Firefox began in **2002, when it was initially launched under the name *“Phoenix”. Due to trademark conflicts, it was later renamed *“Firebird”, and finally, in **2004, it became known as *“Firefox”*.
The main objective was to offer a lightweight, secure, and flexible browser alternative to the then-dominant Internet Explorer. Firefox quickly became popular due to its faster performance, tabbed browsing, and support for third-party **extensions (add-ons).
Over time, Firefox introduced several innovations such as:
Private Browsing Mode

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, 2025 has ushered in a paradigm shift known as vibe coding. Coined by AI researchers, vibe coding represents a transition from traditional, syntax-heavy programming to a more intuitive, AI-assisted approach where developers articulate their intentions in natural language, and AI tools generate the corresponding code.
At its core, vibe coding is about conveying the desired functionality or behavior of software through conversational prompts. Instead of meticulously writing out code line by line, developers describe what they want the software to do, and AI models translate these descriptions into executable code.

Will AI Take My Job?
Anita Olsen ・ Apr 22
#discuss
        #ai
      
Sure, we code daily and AI shines at spitting out code. But most of our work is balancing expectations and handling risk.
Apart from coding, we as coders have to deal with:
Inter-team planning
Brainstorming sessions
Putting late sprints back on track
Designing requirements and user stories
Decomposing a full project into milestones
Scoping tasks with Product people
Reviewing architecture designs
Negotiating deadlines
Talking to clients
And that involves a lot of human interaction. It shouldn't surprise anyone that a coder will spend more time in meetings than coding on a normal day. And AI can't replace that human interaction yet.
But sure, our job as coders will change. Even if we're skeptical about AI, we can't ignore it. We can only assume AI will generate code faster and cheaper than any of us. We have to adapt.
We won't be code monkeys anymore, cracking lines of code in exchange for bananas. AI will handle that. And if AI will change everything, let it at least kill dumb SCRUM ceremonies.

There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals.
The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they’ll be told to “use it or lose it.”

In an April 29 X post, tech commentator Jacob Canfield shared a scam letter sent to his home via post that appeared to be from Ledger claiming he needed to immediately perform a “critical security update” on his device. 
The letter, which uses Ledger’s logo, business address, and a reference number to feign legitimacy, asks to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s private recovery phrase under the guise of validating the device.
The letter threatens that “failure to complete this mandatory validation process may result in restricted access to your wallet and funds.”

Weak labor and consumer data often precede Bitcoin rallies, leading some analysts to anticipate future economic stimulus programs.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021.

If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025.

Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening.

The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession.
The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours.

Fidelity Digital Assets says Bitcoin is undervalued and the firm holds an optimistic mid-term outlook.

The JOLTS report shows a sharp drop in open US jobs, raising investors’ hope for Fed interest rate cuts. 

According to Fidelity Digital Assets, Bitcoin’s (BTC) mid-term outlook dropped to an “optimism” zone, as the investment firm noted that BTC is trending toward “undervaluation.” 
As proof,  the firm cited the ‘Bitcoin Yardstick’ metric, which measures BTC’s market cap divided by its hashrate. A lower ratio suggests that Bitcoin is “cheaper” relative to the energy security of its network. 
In Q1 2025, the metric stayed between -1 and 3 standard deviations, cooling from its Q4 2024 overheated levels. The number of days above 2-standard deviations dropped from 22 to 15, …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed deciding on whether to greenlight two proposed cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding Dogecoin and XRP, filings show. 
The US regulator has delayed its deadline for ruling on the proposed ETF listings until June, according to two filings reviewed by Cointelegraph. 
The filings were responses to March requests from US exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX Exchange to list Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and Franklin Templeton’s XRP (XRP) ETF, respectively. 
They came on the same day that Nasdaq, another US exchange, asked for permission to list a 21Shares Dogecoin ETF. 
Dogecoin is the world’s most heavily traded memecoin, with a market capitalization of around $26 billion as of April 29, according to data from CoinGecko. X…]]></summary>

Bitcoin tends to rally significantly when low leverage meets stronger-than-expected retail sales and hawkish Federal Reserve signals.

In three separate 7-week periods, Bitcoin rose 50% to 84%.

Upcoming speeches from Fed Chair Jerome Powell could benefit Bitcoin price.

Bitcoin (BTC) price rallies are frequently linked to investors’ inflation concerns or data that surpasses expectations for economic growth, yet clear signals of an impending rally are rare. However, a combination of three independent events has historically coincided with BTC price surges of 50% or more.

Europe’s second-largest neobank, Bunq, is expanding into cryptocurrency, citing growing retail investor demand for digital assets worldwide.
The Amsterdam-based neobank announced the launch of Bunq Crypto on April 29, a new offering enabling its users to invest in over 300 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL).
Starting April 29, Bunq users in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy and Belgium will be able to access cryptocurrencies directly through the Bunq app, according to an announcement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Key Takeaways: 

Fidelity Digital Assets’ report said that multiple Ethereum onchain metrics suggest ETH trades at a discount.

The BTC/ETH market cap ratio is at mid-2020 levels. 

Ethereum's layer-2 active addresses hit new highs at 13.6 million. 

Fresh data from Fidelity Digital Assets hints at a cautiously optimistic outlook for Ethereum, suggesting its dismal Q1 performance could be an opportunity. According to their latest Signals Report, Ether (ETH) dipped 45% during Q1, wiping out it post-US election gains after peaking at $3,579 in January.
The altcoin posted a death cross in March, with the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) dipping 21% below the 200-day SMA, reflecting bearish momentum. Yet, Fidelity noted that the short-term pain may swing in the altcoin’s favor.

The move follows 21Shares’ April 10 filing of its initial proposal to launch its Dogecoin ETF, shortly after similar applications from rivals Bitwise and Grayscale. The asset manager has also sought regulators’ permission to list ETFs holding other cryptocurrencies, including Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Polkadot (DOT). 
Nasdaq must gain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before it can list and trade the fund. The request amounts to a regulatory review process that could determine whether Dogecoin becomes accessible to a broader range of investors through an ETF structure.

In an April 29 notice, the UK government announced draft rules for cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), that would bring “crypto exchanges, dealers and agents” in line with regulations, as many residents were “exposed to risky firms and scams.” It cited discussions with US government officials, including a proposed US-UK cross-border sandbox from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Hester Peirce.

AI has been a dominant narrative since 2024, but users and companies still cannot completely trust it. Whether it’s finances, personal data or healthcare decisions, hesitation around AI’s reliability and integrity remains high.
This growing AI trust deficit is now one of the most significant barriers to widespread adoption. Decentralized, privacy-preserving technologies are quickly being recognized as viable solutions that offer verifiability, transparency and stronger data protection without compromising AI’s growth.

Bitcoin (BTC) short-term holders (STHs) are back in the game as a “speculative capital” enters the market.
In an X thread on April 29, onchain analytics firm Glassnode reported a surge in Bitcoin’s so-called “hot capital.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency compliance firm Bitrace found that $649 billion worth of stablecoins flowed through addresses classified as high-risk in 2024, according to an April 29 report.
Bitrace defines high-risk blockchain addresses as those used by illegal entities to receive, transfer or store stablecoins.
Crypto compliance firms typically score crypto wallet addresses based on their likelihood of involvement in illicit activities. The higher the risk, the higher the likelihood of foul play, and the less likely compliant crypto businesses are to accept the assets.
Per the report, the amount accounted for roughly 5.14% of all stablecoin transaction volume in 2024. This is down 0.8% from 5.94% the previous year, but significantly higher than the 2.8% reported in 2022 and 1.63% in 2021.

Strong Ethereum ETF inflows signal high institutional demand.

Ethereum’s $51.8B TVL and 30% DEX weekly volume rise show robust network strength.

A bull flag pattern on the ETH’s four-hour chart targets $2,100.

Ether’s (ETH) price rose to a new range high at $1,860 on April 28, its highest value since April 2.
Several analysts argue that the ETH price needs to hold above $1,800 to increase the chances of rising higher.
“Once ETH confirms this 4H close above resistance [$1,800], Ether and altcoins will finally get their time to shine,” trader Kiran Gadakh said in an April 29 post on X.
